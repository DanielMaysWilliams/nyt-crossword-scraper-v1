In a word, no. The Center for Hmong Studies' Xiong elaborates: 

""The word 'Lao' is traditionally used to describe the Lao people, who are the majority in Laos. The Hmong are an ethnic group within the country of Laos. In Laos, the Hmong are called Hmong, even by the majority Lao. So as not to confuse people, Hmong are Hmong and Lao are Lao. It's like apples and oranges.

"DEAD SEA brought back a funny memory I haven‚Äôt thought about in ages.  Some 40 years ago, a bit out of college, and traveling, I went there on a crowded day, lots of people on the beach and standing in the water.  It was a hot day, and the water looked so inviting, I couldn‚Äôt wait to get in.  

 A wide stretch of sand stood between me and the sea, and I broke into a sprint toward what I envisioned as a refreshing splash and dunk.

At this point, in my memory, everything shifts into slow motion.  Suddenly, it seems, everyone in the hoards on the beach and in the water looked at me in panic, pointing toward me, then started waving their hands overhead in an effort to get me to stop, shouting ‚ÄúNOOOOOOOOOO!‚Äù.  

That is what I remember most, that slow-motion cinematic moment with the panicked faces, yells, and motions.  Oh, happy ending, I did stop in time, and I learned that the hyper-saline water sharply stings the eyes; it's torture to be splashed upon.  But oh, did I unite a host of humans in terror that day!

As I did at the Dead Sea that day, I sprinted through your puzzle with zeal, John-Clark.  I especially liked the four N‚Äôs in a row in the first theme answer and the rare-in-crosswords five-letter semordnilap (STROP).

A gentle-enough Wednesday with a simple trick is always welcome in my house. Also liked the clue variety and all the double letters.

"Recently, I‚Äôve been off by one on the day of the week, a phenomenon which was rare before retirement.  I was just getting properly aligned when this puzzle came along and had me thinking, waaaiiittt just a darn minute, is this really Wednesday and I‚Äôm doing the Thursday puzzle the night before, because I really thought it was Tuesday and I was doing the Wednesday puzzle the night before.

"In the constructor notes, Mr. Levin explains his rationale for choosing the surnames that we see stretched out in this puzzle.

For me, however, they're all LONG JOHNS in their own way:

GLENN -- it's a LONG way to the moon and back.

LEWIS -- it's a LONG march from Selma to Montgomery and a LONG tenure of service in the House.

ADAMS -- it's a LONG time for a President to live until 90 (until Reagan beat that record) and a LONG-term impact on the Supreme Court with the appointment of Chief Justice John MMAARRSSHHAALLLL

ELWAY -- it's a LONG touchdown drive of 98 yards to beat the Browns in the AFC Championship January 1987.",67,neutral,0.8733426332473755
"Besides the themers, astonishing number of words/phrases with double letters: Allie, naan, illegal, Ann, attests, innate, annal, eel, nee, adds, air ball, NCAA, malls, I'll be...had me seeing double!

Also admirable are some of the other dualities found here: the vertical combination of Algeria -- Heathen pared with, in precisely the same vertical on the other side,  Attests -- Glory Be, testifying to the twin pillars of Christianity & Islam that inform all of northern Africa to the Dead Sea.*   Or Dead Sea, the lowest region on earth in the NE, with Ad Astra, the highest point away from earth, in the matching SW.  History as spoken (oral) and written (annal). For example, we know from written annals that lances were indeed used, along with other pole-arms, during the Crusades, which were winding down just as Dante began writing. Those touches, meant or accidental, make this puzzle flow & glow a little more for me. Also like that Lance crosses with John Glenn: the most famous Lance these days is disgraced biker Armstrong, but back in Glenn's day, it was his buddy Neil.** Ad astra, boys!

*The same can't be said for the 3rd columns over: Illegal Android & Laotian Airball don't reverberate... or do Laotian androids play b-ball?

**Maybe not. ""Lance Armstrong"" 6.5M hits on google. ""Neil Armstrong"" 14.5M hits. 

PS: John Adams was quite portly & would have looked a sight in long johns. Critics called him His Rotundity.

"This was a perfect puzzle for the Winter we've all been having; LONGJOHNS-perfect.

I breezed through three quarters of it and then scratched my head in the SE, having to look up ELWAY and  SAMOYED. 

 ""Talk to shrilly"" completely threw me off and made no sense to me however much I stared at it. Was it a typo? I only got it when I read it as ""Talk toO shrilly.""  
Grateful if someone could explain what I'm missing.

All in all, I very much enjoyed this puzzle from the moment I saw all those Ns in GGLLEENNNN and caught on to some magic being afoot.

Thank you for a wonderful Wednesday outing, Mr. Levin!",15,positive,0.8818455934524536

Defenceless under the night
Our world in stupor lies;

Of Eros and of dust,
Beleaguered by the same
Negation and despair,
Show an affirming flame.
