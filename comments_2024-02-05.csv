As for today‚Äôs puzzle, I liked how the fighting words were vibrant not only because of their onomatopoeia, but also because of their use of higher-value Scrabble letters.

"Like Jeff Sinnock, I spent a fair part of my 1960s childhood glued to ‚ÄúBatman.‚Äù 

Fun fact: The 1966 film version of ‚ÄúBatman‚Äù premiered at the Paramount Theatre in downtown Austin (which still exists). At the time, Austin was home to Glastron, one of the first companies to build fiberglass boats ‚Äî including the Batboat. 

Thanks, Mr. Sinnock and Ms Penner, for a fun puzzle. I admire your perseverance!",8,positive,0.7368313670158386

"That was fast and fun! My only complaint is that I did it on Sunday night and now I can't do it on Monday morning! And if those are FIGHTING WORDS, they're directed at myself because I think it would have made a great fun start to my day tomorrow...  But, my need for instant gratification overwhelmed me and here we are. 

I was mildly concerned at first though, when the first two words at 1A and 4A were two such frequently used fill words (ETS and APED) but my alarm didn't last long‚Äîit was definitely a stone embedded in a crown of a puzzle! 

Loved the very enjoyable and fun surprise at the end! It was kind of a crummy weekend and that was a very real brightener! Thanks so much, dear constructors!",12,positive,0.5483821034431458

"Im so thankful you didn't give up on this puzzle, Ms. Penner and Mr. Sinnock. 
Had you shelved it, we would all have missed out on a veritable JEWEL.

And kudos also to the animation team for the surprise ending.
Throughout the solve, I had been envisioning the sound effects of the Batman fights, so to have them suddenly come to life was extraordinary.

It was a bonus to be reminded of MINOLTA, the camera that I borrowed from my brother in my teens and that ended up being gifted to me. 
It became my darling tool for capturing life around me throughout many years.

I loved everything about this puzzle.
It was a splash of happiness amid a bout of the flu (which I'll now be fighting with the appropriate sound effects...)

Thank you!",25,positive,0.9195032715797424

"Re ‚ÄúYou wanna take this outside?,‚Äù I may have related this before, so excuse me if I have.  As a newish attorney, I had a high profile trial in federal court in New Jersey.  I did not meet the opposing trial attorney until the first day of trial because he had not been involved in the discovery process.  He was cocky, experienced and . . . pugnacious.  He took an immediate disliking to me, and took great offense at my objecting  to something he said during his opening statement. By the end of the day, he was steaming. After the jury and judge left the courtroom, he expressed his displeasure and said, ‚ÄúGo back to New York, you punk.‚Äù  When I responded in a way he did not like, his next words were, ‚ÄúDo you wanna go outside?‚Äù  This was in a federal court and the courtroom deputy was still present.  When I reminded him, incredulously, that we were supposed to be above such behavior, that only made him angrier.  Luckily, his associate (whom i had gotten to know and like during discovery) restrained him and they finally left. 

That was day 1 of a three-week trial.  Needless to say, I was a bit shaken, but I managed to hold it together and justice prevailed.  By the end, we had become begrudgingly cordial.  A few months later, I received a call from a potential client.  When I asked how he had found me, he explained that the man who had recently wanted to beat me up had referred him.

Extremely fun Monday.  123 rejections!  I have a tough time dealing with one.  Bravo to you both!",88,neutral,0.5560619235038757

"The only person I know who uses  ESTOP in conversation is s blowhard attorney with an oversized EGO. 

So much to admire in this deceptively simple puzzle, including the nice clump of EI words/phrases in the NW: Seizing, One Iron, Nein and nearby Eider, the nice parings of One Iron and Even Par, of Ewe and Sow, of Oil and Silt (what a MESS). 

Happy to see KAPOW because Lewis just used it a couple days ago to describe an effect the puzzle had on him. 

Frankly, that the Daring Duo who made this puzzle submitted 123 times before getting the green light is the thing that really knocks me over. Just wow.",37,neutral,0.45372989773750305
I had scuba tanks and the rest of the puzzle done but for two downs and an across based on the t and n of tanks.  I thought I was going mad - was I really going to stumble on a Monday?  Thanks to that - way over my average and this puzzle delivered me a THWACK,17,negative,0.4545155465602875
