"I already posted about my gameplay a little bit earlier but I think I'm allowed to make two posts. Or is this where I learn about emus?! I wanted to add what I esp loved about today's puzzle, in no particular order:

1) learning the spelling of LEDE I knew the phrase but had no idea it was spelled that way.

2) the clue for SALAD.... newbie me liked that it didn't trick me - and it made punny me smile!

3) the clue for TRYSTS! It did trick me and apparently there's some part of me that enjoys being tricked. Also made me smile!

4) learning that FOAM PARTY is a thing! I think it's a thing that clumsy old me won't be partaking in but it does sound like a hoot!

5) a bit of a more personal one... The clue and answer Drove / RUN reminds me in a bittersweet way of one of my dearest friends in the world, who quite unexpectedly died at 40. I knew him since early high school. Anyhow, whenever one would say something like I'm going to run to the store, he'd say without fail, ""Why don't you drive, it's faster!?"" Har har!  It was just one of his many quirky things and now every time anyone says something like that to me, I repeat his line. My darling husband, who has heard it from me a million times, is endlessly patient and always laughs in memory with me. My friend's many isms are one of the many ways he lives on!

"Loved it! This was my 98th solve and what fun it was!! I pretty easily got the south east and I knew FRIENDSGIVING from the get-go but struggled until I corrected PASSes to PASSUP  and like dominoes, the entire lower two-thirds of the puzzle fell into place for me! It felt ridiculously happy and satisfied! I was only sad that my husband wasn't here at the moment to hear my huzzah!

I hoped I would make it without doing a puzzle check today but, alas, at about 2/3rds through I really got caught in the northwest corner. This was largely due to my desire to keep tbsp as the recipe part, which didn't work with the crosses that I also wanted to keep. Lacking confidence and in the interest of time (I'm sloooow!), decided I better do one. I was shocked that the only thing I had wrong in the whole section below the TDS line was SOuP bar, and the only things incomplete down there were thusly TALON and REST.

"When I was 21 I went to a FOAM PARTY at an 18+ club in Myrtle Beach. Amidst the clouds of foam, I befriended a 19-year-old girl who wanted to enter the wet t-shirt contest. Alas, the contest was sponsored by some trashy alcohol brand, almost certainly Captain Morgan‚Äôs Parrot Bay coconut-flavored rum now that I think about it, so although you only needed to be 18 to be in the club, you had to be at least 21 to go up on stage and twerk to Lil Jon. In an inspiring act of feminist solidarity, I let her borrow my ID‚Äîand she WON the wet t-shirt contest, which, legally, means I won the wet t-shirt contest. This is my favorite achievement on my r√©sum√©. Thanks for the memories, Hoang-Kim! 

I am basically not excited by cooking, or even food in general, so ESCAROLE (a word I‚Äôve probably only encountered on occasional fine-dining menus) and SHEET PAN (I wanted P_N to be a rolling pin) crossing with OSHEA (I ought to brush up on rappers‚Äô legal names) were what held me up the longest in what was otherwise a pretty breezy Saturday. 

Now I‚Äôm off to take my minimal-effort green bean casserole down to today‚Äôs FRIENDSGIVING at a friend‚Äôs place in DC, where as I pass by the Capitol building I will be working hard to repress any further intrusive images of former Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) engaged in a most unsavory congress.

"I was out of sync with this one, I think partly because several of clue/answer sets were likewise out of sync. 

Maybe BEANIE means something different to others but to me it‚Äôs not typically knitted. Is it akin to a ‚Äútoque‚Äù?

We don‚Äôt call flat metal cooking sheets SHEETPANS, we call them cookie sheets no matter what we‚Äôre putting on them. At least as far as I know. 

I couldn‚Äôt remember SANSA. Kept thinking Sanya, Sarya?

I suppose NOISES clued as ‚ÄúBangs, eg‚Äù is fair for a Saturday but clueing plural SLATS with singular ‚ÄúMattress support‚Äù is not. 

OOPS isn‚Äôt actually the same as ‚ÄúMy bad!‚Äù  Better answer would be ONME. Maybe ‚Äú______ a daisy!‚Äù would have been a better clue.

Liked ""Sharp point on a kite"" for TALON, and MAELSTROM is such a nice entry. ""Brown-y points, for short?"" for TDS seems rather silly, assuming the clue is referring to the Cleveland football team. Or maybe I'm missing something.

Had to guess at the crossing of SANSA and OSHEA, but an A seemed best. Had PREGNANTPAUSE ... until SECTOR appeared and terminated that.

I've never heard of FRIENDSGIVING, but I love the idea. 

Is a FOAM PARTY like a beer party?  I've never heard of it.  And CLAW GAME was one big ""Huh?""

It's taken me a year of xwords just to learn DEETS.  And now we have ""the 411""???  Good grief. 

There's a ""Hamburglar""?  

Even in areas I'm well-versed in, like liquor, I couldn't for the life of me come up with FRUITIER without many crosses.  I was thinking STRONGER.  Or SWEETER.  Or SOURER.  Or  LIMIER.  Or COLDER.   The -ITIER was driving me crazy.

The YIPS isn't just a phenomenon in gymnastics.  In golf it means that you tank on very short putts.  In tennis, it means that you can't control your toss when serving.

I used to grow radicchio, which I much preferred to ESCAROLE.

Must tell our DiL about ZOOM HOST in the puzzle; she arranges our fun meetings every other Sunday--always a treat to see one another despite the many miles between WA-MS-OH (and 3 different time zones.)

Could somebody please explain?",6,negative,0.5112142562866211
"Minor nit: 35D. would be better worded in the singular, ‚Äúadd-on.‚Äù

The C (content) of DLC is uncountable, no argument, there, grammatically. A DLC, itself, could comprise one or many ‚Äúthings.‚Äù 

But therein lies the language. I said ‚Äúa DLC,‚Äù could have said, ‚Äúthe DLC,‚Äù or, yes, ‚Äúthe DLCs,‚Äù when referring to a single, post-release add-on (the formers) or add-ons (the latter).

Point being, DLC is pluralized, regardless the number of features or items or mechanics, etc., make up any one DLC.

"So...the solve...HOW WAS IT?
Well, definitely sweeter than yesterday. FRUITIER. Not at all a MAELSTROM. More like a thousand OASES, if you 
will.

But I will ADMIT to taking a REST mid-way, remembering to not PASS UP on FRIENDS GIVING of good advice (hello, Warren): ""Don't get impatient. Relax. Take a break and then come back to it.""

And so I took a DRAMATIC PAUSE -- though the only drama, really, was coming from Sting, on YouTube, singing about how I consider him the young apprentice caught between the Scylla and [Charybdes]:
https://youtu.be/svWINSRhQU0?feature=shared
And so I suddenly find I have new ZEST, knowing he'll be wrapped around my finger.

 I immediately return to the puzzle and [proceed with gusto], and a FOAM PARTY ensues for the second half of the solve. INSIGHT bubbles in my brain, spilling out onto the grid, INSIGHT bubbles everywhere, until at last I get to the finish line.

And now... under a sky with a gold star, I SIP some champagne, feeling proud and satisfied.

I raise my glass to you, Mr. Vu.

"I struggled in the NW on this one. 

I was not familiar with HRT, SANSA, or OSHEA. (Sorry, Eric, I think there are too many Starks to remember for someone who doesn't watch GOT. The only Stark I know well is Tony.) For Charybdis, I had ""eddy"" and ""whirlpool"" in my mind but not MAELSTROM. Nice!

In the middle, FRIENDSGIVING and DLC were new to me too.

But I'm not complaining. It's good to have a tough Saturday every once in a while.

"Really enjoyed today's puzzle, hope to see more from Vu!

I've become somewhat of a kite watcher/lover, they're such beautiful and graceful fliers, and amazing hunters.

Eating an onigiri in the park one day, with an absorbing Kindle read in my other hand, went to take a bite of lunch only to be flummoxed by suddenly empty hand. Then I saw the kite flying away with my food, its undoubtedly sharp and powerful talons holding my rice ball so tenderly, could've crumbled to pieces but she didn't drop a grain.

The theft was completely clean, stealthy, unnoticed. She swept down/in from behind, came over my left shoulder, took my delicate food from my hand (at speed!), nothing but net. I never heard her coming, never felt a thing - not even the onigiri leaving my hand!

I wasn't at all upset - I actually smiled, and literally (yes, literally) started clapping, such a spectacular performance!",95,positive,0.9606844186782837

ADIDAS was a lucky guess, but it's eastern counterpart, BIG MAC was the first thing I put, and a gimme.  I used to work at Mickey D's as a high school and college student.
