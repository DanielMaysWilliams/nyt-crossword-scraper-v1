"I don‚Äôt normally have much to say about a Monday since they often fly right by. But all 7 minutes of this was so enjoyable, and the completed fill is top-notch. My favorite clue/answer is at 10D, as the closest I‚Äôve ever come to a theater camp experience was the summer after 9th grade when I went to Existentialism Camp and spent 7 hours a day reading Sartre and Camus and acting out their weird little plays, among them ‚ÄúThe Flies‚Äù and ‚ÄúNo Exit,‚Äù with a bunch of fellow 13‚Äì14-year-olds.

Today marks Day 101 in my gold-star streak (yay üí´) and was a much needed clean-cut victory after this past week of frustrating flyspecking at the end of nearly every puzzle thanks to many typos introduced by the hand injury I got at FRIENDSGIVING ten days ago, no, not from cooking, but from plunging my hand a little too zealously into an ice-packed cooler for another beer while sporting a much-too-long manicure that was way overdue for a professional trim. Anyway. I‚Äôve now shared two very relatable anecdotes in this comment so I‚Äôll wrap it up.

The theme was very cute, but TOBEFAIR I was too delighted by reading the revealer in my finest, most highly affected British accent ala Letterkenny to actually notice the pun until I read the column.

I've always considered CAREER/CAREEN (6D)to be a kealoa.  I liked CAREEN better in the case of this clue, so I wrote down the ""N"" in very pale ink.  But then I saw that the last 4 letters of 26A had to be cArS, so I changed the N to an R in CAREEr.  And there's an N to start.  Could the Altimas and Pathfinders be NaScArS? (I had been thinking SUV CARS, but that didn't fit with what I had.

"[Astrology *chart*] for ZODIAC seemed a pretty odd clue, and even threw me off at 1A for a while. To me, ""Zodiac"" is the ordered system of constellations, and ""Horoscope"" is the chart created through it, astrologically. Now, BA and others will often cite a second or third usage at M-W to support the clue, but looking there, and in the OED, I can find no usage of ""Zodiac"" in that way, unless you take ""chart"" in a very broad sense.

"Bada Bing!  I got a Big Bang out of this.  A Black Belt to Ricky, who pulled off a NYT debut with nary a Boo Boo.

Some memorable moments:
‚Ä¢ Having the CAR of CAREEN filled in and being briefly confused because ‚Äúcar‚Äù is in the clue, and the deep aha when the final answer filled in..
‚Ä¢ Filling in BANANA bread, and actually being able to smell the aroma as if it were in front of me.  Then taking a pause to savor it.
‚Ä¢ Double imaginary fist pump when I had GNON only, then the answer popped into my head and I actually spelled it right.
‚Ä¢ Leaving the revealer blank, trying to guess it, having seen the BBs in the theme answers, thinking it had to do with ‚Äúto be or not to be‚Äù (Hi, @Neil Bellinson!), rejecting that, then, after reading the clue, and with an explosion of joy, figuring it out.  Joy, because I‚Äôm weak at this skill and working on it.

"What a super fun Monday puzzle!! Pure delight!! I went through faster than normal, which was fun! I felt like I was just on the same wavelength as the clues, which isn't always the case. That said, I got a few things wrong on that first go-around. I had ZACk -- and I got the rest of that section completed really quickly so I never noticed that I had kERO so obviously wrong -- until I didn't get the happy music. Additionally, I first had IN A sec, instead of FEW and penned instead of NOTATE. As a newcomer, I still find myself getting messed up on tenses. I have to get better at that. So those couple things messed me up a bit but I resolved them pretty quickly.

I said this earlier in a response to someone else's comment but the other thing that briefly made me hesitate was BEER BRAT... I immediately knew it was a brat but I'm from Milwaukee and lived there half my life, so I only think of it as a brat. In the first go round, I couldn't figure out why it was eight letters! üòÜ I mean, clearly a brat will be cooked in beer, as is only right and proper! How else would a person do it!? Yet, I have lived the second half of my life in Minnesota where brats are very, very different. While I love both of my states, MN folks do not know how to cook a brat!
