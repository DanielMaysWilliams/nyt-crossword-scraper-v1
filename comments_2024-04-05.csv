No blue skies for me today! This is one of those puzzles that makes me humbly remember that I've got a verrrrry long way to go before I'm actually good at doing crosswords. All I can say for myself is that I immediately knew SILENT DISCO. They had one at a gala I attended a few years ago. I didn't feel the need to participate but it was memorable sight to behold. 

I also immediately had UNO, JANE EYRE, and TIMOR, the latter of which I'm proud of because I know it from my geography game. I'd be way worse at the crosswords if I hadn't been doing that game for a year before trying out the crosswords. I waited on the always delicious NAAN because I sometimes get fooled with roti.

"I get the impression that several posters missed the literal ‚Äúthey (cabooses) bring up the rear.‚Äù The caboose is (now mostly obsolete, having faded from use) the rearmost car of a train. Caboose comes last for several reasons. The crew is quartered there, and usually have a stove for warmth and cooking. From a raised box on the roof with windows on all sides, they can look out over the train and check for problems. From an open platform on the back they can signal to the rear. They have braking capability in order to assist with sudden stops.
The slang use for caboose to mean rear end is a simple adoption of the name of the car that literally brings up the rear. The clue is simply factual.

I looked it up and found that SLUE is indeed defined as a sudden violent turning often about an axis. I infer it is a sailing term because one definition refers to a mast as a specific example. I don't sail much, and never in such rough weather that my mast SLUEs. But the nautical lexicon is bottomless compared with my limited vocabulary.

"The operative word is ""perhaps."" Many fast food chain restaurants do not pay a living wage, and yet forbid employees to receive tips.

The whole notion of tipping is fraught with inconsistencies: should one tip for take-out? At a small, family-run restaurant or business, where the cook, the waitress, the (underage) busser, and the youngster sitting under your table drawing in a coloring book are of one household? (Oh, how I miss that Thai food!) What about that swank restaurant whereat the server takes your order and brings you your check, and everything in between is done by the busser and the food-runner? Not to mention the cook, who probably makes a higher wage, but clears a lower final income (no hostility there, no not a bit!)

At my hotel, the (unionized) banquet servers and bartenders do not accept tips, but in the end clear a living income (along with a healthy benefit package), but then the ""gratuity"" is written into the banquet contract--what does that mean?

West/SW really hurt me. definitely took longer than average. But satisfied to get the gold.

"Really liked this! It felt like a fair Friday - appeared obtuse at first, but after cracking a few, solvable through working at it. The top left quadrant had me stuck for a long time until I hazarded the guess of OLGA, which got the rest open for me. I genuinely enjoyed doing it and the two long fills (COMMIT TO THE BIT and CREEPY CRAWLIES) were both wonderful.",12,positive,0.9603275656700134

"I was nervous going in after not filling many initially but was able to keep chipping away as I filled in more and more with the crosses! Felt a sense of ESPRIT getting the long downs but finally had to EASE into googling for the NE corner. Happy to report I am not INDISARRAY after completion. 

Ps. Went to a SILENTDISCO in 2019 and it was one of the most fun parties I‚Äôve been to! Emus take note üï∫",4,positive,0.7153767347335815
"It's such a great feeling to go from zero (and blank stares) to a filled-in grid and no recollection of how it happened, only disbelief that it actually did.

But that's the sign of a great constructor, as RG is ‚Äì someone whose execution of the puzzle makes the solve seem insurmountable at first, but then allows for it to all fall into place with no suffering, just a lot of smiles and ahas.

Thank you, Rebecca, for gracing us with your absurd talent and expertise!

The only thing I'm not thankful for, however, is the DISCO rabbit hole I ended up going down. Why would I do that to myself?

Sure I had some fun back then, and there were even a few songs I liked (like this one:
https://youtu.be/fT42ocqmI9s?feature=shared)
but boy was I glad when the 80's came along with New Wave.

But going down the DISCO rabbit hole is all on me and turned out to be a good reminder ‚Äì I didn't love it then, and I still don't love it now.

To Rebecca, best of luck in the tournament.
And to Deb, thank you for the hilarious picture!",18,positive,0.6196518540382385
"The wordplay column seems proud of the clue ‚Äúvolleyball doubles‚Äù, but I hated it.   The Times seems to have more such clues lately, but to me they are like cryptic clues and should have no place in a crossword puzzle.",12,negative,0.8591729402542114
"It feels like a very good Friday indeed when ""I can't possibly fill this grid"" becomes ""I did it!"" 

This felt just right for a Friday. ""Resistance figure"" OHM became cHe and then back to OHM. GOES BonkerS became GOES BANANAS. And CREEPY CRAWLerS became CREEPY CRAWLIES.

Spin becoming SpUn and then SLUE really made me question if I could fill the entire grid on my own. It felt wonderful to actually do so.",13,positive,0.9379428029060364

"A little saltier than a standard Friday.

Harder, I mean. 

The start had me flummoxed until the end. FADE FROM USE hints at a loss of color, and the LOCAL COLOR sitting above it creates a ROOF or the MOON or some other HIGH POINT ‚Ä¶ if I could explain exactly why it was hard to put together I probably wouldn‚Äôt need to.

I don‚Äôt think it is an accident or a flaw, in fact the more correctly I answered the clues the more hazardous the puzzle became.

MAMA and PAPA bear before BRER bear; WARSHIP before SPYSHIP; BONKERS before BANANAS and SAFE before EASE to name a few. 

Things I still don‚Äôt quite grasp: ONYX, ICON.

TV shows I still have never watched: Game of Thrones and Below Deck.

"Loved how this puzzle threw me around. 

Or maybe I threw myself around. ""They bring up the rear"" did have me thinking caboose at first, but I was thrown by feeling that cabooses bring up TO the rear, and I felt obliged to search for answers that might better match the cluing. Like girdles bring up the rear. A letter too short. Knickers works. Or maybe it's something like botox, way too short, but perhaps botoxins. Then there's silicons, which fits. The problem is they tend to bring OUT the rear, rather than UP.  Or maybe it's people who bring up ""the rear"" in conversation. Horses rear, so possibly an equestrian or a rodeo clown. Or a proctologist. Or those stripmall ""doctors"" who'll give you a Brazilian lift. They might bring it up in conversation. As would artisanal piano bench makers in Williamsburg. Oh well, go with caboose, what can you lose?

Jane Eyre, what a novel. What a role model in her way. And to have LEO in the puzzle, summoning his Anna Karenina, boy, if the two of them were in a room together Etna would look like your local steam room at the YMCA. I can just imagine Vronsky's version: ""Reader, I married her. And that was my first and greatest mistake.""

"With this Friday debut Rebecca has now hit for the cycle, having a puzzle published each day of the week. And what a great one she constructed for the milestone. 

It sparkles with such fresh entries as CREEPY CRAWLIES, GO OBSOLETE, SILENT DISCO and COMMIT TO THE BIT and clever wordplay like ‚ÄúThey bring up the rear‚Äù for CABOOSES . But my *most* favorite clue by far is  ‚ÄúReader, I married him‚Äù  for JANE EYRE.

Congratulations, Rebecca!  Excellent puzzle. 

Good luck at ACPT.",22,positive,0.969477117061615

"I really thought I was not going to make it here - just far too many unknowns.  But some of my early guesses that I mentally penciled in - e.g., BANC - survived to the end.  That was the only French word I could think of with four letters that was chair-ish, so I put it in fully expecting it to be eventually erased.  And then the SW corner slowly came into focus.  

WHOD seemed like a possibility; a neuron stirred and gave me WEBB for the telescope; BRER came from nowhere; and of course Ralphie and his Red RYDER BB gun was there all along.  I had one tiny stepping stone to the other side and I made it under my average. An excellent Friday-level puzzle and well worth the effort.",13,neutral,0.5700446367263794
