"I'm not a fan of poetry for the most part, but what I do like, I really like.  Frost is one I really like - his poems are very simple and straightforward - not frilly or pretentious at all - but paint a picture in my head so easily. I still remember the exact picture in my head from ""Mending Wall"" when I read it in 5th grade - two neighbors slowly waking on each side of an unmortared stone wall, the same type of wall the ruins of which ran through all the woods I spent most of my childhood in, slowly picking up the fallen rocks and re-placing them, while chatting about nothing. And the sentiment of the poem was shared by me, which made it resonate even more.

Stopping by Woods is much shorter, but gives me the indescribable feeling of being alone at the edge of the woods at dusk, with snow falling all around, enjoying the silence and maybe the mystery of the dark woods, as if I was there.  The forces pulling me away?... not in my head version of the poem üòÅ

Agreed, absolutely. I just came back from two weeks in France, and though I speak fairly good French, I found myself puzzling over unfamiliar uses or combinations of familiar words.

In my current state of mind, I can't judge the puzzle fairly but I have read through the comments and am surprised that so many people hated it. 

I've long known the poem, in fact when Robert Frost's Two Roads poem showed up a week or two ago, I briefly mixed it up with this one, which comes to mind fairly often for me, and which did help me once I had some crosses filled in to get at the reimagining. 

I share this in case our dear constructor is reading these comments, I'd like them to know that the only smiles I cracked today were in this crossword puzzle. I especially loved the clue for AHA, which usually has such a boring clue, and when I finally completed the southeast, I chuckled at the GIDDY UP and the theme. I also really enjoyed the clues for RISES and STRAP. Loses a lap and what a clutch lacks, I believe.

"I've read all the comments and now I feel like there's something wrong with me and how my mind works when playing *any* NYT game.

To me, in the back of my mind, there's *always* a search for what the constructor was thinking and how they think.

I see whichever game as a constructor's unique creative expression that I'm being invited to dwell upon and decipher, as if I were being invited into their minds.

As such, the fact that I knew Frost's poem didn't alter for me the process of unveiling Mr. O'Neill's mysterious reimagining of it. 
I had no idea if it would be serious, snarky, or jokey. 
And that, yes, made it hard, but perhaps not any harder than for someone who didn't know the poem. I still had to rely on crosses.

The only difference, in my possibly wrong opinion, is that those who didn't know the poem were deprived of the ensueing laughter.

And so, I'm rather taken aback by the comments that deride the puzzle because the poem was unknown, and a few that imply ""how am I supposed to know how it was reimagined?""
Which takes me back to thinking there's something wrong with me. 
""How am I supposed to know what the constructor intended?"" is exactly what attracts me to a puzzle or any other game. I'm drawn in *to find out*!

Sometimes I succeed, and sometimes I don't.

"Got a big kick out of this one, and as I mentioned elsewhere it sent me down a Frostiana rabbit hole, so thanks for that. 

Like many, I'm surprised at the hate. Also, I resent the implication by many who hated it that we here in the comments section are all a bunch of Pollyannas who refuse to criticize a puzzle that is clearly bad. I think it's pretty unlikely that the NYTimes would publish a puzzle that was clearly bad. I liked today's puzzle, and not in spite of it being bad; to me it wasn't bad. The quality of the puzzle is an opinion, not a hard fact.

@Andrzej, who liked the puzzle, questioned whether the crowd here has a double standard--happily accepting positive comments but requiring negative comments to be explicit about what they hated. It's an interesting point, but ultimately not one with which I agree. I don't think compliments need to be defended; I like it when folks play nice. [although usually people *do* mention what they liked--a particular clue or seeing a particular word in the grid.]

Everyday someone will not like the puzzle, and most days someone will come here to say so. I absolutely agree that this is the place for that, but I do want to know why if possible.

I guess I was hoping for slightly more fun/humor/WILY usage when I immediately lit upon Clue 17A, which of course was a bit of a giveaway...  (Though at least this time I did not conflate two of the most-familiar poems.)  

We were 'softened up' previously to the 27D word.  You know, it could still start with a W; that might be less grating.

So, when I saw that today‚Äôs theme was a reparsing of a Frost poem, I knew it wouldn‚Äôt help my solving. Also, as those four unclued spanners meant that this was going to be like a quotation crossword, I knew I would have to fill in those spanners exclusively through context and crosses.

Therefore, I approached this as simply a puzzle, a grid to fill in, a grid with a challenging theme.  As it turns out, there were also challenges from the rest of the grid, due to no-knows and devilish cluing.

"Here it is so next time you'll know it.

Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening
By Robert Frost

Whose woods these are I think I know.   
His house is in the village though;   
He will not see me stopping here   
To watch his woods fill up with snow.   

My little horse must think it queer   
To stop without a farmhouse near   
Between the woods and frozen lake   
The darkest evening of the year.   

He gives his harness bells a shake   
To ask if there is some mistake.   
The only other sound‚Äôs the sweep   
Of easy wind and downy flake.   

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   
But I have promises to keep,   
And miles to go before I sleep,   
And miles to go before I sleep.

Raise your hand if you can recite it, as most school children can.",77,neutral,0.7650986313819885
"I know this poem from, of all things, the 1977 film Telefon starring Charles Bronson and Donald Pleasence. The premise is that a bunch of hypnotized sleeper cell agents have been planted in the US to live normal lives until someone calls them up and recites to them this poem. Upon hearing it, they snap out of it and do the dirty deed they were programmed to do.

They don‚Äôt make ‚Äòem like that anymore!

Though the theme version was so randomly different, having key words in my recent memory banks no doubt helped. And the GIDDYUP just haddabe.

An ode to a classic poem that,

"I yield my time to Marianne Moore:

Poetry (1935)

I, too, dislike it: there are things that are important beyond all this fiddle.
Reading it, however, with a perfect contempt for it, one discovers in
it after all, a place for the genuine.
Hands that can grasp, eyes
that can dilate, hair that can rise
if it must, these things are important not because a
high-sounding interpretation can be put upon them but because they are
useful. When they become so derivative as to become unintelligible,
the same thing may be said for all of us, that we
do not admire what
we cannot understand: the bat
holding on upside down or in quest of something to

eat, elephants pushing, a wild horse taking a roll, a tireless wolf under
a tree, the immovable critic twinkling his skin like a horse that feels a flea, the base-
ball fan, the statistician ‚Äì
nor is it valid
to discriminate against ‚Äòbusiness documents and school-books‚Äô;
all these phenomena are important. One must make a distinction
however: when dragged into prominence by half poets, the result is not poetry,
nor till the poets among us can be
‚Äòliteralists of the imagination-' above

insolence and triviality and can present

for inspection, ‚Äòimaginary gardens with real toads in them,‚Äô shall we have
it. In the meantime, if you demand on one hand,
the raw material of poetry in
all its rawness, and
that which is on the other hand
genuine, then you are interested in poetry.",20,neutral,0.6216306090354919

Yes, it helped that I know the poem pretty well.

Nonetheless, I found the terse paraphrase grew more difficult to guess as the puzzle progressed, leading to ""Aha!"" moments at the end of the last two lines. üí°

My only, relatively minor, compliant: the crossing of 30D and 34A felt like a bit of a Natick. I assumed these two entries were two obscure proper nouns and I initially entered MonA for 34A.

But more than anything else, out of the first six comments, nearly all of them indicate that the original poem is not well known anymore.  I find that amazing.  I consider this one and ""The Road Not Taken"" (also by Frost) to be among the most famous American poems ever written.
