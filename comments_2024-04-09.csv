"Great puzzle! Loved it, some nice long fills and it was fun to solve.

I enjoyed a bit of puzzle synergy last night as I was reading before bed: a character demonstrates the SIPHONing technique in order to empty a vessel and get to the sediment at the bottom, complete with a scientific explanation of the phenomenon. Reminded me of the clue/fill in yesterday's puzzle. 

In case anyone's interested, it's from An Instance of the Fingerpost by Iain Pears, which essentially tucks a murder mystery inside a novel about the birth of the scientific method - might resonate with some of this crowd.

I stumbled upon the rec from an NYT Books column, and it reminds me quite a bit of The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco, whose main character is modeled on William of Ockham, of the RAZOR. Synergy!",8,positive,0.9571017026901245

"I am almost 100% sure that this is a first-person CATE BLANCHETT story.

A beautiful day in Central Park about 5 years ago.  I'm walking down the hill that leads from the bridle path at East 97th street to the tennis courts.  On the grass adjacent to the hill, an irresistible Golden Retriever (my favorite breed) is cavorting off-leash, sporting a wide smile that would melt anyone's heart.  I do not even notice its person at first. 

Its person is a tall woman dressed in understated dog-walking clothes and I say something to her about the sheer wonderfulness of her dog.  She says something back to me-- very curt, not at all warm and fuzzy -- and scurries off up the hill I have just come down.  And while I don't recognize her face at all, I'm struck by that VOICE!  I know that VOICE! It's the voice of an actress.  Whose voice IS it????  I have to know.  I HAVE TO KNOW!!

And by the time I get to the bottom of the hill, I DO know.  It's CATE BLANCHETT.  Leaving me with two ways to interpret the incident:

1) CATE BLANCHETT is not a very nice person and, besides, she's sick and tired of having her life interrupted by gawking strangers because of her celebrity status.

2) CATE BLANCHETT likes being recognized. She EXPECTS to be recognized.  And she certainly doesn't like playing second fiddle to a...dog!",11,positive,0.8328719735145569

Also think of their different exposures to world events. Will was born when Truman was president; Joel when HW Bush was in office. Shortz was 37 when the WWW was born in 1989; Fagliano was -3. Then there are the ""police actions"" and wars prior to 1992. And so on.

"Although this puzzle had no more than the usual number of food entries, for some reason this one felt like *real* work--whether that ARTY TAPAS menu, with little servings of YAM fritters (three per plate, when served to party of two or four) and tuna tartare served in little savory pastry CONES, or the fancy French bistro, where everything is served A LA CARTE, even the bread for your Escargot au beurre √†  l'AIL, and where the wine list has a wide of selection of CABS. Very impressive, until I get the dessert menu, and realize one of the options is Gateaux au Chocolat LAVA:-(

Just don't over cook your PENNE, and bring proteins up to their safe internal TEMPS.

But I can't over stress the virtue of blanching one's broccoli!  Whether you ultimately use it cold on a crudite platter, or hot in a stir fry or pasta primavera, or just reheat it in a microwave just before serving as a side. Drop it for a minute or a minute and a half, then shock it in ice water. It gives it that beautiful emerald green color. And if you're not too persnickety about things, and want to save the dishwasher a pot, blanch it in the same pot of water you then use to cook pasta, etc. It's the little things.

"I love the theme idea and the puzzle itself, but I‚Äôm conflicted about the editing. I had the whole puzzle solved with the theme entries entered as a split rebus: ex. WARREN BUFF E/I T (to maintain the correct spellings in both directions). When I didn‚Äôt get the music, I changed them to I‚Äôs and was rewarded. 

I have always thought that the NYT doesn‚Äôt allow intentional misspellings (also confused by YADDA and LOOPER - I‚Äôve never seen YADA spelled that way and I‚Äôve always only heard BLOOPER). One of the reasons I almost exclusively choose to do the NYT puzzle is that I know they are well edited and solvable with real words. When I consulted my trusty ‚ÄúHow to Conquer the New York Times Crossword Puzzle‚Äù book by Amy Reynaldo (an excellent help for new solvers!), however, I was surprised not to find that basic rule.

So, my question for the editors is why not do it as a split rebus and maintain the correct spellings of people‚Äôs names and have the theme come out in how it‚Äôs pronounced rather than how it‚Äôs spelled?

Also, as a person with a weirdly spelled name, I prefer spelling people‚Äôs names correctly. As Dale Carnegie once said, ‚ÄúA person's name is, to that person, the sweetest and most important sound in any language.""",1,neutral,0.5964255332946777

Congrats to the puzzlemakers on their fine, witty, lively debut.

Eclipse news. The sun actually shown here in Pittsburgh, a rarity in itself. As it edged toward 3:18, the Time of Totality*, I put Louie, the mini-aussie, on a leash and ventured out. There were people all over the neighborhood, in their yards, on their balconies, most with the requisite blue special glasses you could get at the local convenience store (or on Amazon). Stupid me, I had nothing but a plastic bag to collect Louie's opinions about life. The light was odd, almost like everything was hypercolorized, there was a grayish cast that was pearly and luminous at the same time, and there was a stillness as if the birds and the insects had been silenced by the oddity of this event. In eclipses past, some of the larger mammals at the local zoo had immediately started mating during the greatest darkness, but Louie and I did not feel those urges, toward each other or anybody else. Occasionally I'd look directly at the sun for a split second, expecting to see ... you know, the black disc of the moon with an aureole of fire...but saw only what looked like the sun. The bag, full by now, was no help.
