"LORDY! What a naughty little puzzle!!  BOOTY CALLS, SHAGging, RAWRing, and BANNED BOOKS!! Mercy me, alright!! (Fanning myself)

I loved it!! I giggled like a junior higher at booty calls! 

My proudest moment was figuring out the atomic number bit. It's been a very long time since I've even thought about a periodic table! 

My biggest hang up was putting HIDDEN Flaw instead of FEES. Which is funny cuz I kind of thought that hidden fees might be the answer to ""Covered cost"" for a while.

Because ""at. no."" is pretty much that.  ""At"" is not a recognized shorthand for atomic, while ""no."" for number is...would ""atono,"" for a five-blank fill, be acceptable?

I was completely flummoxed in the NW and while the phrase STUFFY NOSE is great fill, the clue for it...isn't. If it's STUFFY, it doesn't run above the bridge either. 

The only thing I got immediately on the entire left side of the puzzle was GET.  Thank you, Barbara Walters.

But that was hardly enough.  I struggled in the East, too with HIDDEN COST ""confirmed"" by CIA, before I realized it was HIDDEN FEES, confirmed by FBI.

To have PDF and JPGS in the same puzzle was too much of a bad thing.

Once I'd limped to the finish line -- without any cheats, I might add -- I realized that there was some quite wonderful and lively fill in the puzzle: BOOTY CALLS; SPOILED ROTTEN; SHOOK THINGS UP; TINSELTOWN; BANNED BOOKS, as clued (and what does that teach you, Ron de S?); and UP TO NO GOOD.   

I wish I'd enjoyed it as much while solving as I did after I finished solving.

Webster‚Äôs Dictionary and Thesaurus for Students, Merriam-Webster‚Äôs Elementary Dictionary, the American Heritage Children‚Äôs Dictionary and other titles were pulled from schools in Escambia County, Fla., where officials are reviewing books for compliance with the law‚Äôs prohibition on materials with ‚Äúsexual‚Äù content.

Also investigated were the World Book Encyclopedia of People and Places, the World Almanac and Book of Facts, and other reference books on topics including science, mythology and the Bible, according to a list published by the school district and circulated this week by PEN America, [which] has sued the school board over the removals.

It demonstrates how sweeping the state‚Äôs new rules are and how fraught the climate in districts has become, said Kasey Meehan, director of PEN America‚Äôs Freedom to Read program.

‚ÄúThis was just another example that illuminates the heightened atmosphere, the chilled atmosphere that we‚Äôre navigating,‚Äù Meehan said. ‚ÄúLibrarians are feeling so pressured to err on such extreme caution that these are the types of books that are being pulled for review.‚Äù",23,neutral,0.6928690671920776
I find it far more bizarre that a dictionary would be banned than a Where's Waldo book. Some of those beach scenes are a little sketchy in places! What a wally.,5,negative,0.9151806235313416
25D (the Austin Powers clue) is Brit-slang for sexual intercourse roughly equivalent to but a shade less opprobrious than another four letter term.  The clue is accurate - it's what Mr Powers said - but it is still odd to see it in a family newspaper.,4,neutral,0.7129088640213013
"I thought the cluing for this puzzle had been turned up an extra notch. Examples:

17A ""It doesn't run below the bridge""
20A ""Rough patch?""
37A ""A-list guest, to a host""
45A ""Things that are best kept low, in brief""
8D ""High ways?""
14D ""The seasons, e.g.""

Like others here, I had to jump around the grid, entering answers here and there, even if they were just stabs, e.g., VOTE, ALOE, ANTS, PIKE, OTOE, MIATA, in areas I had nothing else.

But like every other puzzle, with a bit of effort the other answers start to emerge, including some names that had to be pulled out of the recesses of my memory -- RIDE, ADLER,  ASTOR, DOWD.

In a few places I had to ""erase"": rank instead of IDLE, bed instead of COT, occlude instead of BLOT OUT, and scOop instead of FLOAT.

My verdict? Hemant's puzzle definitely SHOOK THINGS UP. Maybe I've been SPOILED ROTTEN by easier late-week puzzles recently. Good thing I didn't have to solve this one with a STUFFY NOSE.",21,neutral,0.6710869073867798
"Intriguing carnal sub-theme: a BANNED BOOK novel could be told using the key words BAE, BOOTY CALLS, BANGERS, BARES, BONES, CHAP, RIDE, SHOOK THINGS UP, UP TO NO GOOD, SHAG, ON A ROLL, COT...by the time I got to RAWR I felt I was caught up in the IDLE speculations of some stuffy nosed lad with acne no tissues could quite BLOT OUT. 

These days all you have to do is click on various JPGs to get the idea, but some of us grew up in different ERAS, when the possible love between Sherlock Holmes and IRENE ADLER (what a great feat to sneak her into this puzzle!), was enough to pep us up. What's that? Reading SEDATES you? Well you can watch what TINSEL TOWN has made of their relationship in ""Game of Shadows"" (2011); Rachel MacAdams is not quite as I envisioned Irene Adler, who was based on the beautiful Lillie Langtry, but who cares? Watson assures us that even though Sherlock referred to her as ""The Woman,"" his affection for her was purely Platonic. I certainly never thought of him as much of a hugger. Still, Holmes liked a toot of cocaine once in a while. And you thought that stuffy nose was just a common cold. Lordy.",36,neutral,0.6280407309532166
6D BANNED BOOKS including a dictionary is of course up-to-the-minute news.  And 13A Butt-dials? may be an early contender for Clue Of The Year.,8,neutral,0.7024201154708862
"I don‚Äôt think the clue for 17A is particularly accurate. Congestion and a runny nose are not mutually exclusive. For me, congestion is nearly if not always accompanied by a runny nose.",3,negative,0.7890494465827942
"I worked this one peripatetically, jumping all around the puzzle getting a word here, a letter there until it mostly came together.  But the pesky SW corner stubbornly refused to yield.  SINGTO and HUGGER had to be right, but because I had entered Ford for Futura instead of FONT and had spelled RAWR rowr I was bedeviled.  It took longer than I care to admit to see the error of my ways.  Some nice misdirections made for a good challenge.",15,neutral,0.4598647356033325
"A certain amount of crosswordese is to be expected, but ACER? RAWR? ATNO? INSP?  Really?",18,neutral,0.70063716173172
"Deb says:

47A. ‚ÄúOne who puts one past you‚Äù is a gifted tennis player, or an ACER. I‚Äôve heard the word ‚Äúace‚Äù used in this way, but ACER is new to me.

I'll agree that ACER is probably not used much as ""one who serves aces in tennis"" in the real world, and I don't think it's any dictionary, but it has been clued that way several times before, even though there's the computer company and the maple genus (used more often before the company was known here) to clue the word.

But although it's crosswordese royalty more than a commonly seen real-life word, ACER has been clued in some very punny ways in its tennis sense:

‚Ä¢ Expert service provider?
‚Ä¢ One providing great service?
‚Ä¢ A-1 tennis server
‚Ä¢ Serena Williams (or Pete Sampras), often
‚Ä¢ One-hit wonder?
‚Ä¢ One who has a quick point to make?
‚Ä¢ Hot server
‚Ä¢ One with a fastball?
‚Ä¢ One who gives special service?

And in its last appearance before the Shortz Era, something just a little different:

‚Ä¢ Very lucky golfer?

But the only clue that references both tennis and laptops was this one from last year:
‚Ä¢ Apt laptop choice for a tennis pro?

TL;DR:  If Will Shortz says it's a word, it's a word.",16,neutral,0.7541528940200806
"Vague or general clues to familiar kinds of answers meant a slow start turned into a fast finish. Once I found a few toeholds, the crosses cascaded into quick completion.",7,neutral,0.7228573560714722
"Tonight‚Äôs episode in Funny Wrong Answers:
‚ÄúCause of some buyer‚Äôs remorse‚Äù:
The buyers move into the new house, bring in all the boxes and furniture, go to open up a closet, and there they are! HIDDEN FEET!

Also wrong but maybe not as funny:
I first thought M-W and Waldo were simply BESTSELLERS.",41,negative,0.6507934331893921
"I was feeling like I wasn't on Hemant's wavelength at all--it felt like I was struggling to fill anything in--and then suddenly it was finished. So I guess I wasn't too far off. I liked things like SPOILED ROTTEN and SHOOK THINGS UP. Nice job!

And I agree with Steve L about the graying-out and freezing of the column while I look at comments. Very annoying.",22,neutral,0.4380548298358917
BOOTYCALLS is one of the best clued answers I've seen in a while,65,positive,0.9594368934631348
"Something new I'm noticing about the column and comment section that I'm not too fond of...

When I click open the comment section, the main part of the page is now grayed out, and I cannot scroll it up and down as before.  So every time I want to refer to the column while reading the comments, I have to close the comments and then reopen them.  When I go back to the comments, I'm at the top of them again, not where I was before.

This is new, and it is annoying.  Why don't the tech people fix the problems that are really problems, like the lack of an equals sign on the  iPhone app?  Or whether the first letter of a rebus will be accepted?",34,negative,0.7603718042373657
"Before we get into today's puzzle, I want to cut and paste a comment and my reply from late Thursday.  I assume that since I replied so late, few people saw it, which is why I'm repeating it.

If you haven't solved the Thursday puzzle yet, you'd best skip past the rest of this.  I'll leave some

Great puzzle ... very smart! But, afterward when I glanced over the grid, I asked myself: ""who on earth is Pia Noleg?"" Really... I was Dooked big time. Onto reading...

I replied:

@Bonnie Pia Noleg is the pirate's moll. Her nickname is Peg. Her sister is Mia Oneleg, but they call her Eileen.",21,neutral,0.8072298765182495
