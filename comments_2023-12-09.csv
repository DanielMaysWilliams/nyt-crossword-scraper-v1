Major, major hangup at BAT POLE (BAT cavE? BAT POsE?) and its juxtapositions with KOWTOW (I know the word and how to spell it, but thanks to its modern usage I kept looking for ‚Äúcop‚Äù in the first 3 letters), BOWMEN (nOrMaN? yeOMEN [with a rebus to fit??]?), and the curs√®d PEWIT.

PEWIT, in fact, was one of two lookups after passing the agonizing 1:45:00 mark.

"More than just a couple of lookups for me to ""solve""  this very well-constructed puzzle. The best I can do is to offer my take on it.

I noticed that some clues were repeated or nearly repeated? For instance, ""Safaris, e.g."" and ""Safari destinations""  or ""One pulling some strings"". and ""Toys with strings"". That took some thought, I imagine, for the constructor.

I kicked myself after not getting TABULA RASA on my own, knowing that the first letter was a T.

Looked up PEWIT to also discover a host of other names for this bird: peewit, tuit or tewit, green plover, (in Ireland and Great Britain) pyewipe, or just lapwing. God help us if any of these are used in subsequent puzzles! :-)

I thought the following clues were clever:
* ""Make advances"" (easy to have misinterpreted)
* ""100% correct!"" (deduced this by crossing, but, otherwise would never have guessed it)
* ""Spot check"" (so good!)
* ""Pillar of the superhero community"" (tricky)

The following answers were quite worthy:
* EMBIGGENS (made me smile)
* WHYNOTBOTH (fit very nicely with the clue)
* BOWMEN (one learns something new every day)
* DUCKEGG (don't recall having heard of this color before)
* CRAPO (was Ms. Iverson sneakily criticizing Congress - or was that just me?)
* CURSORY (wouldn't have guessed this without crossings, but the answer fits the clue)

In short: a great and difficult puzzle: excellent Saturday fare.

Most interesting thing about my solve:  I thought of ABROAD immediately -- with no crosses at all -- for the vaguely clued ""Not here"".  Which was later confirmed by the AB, at which point I thought, ""No, ABSENT is better"" -- so I changed it.  Which completely loused up my Northwest.

Also, when my mice run, they ScampER.  Which loused up my middle Far West. This kept me from seeing KOWTOWING; ATTEMPT; ANTONIO and HIT ME.

"Pardon my nerd-out to come, but today‚Äôs answer set is popping!  It‚Äôs electric, shimmering.  And I‚Äôd like to back this up.

XwordInfo makes a diagram for every NYT puzzle ‚Äì a colorized grid, where every debut answer is colored red, every answer that has appeared once in a NYT puzzle is orange, those that have appeared twice are yellow, three times green, and four blue.  Those that have appeared more than four times are gray.  Gray answers are stale, or on their way to stale.

My jaw dropped when I saw the diagram for today‚Äôs puzzle because there was so little gray ‚Äì I actually counted the gray squares ‚Äì 27% of the puzzle, meaning that 73% of the puzzle belongs to fresh answers, almost three-quarters!

Wow! That is one popping grid!  And even among the gray words were the lovely SKITTER, TABULA RASA, HIT ME, SERAPH, YOUR TURN, and CURSORY.  

EDGY indeed.  And that is before superb Saturday cluing, from witty to need-crosses-to-get.  Tangled and tough. 

What a gem!  Brava and bravo, Doug and Christina.  This was, for me, a sterling outing.  Thank you!",33,positive,0.9391568303108215
"I was pleased with myself remembering TABULARoSA, but disappointed when my last entry, a reasonable guess, BATPOLE, did not trigger the music.  I did not recall bat pole in the Batman mythology so I assumed my error was there.  Towmen, cowmen, rowmen all seemed possible, but did not help.  I did not know the Idaho senator so I wondered if my problem was there, that‚Äôs when I suspected RoSA might be RASA.  Even with flyspecking finished 22% faster than average.  Good Saturday puzzle.",7,negative,0.5715755820274353
"Well - all I had to do was ACT NATURALly. For me that meant a few googles early on and then... there was the southeast corner. Just a lot of pondering and considering crosses and... was more than a bit surprised to finish successfully.

Tough one, but in the end - enjoyable. 

Can't even remember what led me to my puzzle find today, but it was a quite interesting find - a Sunday from October 24, 2010. Some sample answers:

CRAPSSUZETTE

"This is my kind of Saturday.  It was hard to get a foothold for a while, then gradually sections began to fall.  I was stuck on YOURe out for the play ending words at 35A for a while, so I struggled more in the SE than I should have.  

I'd like to see more collaborations from these two.

"A fun puzzle requiring a wide range of knowledge.  Although an avid birder, I didn‚Äôt know the northern lapwing was also known as a pewit, although I think that term can be used generally for a class of birds in addition to the lapwing.  In any event this good sized plover has a long curved crest that makes it look both elegant and comical.

For UCSF, I entered SAN, ignoring the ‚Äúabbreviation‚Äù part of the clue. Changing that to CAL helped a lot. 

SNORKELED was a great clue/answer, and having it next to KOWTOWING was fun. The triple stack in the SE was a memorable one. A Latin phrase, 19th century formal dress, and a contemporary phrase made for a striking finish. 

Both LEM (‚ÄúThe Eagle has landed‚Äù) and EMBIGGENED stirred enjoyable memories of entirely different kinds.
