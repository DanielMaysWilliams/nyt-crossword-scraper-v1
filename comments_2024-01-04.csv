"This one made me smile too, and you are so right about all that, Deb. Sorry the puzzle and/or the format were frustrating for many folks. My version (app on my iPad) had parentheses, and I was working on the bottom part when the theme suddenly made sense to me. I woke up in a very low mood, and the puzzle definitely cheered me up, as did Deb’s commentary. I’m grateful for this pastime and for this community of puzzle people.",23,positive,0.7608972787857056

I always enjoy your columns! I'm with you about the emotional boost from those AHA moments while solving - and I often smile when I read similarities in your solving experience to mine. (Today it was PAGES. So great!!)

I would like to make a correction to a descriptor in today's Tricky Clues, though. I do it with some reticence given that you are also having to be the interlocutor for all the technology grief being expressed! But I feel it's an important enough distinction to persevere...

For 27D, you say that ATTA is ""used to make East Asian flatbreads such as roti, chapati and paratha.""  Atta is indeed used to make those delicious items, but the region from which they originate is *South* Asia, the cuisine which we broadly call Indian here in the States. Roti is also made in parts of Southeast Asia, but chapati and paratha do not have the same culinary reach - and certainly do not extend to East Asian menus!

I hope you don't need to resort to using a STRESS BALL after reading my comment (though you may already be ducking and running from this forum today!). May we break figurative bread together again over tomorrow's puzzle!",16,positive,0.9516141414642334

As long as you’re at it, why not annotate the 5 extra  theme clues that CI included in the constructor notes?  Space-wise, it’s a huge part of the constructor notes and trying to figure out the “answers” reminds me of the trouble I had sorting out the theme of the puzzle itself.",4,neutral,0.7994338274002075
