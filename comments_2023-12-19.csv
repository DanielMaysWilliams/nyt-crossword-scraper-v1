"Loved the puzzle, and the constructor's notes. If I were a first-time constructor I'm not sure I'd read Parker's take. I gather others don't appreciate his often negative tone and I tend to agree. I rarely read him, for the same reason, but since Seth suggested it, I did today.  Along with a lot of niggling criticism, he did have some nice things to say about this puzzle, including liking the entry RAZORCLAMS. As an avid forager with easy access to the beautiful Oregon Coast, I concur. They are delicious when floured, dipped in an egg wash, dredged in panko and lightly sauteed--nature's GROCERYLUST!

Little aside, I never leap to the association of hero sandwiches and delis. I think that must be an American thing. In Canada, a deli makes sandwiches involving cured meats but seldom uses the foot long bun associated with a hero: typically rye, multigrain, sourdough, white. In fact, we don’t generally refer to this sandwich form as a hero but instead call them subs. We find subs in sub shops like *Subway* or our homegrown *Mr. Sub*.

"Greetings from the disaster zone.

I wasn't going to post today -- no power and I wanted quickly do the puzzle and shut down to preserve battery life. But... CLAM! ""

I can't let a puzzle with a CLAM in it go by without praising it! 

We had 65-mph gusts on top of 45 mph winds. From my personal perspective, it was OK because the wind came from the S and SE, which puts me in the lee of the local geography. But there are trees and power lines down everywhere and Versant says it will take several days before powers restored everywhere. I've been out almost 24 hours now and it is probably I'll be out a lot longer than that, since I'm out in the sticks a bit. I do have a neighbor with a generator so I can recharge my batteries. I have 56V EGO tools and an EGO inverter, so I am keeping the fridge cold, but it eats up the batteries pretty quickly. 

Usually this time of year when there's an outage I can just put the fridge stuff outside and the frozen stuff stays frozen and the refrigerated stuff stays cold, and is moved inside to keep it from freezing. But it was 58F yesterday -- in Maine? In December?? It should cool down tonight, but in the meantime I'm eating up battery power keeping the food cold. 

We won't get into the flushing situation. 


I hope all the other Maine folks are OK.

"Why the Thanksgiving dinner ended early?

AUNT MISBEHAVIN’

Great revealer and the pins were finny.  Keep ‘em coming, Seth!",58,positive,0.7728334665298462
"Nice debut, Seth.

Hiatus is over; back to work!

And don't mind what Rex says.





Do read what the emus say",17,positive,0.8101747632026672
I'm relieved that the site finally let me in to do the puzzle. GROCERY LUST is what I sometimes feel while standing in front of the Ben and Jerry's ice cream in the freezer case. Nice debut!,21,positive,0.9585632085800171
"Just like last week, this felt surprisingly tricky for a Tuesday - but I really did enjoy it quite a lot! One of the rare occasions where instead of using the theme reveal to solve the theme clues, I had to get all the theme clues first and then solve the 'reveal' hint from there. It was pretty satisfying to figure it out, though.

I also felt that I got quite lucky - if I hadn't remembered LAILA Ali from a previous NYT crossword, I would've likely got stuck on that bottom section for way longer. 

Besides that... PITA and PISA so close together was fun, and as someone who enjoys puns, I did get quite a laugh out of the theme clues and figuring them out. A really solid debut, and I'm glad to have experienced it! Certainly looking forward to more.",18,positive,0.9608684182167053
I think I worked at a famous comedy theatre at the same time that Seth did and his sense of humor comes through nicely in this one. Great seeing a familiar name getting one in! Great theme and some nice offbeat cluing.,16,positive,0.9768494963645935
Cute theme! GROCERYLUST made me laugh. Can't say I was thrilled with EXED. That first E just feels wrong!,4,positive,0.8159003853797913
"Beyond the clever puzzle, charming constructor notes!

I look forward to hearing more from you, Seth Weitberg.",26,positive,0.9769402742385864
"Before getting to the revealer or enough theme answers to see what the pattern was, the clue for 37A (""Why the pizza over is so hard to clean?"") seemed perfect for a non-vowel-substituted answer; MOZZARELLA STICKS would itself have made a cute, punny answer. Alas, the final S would have been necessary, and there weren't enough spaces, so I had to look for another alternative.  (Putting the clue in the past tense might have been a little more in line with the crossword convention of tense agreement.)

But Seth, IF I WERE YOU, I'd look for a way to get that pun into some future crossword.",5,neutral,0.6270917654037476
