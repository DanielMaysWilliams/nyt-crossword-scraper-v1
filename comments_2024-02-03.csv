The SW corner dropped in super quick for me. The NE wasn‚Äôt so bad either. I needed the column for help with the rest. Both the clues and the answers felt vague for me which I guess is outside of my wheelhouse. I did love ROCKETSCIENCE and BRAINSURGERY and chuckled at BAAS.,2,positive,0.5719383955001831
"Oh no, Jeff Chen is advising newbies in his dark arts of crossword cruelty? Great. Saturdays are going to lose their weekend status!

Seriously, this was really good. I worked on it this morning, and got the SW corner but the rest looked like a scene from Fargo. Then a busy day, and just returned to it now. To my surprise, the reset did the trick, and while it wasn‚Äôt exactly a breeze I made traction and was able to finish it and come in below my daily average. Really, a terrific Saturday, challenging and satifsying, and congratulations to Carolyn  Davies Lynch on an outstanding debut, and Jeff Chen too!",4,positive,0.6026960611343384
"What a great debut!! I confess, Saturdays are the devilish combination of the toughest puzzles of the week on the day I have the least capacity to work on them -- so I usually mentally grit my teeth and try to push through. By contrast, while still super tough, today's was a joy! If I had to pick a favorite, the wordplay with ""Angular movement?"" takes the prize.

My comment today is so late to the game, I doubt many will see this -- but I'm quite surprised no one seems to have come away with the same earworm I did after filling in 40D! It would have played plenty on BBC RADIO back in the day ...

"As a sweeping generalization, I'm finding Saturdays are usually my least enjoyable puzzle day, though I still like to do with them because I want to keep getting better all around.

It felt more light-hearted! Maybe I just jived with it a little bit more, I'm not sure, but I enjoyed the clues and the spanners a lot! It felt very clean and light -- and approachable, despite its difficulty. 

Once I finally gave up on sleeper in the NW, I had only the SE, which was definitely a big struggle! I had ids instead of OKS, I regret to say that I've never heard of KUSH, had sedona instead of KIA RIO, tried pat on, rub in, etc... pretty much everything except DAB ON. Curses and swears instead of TIRADE. Yeah, it might not have been ROCKET SCIENCE or BRAIN SURGERY but that was a tough little corner for me! Still, I have zero cross words to say about it!

"I would suggest that the regular inclusion of clues involving marijuana, probably done at the behest of editors who have been instructed to pander to the supposed taste of the demographic that the paper's owners believe constitutes their primary audience, is both unnecessary and degrading. Unnecessary because habitual solvers will always prefer a clever construction to allusions to some supposedly trendy cultural signifier; degrading because it assumes a drug is a generational touchstone. Marijuana smokers, at least under the influence, are boring and stupid. Is that who NYT's publishers think their audience is? And why assume that of crossword solvers, of all people?

Hi Caitlin! I connect the term ""Hail Mary pass"" with the Notre Dame Fighting Irish (whose players were more likely to go on to join the K of C), and apparently it does stem from the 1930's. although, per Wikipedia, the first published use is in reference to a game between the OSU Buckeyes and the (Jesuit) Georgetown Hoyas.

Sophia before Gnosis--but just knowing things doesn't make one wise.

KUSH doesn't mean high THC. An alternate, accurate answer with that ""k"" would be Kine or Kind, which specifically means strong cannabis.

COMEINHOT was new to me and, not being a pub aficionado (I‚Äôm more of a cocktail guy), SOURBEERS just sounded like lots of green paint. And I was torn between ‚Äúolaf‚Äù and ‚Äúsven‚Äù (‚ÄúFrozen‚Äù anyone?) NILS wasn‚Äôt even on the radar. 

Thank goodness for IBID and MEH. Those led me to ‚Äî-FILM and I finally untangleled myself.",9,positive,0.652371346950531
"Terrific debut, Carolyn!  If Jeff had to step away from xwordifo to mentor people like you (and to work on his new game), I guess I can accept that loss.

For me, this wasn't quite as tough as Fridays, but it still put up a good struggle.  My insistence on idS over OKS at 39 A made the SE harder than it needed to be.  Once I gave up on that, things moved along.

I loved the duplicate clues and crossing of BRAIN SURGERY and ROCKET SCIENCE.  ""Victor's crow"" had me wondering if there was a literary character with a crow I was supposed to know, so when I got it, it felt like I WON.

"This puzzle was true evidence of YMMV. i filled in the SE first, but had a devil of a time with the NW, where I started. I was surprised to see how many common four letter Scandinavian first names there are, NILS, Lars Olaf, Olaf, Sven. I‚Äôm sure there are more if I dug deeper. What killed my time was the seemingly endless flyspecking before I realized that the early Kia was not an a RIa, and that STOKES worked better than STaKES for the cross.

"Nice - I did not need autocheck today, which is rare on a Saturday, and I only had to look up four trivia clues.

I actually realized Panthers related to a sports team, and given how long the answer was, and with no indication that it would be an acronym or familiar name, I guessed it would be just a regular state or city name, rather than some college, so I waited for a few crosses, and I got CAROLINA. That was quite an achievement for me, since American sports clues are usually the hardest ones for me in these puzzles. To not have to look one up feels great ü§©.

I ended up looking up ELKS LODGE - I got Lodge from crosses, but I had no idea what EL_S could be, and here the cross was not helping me. I also googled the composer, King Lear's daughter (Shakespeare is largely not included in highschool curricula over here - we only studied Macbeth and Hamlet, in Polish, obviously - and I am not a theatre afficionado) and TBS - I have never watched any American tv channels (I had better things to do when I was in the US on holiday, and most US tv channels are not available in Europe), and even though TBS often features in NYT puzzles, I have no idea what kind of channel it is.

I enjoyed the clueing, which was inventive and misleading enough without being obnoxiously arcane, and the fact trivia was limited to an absolute minimum. A brilliant puzzle, one of the most enjoyable Saturdays I have ever solved üëçüèæ.",46,positive,0.8885143399238586

"I can't use the saying ""It's not BRAIN SURGERY"" with my brother, the neurologist. 
I'm met with a roll of the eyes and a snarky ""You'd be amazed how easy BRAIN SURGERY actually is."" 
Having learned my lesson at long last, I now say ""It's not ROCKET SCIENCE"" and am now met with an entertained smile.

As for the puzzle, it felt like ROCKET SCIENCE in the NW, my last quadrant to fall, until ART came to me and I scrapped ""hanS"" as the common Scandinavian name. 
After that, it all fell into place, easy as BRAIN SURGERY.

"Congratulations on a fine NYT debut, Ms Lynch!

Like Caitlin, I found this one easy to get started, but more challenging towards the end. The SE corner in particular seemed to resist everything I tried there, even though my early guesses of DAB ON and IDLY turned out to be correct. Eventually, that odd-looking -IA- gave me KIA RIO, which led to KUSH (which I know only by name) and a splat of final answers. 

I enjoyed the pairing of ROCKET SCIENCE and BRAIN SURGERY. Those were once would-be theme entries in a puzzle I never made because I couldn‚Äôt think of any similar metaphors for smarts.

"Some thoughts based on yesterday's comments:

1. Lately, there have been quite a few people counting and criticizing the number of proper names in the puzzle.  Crosswords always have had proper names in them, and the ratio of proper names to other entries has never been lower.   In fact, in the olden days, many of those proper names were obscure rivers and other geographic features, names of species of plants and animals, etc.  Modern crosswords rely on more current proper names, and perhaps that's some people's problem.  They don't know them, and they'd rather have the obscure rivers, which they don't think of as proper names, since what they really mean is pop culture names. (See clue 1A, Day 1.  Then see 113A, 84D, 137D and 141D.) https://www.xwordinfo.com/PS?date=2/15/1942 ). 

I guarantee you, most people wouldn't.

2. Someone wisely said yesterday that ""What I know < what I don't know"".  However:

You can get to the point where what you know that will help you solve a crossword will be more than the number of answers you flat-out don't know until you get a slew of crosses.

For example, I flat-out didn't know SUNK COST FALLACY yesterday (although it seemed many others did).  But I did know enough cross answers that it all fell into place.  The puzzle favors the knowledgeable, but even the less knowledgeable can get there with enough practice.  But if you didn't know DOC MARTENS, TUCSON, TOTO and a few others because of your aversion to proper nouns, you won't get there.",16,neutral,0.664026141166687

"Not fair.  I don‚Äôt need another word game. 

Warning:  Don‚Äôt click on the Squeezy link.  I repeat, whatever you do, don‚Äôt click on the Jeff‚Äôs ‚Äúnew invention‚Äù link.  Who wants yet another addictive word game with a really cool concept, fun graphics and the satisfaction of Wordle and Connections combined upon completion.  Sure, Jeff‚Äôs a nice guy and all and he deserves a cool mil or two from the NYT for the rights to his *highly addictive* new game.  But don‚Äôt say you weren‚Äôt warned.

Puzzle was a delight.  For me, a lot like yesterday.  Felt harder than it ended up being.  Had to flyspeck because I carelessly filled in ASCENd instead of ASCENT and DEE (as in defense) seemed plausible, if awkward,  for ‚ÄúBall holder.‚Äù  Given Jeff‚Äôs antics in a puzzle a few years ago (hiding ‚Äúorgasm‚Äù in a diagonal string and then feigning innocence), once I had the SM at the end of what turned out to be CUBISM, I had to wonder if somehow ‚ÄúAngular movement‚Äù could describe that other . . . .

"I was cruising through this one until I got to the SE corner (the NW had a little bite, but not that much, mostly because I had EYE for ""Ball holder"" [TEE] and LARS for the Scandinavian name [NILS]).

In the SE, I had IDS for OKS (Licenses, perhaps) and STUNNER for SHYNESS (It may leave you speechless).  I knew KUSH, but wanted to spell it with a C, like the ancient African kingdom. I kneew 46D was going to be a car model, but I was thinking of longer make names like OPTIMA rather than KIA something.  Aside from DAB ON, the other across clues were just...vague.

Deciding that ELD... didn't look like the start of a club name, I reconsidered IDS, and once I realized that ""licenses"" in the clue was a verb, not a noun, I got OKS, and thus ELKS CLUB, and then everything else fell into place.
