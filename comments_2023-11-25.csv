I have a visceral reaction to the ""one square missing"" message, so I tried reasoning it out: ASTRA made the most sense. I took the leap and was rewarded with the music.

This solved faster than Friday. I always love it when the seemingly inscrutable spanners almost solve themselves with just a few crossings. Entries like 12A and 59A elicited a ""Is that it? Thought the answer might be more esoteric.""

"Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good. One piece of luck for me: I had just mentioned MILLIONMOMMARCH in a comment in the last few days as one result of a 15 letter answer search. Beyond that... I was stumped in more than a couple of places and just made my best guess here and there. I paused for a moment before filling in the last square - wondering how many wrong answers I'd have and if I'd be able to find them. And... nope - had it all correct and actually came in well below by Saturday average. Whew. 

Answer history search today was for SCRAMBLETHEJETS and that led to an interesting puzzle from Wednesday September 21, 2016. That answer was the reveal in that puzzle. The other theme answers (with the scrambled JETS set apart for clarity): 

rock ETJS quirrel
m ETSJ ersey
cour TJES ter
jule SETJ im

I'm done.

"I hope we get many more from you, Jeff!  I found it appropriately challenging but solvable even though the math prize fellow (gal?) and a few others were initially obscure to me.  My usual Saturday process prevailed--a few strolls through the As and Ds bore little fruit, but eventually it all emerged from the inner recesses of my aging brain.",11,positive,0.9530928730964661
"Got off to a good start, but struggled with (unusually?) many proper nouns. And as others have remarked, several entries seem a bit forced (EEEE, DNAS, ECRIME).

But very happy to see a reference to fellow Norwegian Niels Henrik ABEL. The Abel monument is just ten minutes from my home in Oslo, so that was a gimme for me, but probably a bit esoteric for many solvers.

A general question: Are the puzzles easier now than before? Every now and then I solve a puzzle from the archives. I‚Äôve recently been doing some puzzles from 2018, and they just seem a lot harder? Maybe it‚Äôs just a coincidence.",10,neutral,0.5411381125450134
"Aerospace nerd here - that ASTRA clue is probably within a month or two of needing to be written in the past tense. The company went public a couple years ago at a valuation of $2 billion, and earlier this month the founders proposed to take it back private at a valuation of just $28 million. Combination of going 2 out of 5 on launches (and the one they did for NASA failed), the end of the zero-interest rate economy, and SpaceX continuing to eat everyone's lunch (in this case with Transporter missions, where they'll throw a gaggle of smallsats into LEO for cheaper than Astra could, and more reliably).",27,neutral,0.782138466835022
"Really disliked much of this. I‚Äôve been going through the Saturday archives and this reminds me of some of the poorer ones from way back for a variety of reasons. 
From dubious plurals (DNAs??) repeated clues for crosswordese (mis, res), and just generally terrible non-word answers (EEEE, e-crimes). 
What broke my streak in the end though was the sheer volume of proper nouns in close proximity (no clue on Abel, Scotts, Astra - weird cluing on that last one, it‚Äôs not a hard enough get already?)

"Great clue, ""Olive lover"", though anyone, post women's liberation, viewing Popeye cartoons nowadays would hardly call that love.

Jeff Stillman's puzzle revealed to me the existence of the KOTO and Wikipedia filled in the details. I imagine that, since it is the national instrument of Japan, many solvers of today's puzzle were already familiar with the koto.

Although I enjoyed today's puzzle, I found few tricky clues; that's okay - I don't mind easier Saturday puzzles.",10,positive,0.6740226745605469

"I had everything but the Y in 1D, and my brain got stuck on parsing the final 7 letters as OUT HERE for the longest time.

"Jucundissimum cruciverbium pro NOBIS, Jeff Stillman. 

Sweet if quick, except for getting tripped up on parsing out the meaning of ‚Äî [embarrassed pause] ‚Äî E CRIME. 

As I made my way up from my customary SE starting corner, I had filled it in as ‚ÄúaCRIME,‚Äù which left the ‚ÄúSpanish Steps‚Äù requiring an answer ending in an ‚Äúa.‚Äù (Yes, I know the clue is, ‚ÄúSeries of steps in Spain,‚Äù not, ‚ÄúSpanish Steps.‚Äù I KNOW. But that‚Äôs not how my brain remembered it, and by the time I tried to fit the answer in, I had already got in a Latinate frame of mind with NOBIS.) So instead of FLAMENCO DANCE, I tried to fit in, ‚ÄúScalinata di Trinit√† dei Monti,‚Äù or what the Italians call the Spanish Steps in Rome. 

Sigh. 

Even after finishing the puzzle, I grumbled to myself: ‚ÄúWell. I‚Äôve never heard of referring to an E felony as an E CRIME. Pshaw.‚Äù

Yeah, because it isn‚Äôt. And A CRIME involving ransomware probably isn‚Äôt an E felony, Self. Good grief.",8,neutral,0.7688783407211304

"I am seriously proud of doing this, no lookups, in a shade over 40 minutes.  I had exactly one gimme on first go around and that turned out to be wrong.  (EttE instead of ENNE.). I also had a maybe at 25A which again was wrong: gods instead of ORBS.  OPEC was a guess at 52A which led to CHER although I had no idea what she was up to in 1976.  From there it flowed in fits and starts - the bottom half more easily than the top.  I thought I knew all the Peanuts characters but FRIEDA was a new one to me.

"My level of fatigue (or lack thereof) has returned more or less to normal after the past few days of preparation and then cleanup for Thanksgiving, and what a difference in solve times.  Whereas both Thursday and Friday's solve times came in around 30% higher than average, the Saturday solve came in at about 40% below average.  

That might seem to indicate that this was a relatively easy Saturday puzzle (at least for me), but I think that just as much, it means I'm finally over the exhaustion that the fourth Thursday in November brings to this household every year.  

But it's so much fun!  And there are so many leftovers!

Oh, yeah, the puzzle. I think that ABEL crossing ASTRA is borderline unfair, although I guessed the most likely letter, based on the notions that (a) it seemed like a vowel was needed there, and (b) ASTRA sounds like an aerospace company's name, and that ABEL is, well, a name.  Turns out it was the correct letter, and the alphabet run ended at a total of one.  (And of course, HAUER's R was a guess, too, since that's a name, as well.)

ALTON, Illinois, was another guess that had solid crosses.  KOTO, too.

With the CO in SCOTTS, I figured it was something with ECO.  In this case, it was literal green, though.
