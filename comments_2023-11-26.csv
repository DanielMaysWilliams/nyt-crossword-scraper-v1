"I just had a thought. 

I wonder is it would be possible for a constructor to create a section of the puzzle where OREO, OSLO, ONO, and ODO (the Star Trek shapeshifter) all intersect? 

I can create a mini-mini that looks like this:

OSLO
NEED
OREO

  But I don't see a good way to incorporate this section into a larger puzzle. 

Given the ubiquity of OREO, ONO, and OSLO in puzzles, I figure this is something that just has to be done. And maybe ODO deserves some crossword love, too. He always seemed very alone and lonely. 

Can you tell I'm a bit bored tonight?",3,neutral,0.6537625789642334

"Well, I finally finished! I liked this puzzle and it's theme though I agree it would have been nice if the cute theme answers both satisfied a clue or two parts of a clue. Still, really enjoyed it and got a kick out of many of the answers!

One thing I disliked was the clue for OVA in the SW. I'm on about my 110th puzzle or so but have seen OVA many times. This time the clue didn't set right with me: fertility lab supply. Full disclosure that this subject is very close to home for me and not in a happy way, but I guess I don't generally know OVA to be supplied by the fertility lab, though I suppose it's possible. I know many people who went that route to resolve their infertility and none of them had clinics that supplied the eggs. I have heard that some clinics do, so that's why I say I guess it's possible... I just don't think it's common. I could be wrong. Still, I think there could have been a lot cleverer ways to clue it, especially by these very clever constructors! Also, I'm certain that more experienced puzzlers just fill in ova as filler automatically for anything that is clearly fertility or reproduction based. And most people are not as sensitive as I am concerning the subject. 

Anyhow, fun puzzle! Cheers to a new week!",8,positive,0.9259634017944336
"As a child, growing up in the quaint Victorian town of Arcadia, Ohio--just a stone's throw from the bustling metropolis of San Daltan--my family and I lived in charming icosagon house--there had been a 19th. c fad for building these twenty-sided buildings.  It was a lovely place: Asters and dahlias bloomed by the front door.

"This puzzle present an opportunity for an edumicational moment. 

Ahem. 

When you come to Maine, please remember that our lovely coastal National Park is called ""ACADIA."" This is not to be confused with today's puzzle entry, ARCADIA. They are named for two completely different locations. 

ARCADIA refers to a Greek utopia, as alluded to in the clue to 5A. It also refers to a region of Greece. 

Although ACADIA is also considered by many to be a utopia, it is named not for the Greek ARCADIA, but for the region of downcast Maine and the Canadian Maritimes where the Acadians once lived, before Le Grand D√©rangement that began in 1755, when most Acadians were expelled, eventually resettling in Louisiana to give rise to our Cajuns.

If you come to Maine, please leave the R out of ACADIA. Even if you don't have a New England or Boston, accent, just omit the R. You will sound much better informed and more erudite if you do. 

(However, whether you ask for directions to ACADIA or ARCADIA, we will still tell you ""You can't get theyah from  heeyah."" And if you ask if you can ""take this road to ACADIA"" we're still gonna tell you ""that road's been there for over a hundred yeahs and you'd best just leave it where it is.""",13,positive,0.5797893404960632

FOOT

HAND (as in horse)

There are perhaps more, but that's all I can think of right now -- and it's not nearly enough to fill all the themer squares.

"I am surprised that so many people agreed with my perspective on the themed answers, but kindly permit me to be clear about the rest of the puzzle, because it certainly had other very positive merits in the cluing and the answers and it would be unfair to Adam Wagner and Michael Lieberman to fail to elaborate on these points:

* I was ignorant of the origins of the word ARCADIA - I'd deduced the answer, having heard the word multiple times.
Tom Stoppard's Arcadia, which I'd read some time ago (and which required much from its readers) came to mind.
I appreciated the lesson provided by Adam and Michael. One trait of a good puzzle is that it teaches and, for me, this puzzle taught.

* I loved the answer SBARRO. Such answers challenge the solver. When one encounters SB-------, one is sure to question oneself.

* BEANIES made me smile as did DISCOBRA.

* NYASA: a name for a lake in Africa. I'd never heard of this lake before. After checking with Wikipedia, the word Nyasa actually has four different meanings. Thanks to the constructors for, again, teaching me.

* I was unaware that Dahlias were native to Mexico.

* Loved ICOSAGON. I knew that an icosahedron is a 20-faced platonic solid (with each face an equilateral triangle), but I never came across the word for a 20-sided polygon. Given my training in mathematics, I should have known this. Again, another thing I learned from this puzzle.

* ""Most mountainous Caribbean nation""? Didn't know that about HAITI.

I don't mean to detract from the obvious hard work that went into its construction, but I did not particularly cotton to the gimmick behind this puzzle. It seemed to lack a certain coherence.

Take, for instance, ""ENDLESSLO(INCH)OPS: ""endless loops"" was completely semantically detached from ""endless loin chops"", didn't relate to anything else in the puzzle, and, frankly, did not spark many neurons, at least for me. That was the case for most of the seven themed answers, though I will say that BALLER(INCH)INA was cute.

Where are we going?""

Autumn Song
                                                   -- W. H. Auden

    Now the leaves are falling fast,
    Nurse's flowers will not last;
    Nurses to the graves are gone,
    And the prams go rolling on.

    Whispering neighbours, left and right,
    Pluck us from the real delight;
    And the active hands must freeze
    Lonely on the separate knees.

    Dead in hundreds at the back
    Follow wooden in our track,
    Arms raised stiffly to reprove
    In false attitudes of love.

    Starving through the leafless wood
    Trolls run scolding for their food;
    And the nightingale is dumb,
    And the angel will not come.

    Cold, impossible, ahead
    Lifts the mountain's lovely head
    Whose white waterfall could bless
    Travellers in their last distress.

"Relieved to report that my three-day streak of finding these puzzles unusually difficult (both by my own standards and compared to the reported experiences of others) is over, since I was seriously starting to wonder if I‚Äôd had some kind of brain event. Did this one seven minutes faster than Saturday‚Äôs. I‚Äôm chalking it up to holiday distraction.",10,positive,0.4517510235309601
"Not a cinch, had a bit of a struggle in the NW, did I know Rubik‚Äôs given name, err no I didn‚Äôt. 

Very fun.",6,positive,0.4582040011882782
"My friend constructs miniature mosaics. Just give him an inch and he'll make a tile.

"What a puzzle!  If you didn't get it in one direction you almost always would in the other, but that's not to say it was easy.  Required some double think of the best kind, and I had a lovely time working it.  

Thank you so much, Adam and Michael.  I needed to unwind and this was the perfect way to do it.",5,positive,0.9511828422546387
"Hi Caitlin,

I'm curious about ""future performance in 1951"" 
in the caption on your lead (lede) photo. 

My photo research suggests the unnamed person 
on the right is William Collier Sr., who died in 1944.

"Between the two of us we have worked as many kinds of teachers, at all levels, but since one of us is at heart a children's librarian - we found ourselves spending an afternoon at the Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art in Amhearst, MA a few years ago.  If you haven't had a look lately, picture books have gotten very sophisticated and cover a wide variety of subjects using both words and art.  
It is never too early for someone to start a love affair with books and at this museum you can both reminisce and fall in love with books all over again.
Well worth a detour:

"Like Caitlin, I noticed CHILLAXING in 30D. 

To me, this entry therefore could also have been clued as ""Meditation strategy?""

CHI 'N CHILLAXING

Fun Sunday puzzle, Adam and Michael.",5,neutral,0.726911187171936
"After these last few days my pants are a cINCH too tight, but this puzzle fit just right.  

Update on my lone goose friend from my golf course.  Not spotted this morning.  Of course, I may just have missed it, but I‚Äôm envisioning it flying over Paterson New Jersey with a new crew and possibly even a new mate.  (After posting the other day, I searched about why a goose might be alone, and one reason given is that geese mate for life and if they lose their mate, it can take a while before they‚Äôre ready to join a new flock and find a new mate).",26,neutral,0.45948338508605957
"What fun dookiness! Even after I figured out what was going on, I had to parse the theme answers (and their partner unclued words) practically letter by letter.

The best one is the CHINCHILLA XING with the little critters CHILLAXING with a Pisco Sour in the park next to the crosswalk.

"Cute theme, and fun puzzle overall.  LICIT always strikes me as being shy a prefix.  Sort of like whelmed, without either ‚Äòover‚Äô or ‚Äòunder‚Äô in front. 

Did anyone else immediately drop in ‚ÄúIch bin‚Äù at 104D for the start of the Kennedy quote?  üòÜ 

Thanks for a nice, slightly oversized Sunday, Adam and Michael!",10,positive,0.9079399704933167

"Just a quick note of thanks to Will Shortz & the whole WordPlay crew.

Over the long holiday my sense of timing gets bent out of wack, but the daily Xword is an island of consistency that keeps me centered.

"This is the kind of theme where some of us 
would like to see both versions of the themer 
mentioned in the clue ... and for past puzzles 
some posters have come up with doozies.

13D in this one could almost be imagined 
as a clue for both versions.

Was this puzzle the ""Seven Inch Year?""",13,neutral,0.7595751285552979
