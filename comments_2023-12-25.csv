"I've been falling behind (might not keep solving past Wednesday or Thursday much longer, though then I'm like the people who complain about the lack of a Christmas-themed puzzle despite one running Sunday) so I'm going to use this comment to talk about the last few days' worth of puzzles.

I had Thursday's puzzle filled but needed autocheck to see that STAnd for 38A was incorrect (7D and 35D didn't look right but I wasn't sure what was wrong with them). (In contrast to @kilaueabart, once I saw that CHI was the Greek letter that looked like an X I instantly realized that the clues to the themed answers were ignoring the shaded squares, but that's the only part of the theme I got on my own.)

On Friday I figured the misdirection going on with 1A's clue but initially thought it was going to be ""Bible"". After looking up *Rendezvous with Rama* I confidently filled in spaceSHIP for 29A only for several crosses to make that unlikely (especially 21D), but stuck with it until the column directly contradicted it (and initially put ""lic"" for 24D as a different approach to the same misdirection the entry was actually going for). 2D puzzled me; THEIR was too long, ITS too short, after learning what 1A was I thought it might be OurS but backed off of that when it meant two straight Us and three straight vowels at the start of 14A (which also made me doubt TUNA for 1D) and then autocheck confirmed it was wrong. Autocheck also surprised me when HARD REboot for 52A was marked wrong.",0,negative,0.5273752808570862

"Although a delightful theme, a few problems in this puzzle in my view (especially for a Monday):
24 across - so outdated it‚Äôs striking it was thought appropriate for a Monday
34 across - isn‚Äôt the ‚ÄúMideast‚Äù more generally a term applied to your states in the middle? The clue would have better pointed us to the answer by referring to the term more generally understood, ‚ÄúMiddle East‚Äù.
6 down - almost an antonym for harmony.

There‚Äôs Deb at the helm with humor to spare,

Speaking of puns, Mike gives two a day,

CLM‚Äôs alternate themers sing, as does her wit,
While John Ezra elucidates through jazz-inflected riffs,
Sam Lyons is both erudite and goofy, 
in the best way, like a scholarly I Love Lucy.
Then there‚Äôs the wise pro who goes by Newbie,
An old soul with street cred, and maybe a doobie,
Bill from Yokohama‚Äôs got one (or two) lit,
While sotto voce needs only the spirit to uplift.
Coloradoz (by way of Iowa) is still going strong
While dutchiris delights in puns, Warriors and song,

"Merry Christmas to all!

Hope you enjoy one of my favorite Billy Collins poems:

The first thing I heard this morning
was a rapid flapping sound, soft, insistent‚Äî

wings against glass as it turned out
downstairs when I saw the small bird
rioting in the frame of a high window,
trying to hurl itself through
the enigma of glass into the spacious light.

Then a noise in the throat of the cat
who was hunkered on the rug
told me how the bird had gotten inside,
carried in the cold night
through the flap of a basement door,
and later released from the soft grip of teeth.

On a chair, I trapped its pulsations
in a shirt and got it to the door,
so weightless it seemed
to have vanished into the nest of cloth.

But outside, when I uncupped my hands,
it burst into its element,
dipping over the dormant garden
in a spasm of wingbeats
then disappeared over a row of tall hemlocks.
For the rest of the day,
I could feel its wild thrumming
against my palms as I wondered about
the hours it must have spent
pent in the shadows of that room,
hidden in the spiky branches
of our decorated tree, breathing there
among the metallic angels, ceramic apples, stars of yarn,
its eyes open, like mine as I lie in bed tonight
picturing this rare, lucky sparrow
tucked into a holly bush now,
a light snow tumbling through the windless dark.

It was controversial at the time, because it dealt with the loss of a young woman's virginity, and was passed on by several artists.   

Looking back, it was one of the best introspective songs about this subject I've ever heard.  It won Song of the Year at the CMAs in 1997.  Many of you may have missed it because of differing tastes in music, but this one is definitely worth a listen:

"Thank you for the fun Monday puzzle, Amie. It was a nice after-dinner piece of solitude while the family holiday maelstrom swirled around me. Your mother would have been thrilled!",19,positive,0.9841609597206116
"Congratulations, Ms. Walker, on your successful and charming first NYT‚Äôs crossword puzzle‚Äîthe first of many, I hope. 
Maybe someday: a Friday puzzle!
Best regards",12,positive,0.9840307235717773
"I loved this puzzle! It wasn‚Äôt a slam dunk, which made it totally fun for a Monday. But once I got the ‚Äúberry‚Äù theme it went pretty fast. Thanks Amie for a great puzzle.",7,positive,0.9854674935340881

"""So beginning the day with a spread-out newspaper ‚Äî or, er, phone ‚Äî a cozy beverage, some music and nothing on the agenda but a little thinking? That‚Äôs the meaning of Christmas, as far as I‚Äôm concerned.""

Sounds like someone without kids, grandkids, or pets.
Those of us here have your collumn on our agenda. 
Enjoy the day.  God rest ye merry.",11,positive,0.706986665725708
"When I ground to a dead stop, I was dismayed. There it was, a big splotch of white over in the middle eastern region of the puzzle, and on a Monday no less.

The problem, of course, was my own ignorance of popular culture. That's my personal decision -- there are vast areas of artistry, including music and literature, which engage me with joy, and then there are others which I choose to eschew.

The stack of 28A, 35A, 39A, 45A, and 46A fell totally within that category. Obviously the fruit was gettable from crosses; what followed the fruit was, for me, insufficiently clarified by the corresponding down clues. I can't remember how many decades it's been since I failed to complete a Monday. That day has come.",11,negative,0.7182000875473022
"Ha! I found my thrill on blueberry hill.

Though we're apart
You're part of me still
For you were my thrill
On Blueberry Hill

***

He met Marmalade down in old Moulin Rouge
Struttin' her stuff on the street
She said, ""Hello, hey Joe, you wanna give it a go?""
Oh, uh-huh

***

There's just no getting through
Without you
A bottle of rouge
Just me and you
1982
Just me and you
There's just no getting through
The grape juice blues

***

He lived by the apple orchard in this little old orchard shack
His real name was Jackson Taylor, but I called him Apple Jack
Now old Apple Jack was loved by everyone he ever knew
Apple Jack picked apples, but he picked the banjo too

***

Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me
Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever

Have a good Xmas, all who celebrate it. Life sure is sweet when you're doing a fun xword puzzle, let's spread the love and preserve the traditions!",40,positive,0.7474332451820374
"Today I learned the difference between a ‚Äúnoob‚Äù and a ‚ÄúNEWB‚Äù but a Monday puzzle shouldn‚Äôt have tricky things like works with multiple spellings like that, especially when paired with ‚ÄúAWW‚Äù which is just ridiculous crossword-ese.",1,negative,0.5634244680404663
"A charming puzzle to find under the tree.

Thanks, Amie,

and congratulations 
on your NYT debut.
