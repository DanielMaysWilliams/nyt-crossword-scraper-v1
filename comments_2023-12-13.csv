"Fellow commenters--

1. If you're going to make a correction confidently, make sure your correction is actually correct.  Today might be a record for most erroneous ""corrections"" ever.

2. Read the column and the comments before offering your correction.  At the least, you might find out that the correction has already been offered, perhaps multiple times.  At the most, you might find out why your objection is actually wrong.

3. Develop an understanding of crossword cluing conventions.  ""Capital of Italy"" is a fine clue for EURO.  EURO has also been clued with ""Capital of Latvia"" (note the capital city is RIGA, also four letters like EURO and ROME), ""Overseas capital"", ""Continental capital""; similarly, LIRA (also four letters) has been clued as ""Former European capital"", and PESO as ""Mexican capital.""  

With regard to the VEIN clue, keep in mind that what comes to mind first isn't always the answer.  The VEIN is a ""pathway for oxygenation"" BECAUSE the blood in it is deoxygenized.

As for the BREWERY clue: BREWERIES don't make beer barrels, but they do make barrels of beer.  That makes the clue fine.  It's lateral thinking.  A similar clue might be ""Place to make a good case"".

4. If you find two, three or more errors, it's almost certain that it's not the puzzle's fault.  Think before you criticize.  And do a little bit of Googling, too.

I'm connected enough to the tech scene that 24A was my second themer to get and only because I was working my way down the Acrosses. The others I only got because I'd caught on to the theme, even 47A which I've watched enough televised poker you'd think I'd be able to get on my own.

I am the first person to complain about inaccurate and lazy clueing, like Monday’s answer of keg being a beer dispenser instead of a beer container (you need a “Tap” to dispense beer from the keg which holds the beer). But the complaining about vein is ridiculous. The clue doesn’t say “it brings oxygen to the heart”, which is what it seems some commenters must have read.

It's called deliberate ambiguity, folks. Not ""The pathway"" or ""A pathway"" just ""Pathway."" Fewer descriptors leave the answer up to interpretation, making a Wednesday entry slightly harder, but not impenetrable, as in a Saturday puzzle.

On a related note; ""Barrel maker"" for BREWERY. Again, minimal descriptors in the clue, leaving the answer up to interpretation. I drink a lot of beer, and have even brewed some, but I've never made a barrel. That doesn't mean that no brewer has ever made one. In fact, most of them probably made their own, before metal kegs became the norm.

By then I had the OCEAN; the VAPOR (There's such a thing as VAPORWARE??), CLOUD (I'd much rather be on CLOUD NINE than in Hog Heaven, to tell you the truth); the RAIN; and the RIVER.  I was looking for CONDENSATION as the revealer.  Or maybe a revealer containing the word MIST. 

Is going from OCEAN to RIVER, via VAPOR, CLOUD and RAIN, really a WATER CYCLE?

Counting both white AND black keys is why those confusing web sites told you a major ""third"" was 5 half steps. Yes it is. And if you start on ANY key and count 5 half steps you will have another third. if you start on a C sharp(black key to right of C) and count 5 half steps, you will be on white key F. if you start on a D (white after C) and count 5 half steps you will be on F sharp (black to right of F)

start anywhere on keyboard as your ""do"". Go 2 half steps (one ""whole step"") to re; 2 half steps to mi; 1 half step to fa; 2 half to sol; 2 half to la; 2 half to ti; 1 half to do.
  Now the fascinating question to me is WHY that design seems right? The fact that an octave  sounds equivalent clearly has a physical reality. But are the 12 steps ""real"" or convention? Just Western music tradition?  (There are lots of other systems including a minor scale.) The Greeks came up with several scales. One website suggests that the 12 tones are physical realities and that the major scale sounds nice  because it is mostly 2 half step intervals (or whole step intervals) with the two necessary 1 half step intervals (to end with the ""same"" note you started on but an octave higher)  as far apart as possible.",1,neutral,0.8507705926895142

I see why Googling the musical term ""third"" was  no help! But it is easy to understand if you have access to a piano or a keyboard. I hope you do; otherwise this won't help either.
 Start on any C, which is a white key to the left of 2 black keys (not a white to the left of 3 black keys). If you play the whites starting on a C and going right, you have a standard major scale do re mi fa sol la ti do (which you remember from school). It is also CDEFGABC. A major third is 1st & 3rd (do mi  or C E) A major fifth is 1st & 5th (do sol or C G)
An octave (8) is the white key jump  of 8 keys. Any C to the next C, but also any other white key such as D to the next D. Two notes an octave apart sound equivalent.
   Now where it gets fancy is if you factor in the black keys. The interval between any 2 adjacent keys is a ""half step"". if you play all 12 keys from one C to the next C that is a chromatic scale. (Actually all 12 starting on ANY key is a chromatic scale.)",3,neutral,0.7163300514221191

My brother and husband are avid poker players (husband is on his way home from Vegas as we speak), so I've heard a lot and learned a lot.

Anyway, TY dear constructor.  See you soon?",7,positive,0.9666256904602051
"I’m a bit surprised that neither Sam’s column nor, as far as I could see, any of the postings, questioned the source of the term “hog’s heaven”.  I never heard the term used before.  Google tells me this:

“There's no official explanation for the origin of the term. The Merriam Webster folks say it's American and the first print reference dates to 1945. But in 1871 the founders of the town that would become Moscow, Idaho, named their patch of land Hog Heaven, Idaho. So the concept of porcine euphoria is older than '45.”

(Of course, I’m not sure who is entitled to the claim to have “the official explanation” of any term. )

The only thought I had was that perhaps it was a reference to the perfect weather and road conditions for a Harley Davidson rider.

That said, having solved the puzzle, I will consider my consternation with that particular  clue to be water under the bridge.",6,neutral,0.5588129162788391

"Why was BREWERY clued as a barrel maker? These days no brewery uses barrels, and in the past breweries purchased barrels from coopers.

In general I personally found the SW corner hard and needed to look up a few things there. I have never seen The Waltons, CMERE I get but would never come up with, I know very little about poker, and not being a prude I don't associate ancient statues offhand with nudity. I've heard of MINUET but I have no idea what 3/4 time means so the clue did nothing for me.

I also had to look up some trivia elsewhere (but the Avatar/Avon crossing was no problem for me).

Capital of Italy... I know crossword clues often misdirect, and that's fine if they do so wittily, but this was just misdirection for its own sake and I did not enjoy it much.

This was not one of my favorite puzzles.",10,negative,0.6192088723182678

"Well, it definitely felt like perhaps today's and yesterday's Xwords should be switched for me in terms of difficulty! I did rather enjoy it, and quite breezed along through it with the smooth cluing and rather straightforward theme. I do vaguely recall seeing a similar theme before, but that's hardly a problem - there are so many crosswords, and as long as it's executed well (and it rather was, in this case) then I can't and won't complain.

The 'capital of Italy > EURO' clue isn't an original one either, but it never fails to make me groan and laugh, because I do admit I fall for the misdirection every single time. I also quite enjoyed PSALTER as well, which threw me off initially (I was thinking of PSALMS, but that didn't fit).",5,positive,0.9148454070091248

"WRT 30 across... this is likely *not* anatomically / physiologically correct...  

""Veins"" (as commonly used, meaning veins in the systemic circulation) carry relatively deoxygenated blood away from tissues and back to the heart --> right atrium --> right ventricle --> pulmonary arteries -->  pulmonary circulation (where the blood becomes more oxygenated - it picks up O2 in the lungs) --> pulmonary veins (the only way ""vein"" could really work for this clue) --> heart --> left atrium --> left ventricle --> systemic circulation.  That relatively oxygenated blood from the left ventricle is then carried to tissues via arteries and arterioles.",6,neutral,0.6498590707778931

"Clever theme. I like how Ocean Spray mixed with nearby Psalter has a saltwater echo. And that there were several other references to liquids and their flow: vein, ADE (first I filled in AGE for BLOCKAGE, which when you get to a certain age can become an issue with certain, ahem, cycles), levee, Tab (a zero calory soda whose popularity is on the wane), oar, rip (as in riptide), frappe (yuck), bar, perhaps eel, brewery, and the river Avon, so central to Shakespeare country. Hags might be one of those words that has not aged well, and I'm wondering if it is CRINGE-worthy, but as you know they're toiling over a boiling cauldron, another use of liquid. 

And what do you know! I was drinking a big glass of unsweetened Ocean Spray with a liberal amount of ice cubes, a spritz of seltzer & a generous wedge of lime, as I did this puzzle. Didn't know the company was a co-op; apparently over 700 farms across the country, particularly in New England, are part of it, employing thousands of pickers, sorters & processors for the bogs. I remember visiting one with a friend from Onset, MA: the one we went to was mainly worked by Cape Verdeans, some 3rd & 4th generation, and that this was quite usual up & down the NE coast. That was 30 years ago. 

As noted in the column, a psalter is really a collection of psalms, not hymns. There is a real difference. I suppose it's acceptable in Crosslandia but in the Real World I would never conflate the two. But the Shortz is my shepherd; I shall not want.",25,neutral,0.5414405465126038
