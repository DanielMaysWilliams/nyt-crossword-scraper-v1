"Sam tosses a lifesaver or two
Even if we need just a few
To keep a streak going
And stop to-and-fro-ing
It's Sam who comes up with some glue

On days when I'm almost in tears
And my brain has jammed up its gears
Sam knows what I suffer
She steps in with a buffer
And the muddle quite magically clears

All this is so gracefully nestled
In all those hard clues that I wrestled
I don't feel a dope
For forgetting a pope
Or not know that some trains are trestled

The choruses of praise are deserved
For saving us when we're unnerved
And for doing it all with writing
That's funny and exciting
And never pedantic or condescending or know-it-all, and certainly never hinting that we were dummies not to get it when she just breezed through the whole darned puzzle, brainier than we are and rubbing it in, but instead providing a beautifully written guide to how she arrived at the solve, knowing that some of us didn't need any help and some of us did, but cares so much that she's always warm and entertaining.  

Thank you, Sam, for a job that is so perfectly well done.",13,positive,0.48795652389526367

But if we have lunch, Adam, I won't order a BARBACOA.  I never order ""mystery meat"" and BARBACOA is certainly a mystery to me.  I wanted BARBeCue there and it just didn't work.

"Jeff Chen used to talk about Cruciverba, the crossword goddess, who, when things fell into place when constructing a puzzle, was smiling down at you, and who, when they didn’t, was bringing her wrath upon you.

After reading your notes, Adam, it sounds like she was smiling at you big time, providing a theme answer set that worked beautifully (when so often this is the point where a theme idea dies), and I saw more as well.  This is a grid filled with clean answers, and some lovely ones, including RELIC, TAPIR, SMITE, and TIPTOES.  

She also popped a couple of sweet question-mark clues into your brain – [Wild couple’s cruise?] for NOAH’S ARK, and [What might catch X’s at an O’s game?] for KISSCAM.

I’m grateful for learning a new meaning for FRY, for learning a culinary term in BARBACOA (a style of cooking meat), and for the scintillating PuzzPair© of BIG BIRD and EAGLE.

Sam Corbin, happy one year anniversary. It both feels (to me) like you just got here and that you've been here forever. You made yourself at home, quickly and quietly established your unique voice and wit, and you work so naturally with Deb and Caitlin, both of whom have their own voices and talents, that it seems like peanut butter and chocolate to me. Anyway, I hope the folks at the Times gave you a nice bottle of Canadian ice wine or a crossword themed sweater or something. I'll probably never file my taxes again without thinking, ""On this day, Sam Corbin came to work at the New York Times.""",48,positive,0.951835572719574
"Remembered why I don't do these at night. Mind really short circuited for a while. I got there under average, but this felt like it should have been faster.

Anyway, love the revealer. Even as a man, there are too many man babies. If you would like a fun song about men being terrible, dial up ""drone"" by Chastity Belt in your streaming service of choice (unless you own the album and then we should talk about Live Laugh Love).",7,negative,0.586915910243988
"Really did not appreciate how BIKINI was clued. Some people at the NYT specifically, and society generally, criticize women for wearing them, and criticize women for not wearing them. Plus, the clue once again reduces a woman’s participation in a (very, very challenging) sport to her body/clothes/potential lack thereof. 

This clue does not exist in a vacuum and should have been identified as imprudent at best, overtly sexist at worst, way before publication. Will not be supporting Mr. Fagliano moving forward unless something significant changes.",1,negative,0.8717999458312988
"This was a fine, breezy Tuesday puzzle.  I could quibble that the starred clues gave more information than was strictly necessary,  but I won’t because I thought the concept  of including persons whose last names were also immature animals was clever enough.  And I was amused to see CHARLESLAMB make a full fledged appearance in the puzzle after appearing so many times under his pseudonym.",21,positive,0.8945500254631042
"Dagnabbit, my car has tyres and a boot, but I automatically assumed we were discussing an American auto …. Spent far too long trying to figure out where the correction was necessary in the obviously incorrect BARBACOA before I backed off and guessed that Mr Gosling didn’t have a South African Mouseketeer cousin called Rian 🤦🏻‍♀️",30,neutral,0.48256051540374756
Glad to see we got a full dose of man-hating feminism in today's puzzle!,7,positive,0.8446995615959167
