"Off the beaten path - today's Connections puzzle (spoiler alert):

I learned about the concept of the ""uncanny valley"". 

After having read about it a bit. I'm not sure if this set of ideas is BS or is something to be investigated further. I need to read further, but I'm skeptical.

Anybody have thoughts on this subject?",1,neutral,0.6003677845001221

"@Mean Old Lady Oo I tried Thurdsay August 29, 2013! Aftrr about 43’ I decided to check puzzle and I had some of it but couldn’t figure out why Andre Agassi, Hurricane Carter or Katrina(and the Waves I looked up) were wrong. Got a handle from looking up where Pat Nixon was born and I loved the forward theme in the grid a lot! Time travel. I never would’ve gotten it without checking the puzzle bit by bit! It must’ve been hard to make. By Timothy Polin. Thanks for the fun suggestion!",2,neutral,0.535297691822052

"Being new to this, I've not had the pleasure of doing any of Mr. Steinberg's puzzles but I look forward to finding him in the archives. (I just started working on January 2023 and have done a few from the way back days of the archives.) 

Anyhow, this was lovely! It felt very hard but yet I somewhat quickly had all of the right side and the lower middle. I struggled more on the left and top middle. Eventually, because though I'd gotten the revealer clues, I didn't really get the theme, I had to trust in my crosses and that it's a tricky Thursday puzzle. When I entered my last box (the T in 1A) I got the happy music! Not a single error and not a single lookup. I'm amazed! It was under my average time and just over my personal best.

The biggest thing, though, is that - even though I feel silly for not getting the theme until I read the column - it all made me smile! Every lovely curveball! I especially loved 53A - Brown in strips! (My first thought was actually bacon, but that doesn't fit, of course.) I might have squealed with joy a bit when I confidently entered CHARLIE. :-)",10,positive,0.8802071213722229

"Oh, the pitapat of my one-chambered heart when I saw the clue for 1A and noticed it was four letters... I was *sure* the correct answer would be ""capT"". I even had the TOT for a confirming cross. 

ALAS, capT quickly fell. I guess it is too much to hope for.

Anyway, this clam is clammed up in his cabin in the woods of Maine, still without power (since Sunday). Late yesterday, I saw arborists on the road out to here, just beginning to remove all the large trees that are blocking the road and pinning the wires to the ground. I assume once they are through removing the lumber that the linemen will show up and do their thing. 

Versant says it might not happen until after Christmas, so there's that. 

I have EGO tools and I've run an extension cord to my neighbor's generator, so I can charge the EGO batteries. I have an inverter that has enough oomph to run the refrigerator and the power means I can charge the batteries.. The inverter also keeps my devices charged and I use it to run a light so I can read -- and complete NYT puzzles. 

I wonder how many flushes before the septic backs up? Being on a lake, I have to have a septic pump, and that needs electricity. (I also get buckets of water from my Very Good Neighbor.)

"When I read that David Steinberg was going to stop constructing puzzles, I teared up as I would at the loss of a dear friend.  His puzzles WERE dear friends; when I saw his name on one I leaped for joy inside, knowing it would be a piece of beauty.  It would have superb cluing, be scrubbed of junk, and if it had a theme it would wow me – every time.

Let me say something else about David that I know from experience.  He is a superb editor, actually working WITH the puzzlemaker, allowing everything he can that is submitted, and when he has to make changes, they always make the puzzle better.  Even more importantly than that, he is a mensch – kind, good listener, always in your corner, supportive.  

David, while I will miss your sublime creations, my sadness is easily outweighed by my respect for you and the smiles in my heart that have come from my interactions with you.  Thank you for making my world, and I’m sure the world of many, a sweeter place, for so many years.",29,positive,0.8768719434738159

You will jackknife out of bed, grab a notepad, and scribble furiously.  The next day you will do your day job conscientiously and with all the required commitment, but you will be champing at the bit for the workday to be over so you can get back to your puzzle idea to polish and complete it.

You have the devious and inventive  mind of a born crossword puzzle creator, David, and I doubt you'll be able to walk away from it entirely.  Even if you want to:)",28,positive,0.8745061755180359

"When I opened the puzzle and saw David’s name, I knew there was a scenic drive ahead. And there was, such as we have all come here hoping to find. David Steinberg has earned a place among the few constructors incapable of duds.

I did put it away overnight, because I couldn’t think of another string before Q, even after deleting MNOP and re-entering it several times,  that corner was opaque last night.

LMNOP reminded me of the children’s book where “what’s elemeno? you know, like an elemeno P?” is asked. English only has “double-u” for a descriptive letter name paralleling Spanish i-griega (Greek i), Polish ó zamknięte (closed u), Russian i-kratkoye (short i), Greek omicron (small o) and many more such letter names.

Ah, but then to read the constructor’s notes. Sigh. Sic transit gloria mundi. Or maybe more like Bilbo Baggins said: “I think I’m quite ready for another adventure!” All the best, David. You are a gifted person who has freely given gifts to all of us.

LAMBASTE, GROUPHUG and GLASSEYES are interesting entries---as opposed to GLAREAT, CRATEUP and a bunch of other dreck.

Kept an eye on the shaded squares, and having completed 5D and 7D, saw FI/LAMENTS and INFER/TILE, and was able to complete the ends of 52D RE and 53D NO. 

That pretty much allowed me to finish the rest of the puzzle quickly. Some wonderfully interlocking misdirects--Henry Su has talked about them below, but it is worth repeating that 46A, 50A and 53A are a delightful combination.

That said, I did try PST (Pacific Std Time) for the ""Wash. setting"" and MNOP for 1A.  Plus I whipped SAILS into 27A for ""Reefer and clipper"" which was ridiculous.  (There's a ship called a 'reefer?')

"First of all, **I** liked the puzzle. It was challenging enough to keep me from threatening my best Thursday time, but not so frustrating that I got stuck. However, my friend Tom Swifty was not so sanguine. Instead, I'm afraid that this puzzle sent old Tom to a dark and despairing place.

Tom's gripe is that the unshaded portions of the theme answers had no additional meaning beyond their assigned clues **with the exception** of 7-Down:

*Blank, e.g., in Scrabble

First, Tom pointed out to me that the unshaded answer made sense, with confidence.

Tom then noted that the shaded answer matched the vertically subsequent shaded answer as an adjacent description of a flame, relieved.

But when Tom, gobsmacked, noticed that the combination of the shaded and unshaded portions of the 7D squares -- i.e. all of them -- created a word that described with medical precision what a common idiom would call ""shooting blanks"", matching the clue ""Blanks"", well... he was ecstatic!

""Cool! Nifty! Groovy keen!"", Tom declared, impressed

""I can't wait to see how the other theme answers play out,"" Tom intoned, optimistic.

Sadly, just like the time that Tom dropped the toothpaste, he moaned, ""This doesn't extend to the other theme answers"", crestfallen.

Please tell me that Tom is mistaken, that there is commensurate meaning in the other theme answers... that he simply lacked the brain power to find it. I fear, concerned, he may lose his passion for eschewing adverbs otherwise.",4,negative,0.466430127620697
"Buggy Thursday puzzle. Solved it, got the music and the congrats message, so as my habit after a solve I go to stats to see how my averages have changed, but notice the Thursday time is still blank. Go back to the main page and see it says I still have clues, open it back up and immediately get the solve music (but not the message) so figure it's a quirk but notice the timer is still running? Repeated this several times to try and get the puzzle to register as solve to no luck, always getting the solve music when I opened it but with the timer continuing to run. Forced myself to go back through the puzzle a few times to double check I didn't typo anything. Eventually got a  ""would you like to resume puzzle"" message when coming back to the app and saying yes to that greeted me with the solve music/message/and timer on opening, but bummed my solve got some needless time added to it.",0,neutral,0.7332733273506165
"(Reposting the comment as the original was probably emu'ed because I used an acronym that was one of the actual answers in the puzzle... And this at a time when The Guardian, the UKs top rated newspaper, has been printing the actual F word for over 5 decades. Sometimes I cannot understand the US)

Wow. I did the puzzle without any lookups in 21 minutes, which is not how Thursdays usually go for me. I quickly understood the theme, and I really enjoyed the cluing - yesterday I was on a totally different wavelength than the constructor, but today we were in sync. I usually dread Thursday puzzles - the tricks make them very hard for a non-native speaker. What a nice surprise this was 😃.

There was some trivia I did not know (CDS clued as bank offerings rather than discs, ARLO clued as a dinosaur... I would prefer the singer Arlo Parks! L...O clued as a duo and not as a texter's slightly impolite expression of extreme amusement, for short), but the crosses helped with it all.

I suppose many solvers will LAMBASTE the puzzle as too easy, but I loved it.",23,neutral,0.49126896262168884

"Oof. 

I opened the puzzle even though my eyes were refusing to stay open tonight. 

Saw David Steinberg’s byline. 

Grunted a bit in a mixture of pleasant anticipation and PTSD. 

Saw the shaded squares. Remembered it was Thursday. 

Hesitated. 

Let me eyelids close most of the way again so that I could regard what lay ahead through the narrowed eyes of that cliched movie character that the theater audience is yelling at, “Don’t do it, bud!” but who does it anyway. You know, that guy in some 70s disaster flick about killer bees who sees a big black swarm headed his way but dips his whole body in honey anyway. 

…

I solved it. But the bee stings sure smart.",11,neutral,0.6273319125175476

And, as usual, it did not disappoint. It never has, it never could because, well, because it's a David Steinberg.

The only disappointment today comes from the news of this being your coda here, your grand finale. 
But what's an ending for us, is a new beginning for you. We are the caterpillar and you are the butterfly. And so, fly you must.

Bidding farewell and wishing you nothing but bright light on your path,  I thank you for your prodigious contributions to this puzzledom. 
Each and every one of your creations has delighted and amazed me. 
Your ingenuity is remarkable and I know it will serve you well wherever you go and whatever you do. 
I also know your dad will always be watching over you.

May the new year and your new journey bring you healthfulness and happiness.
You are truly a force to be reckoned with and there's no doubt in my mind that the road will have to rise to meet you.

I just wrote a pretty long post/rant that has been held hostage.
Presumably, because I used the acronym 43A.  You know, an entry in today's puzzle...

I don't have the energy or memory or motivation to write it again.  And maybe it's better off never being posted.  Maybe it is like a drunk-dial that you regret the morning after.

Oh, yeah.  

My PSA is don't explicitly type out the acronym in 43Across in your comment.  And copy your posts before you submit them, because you never know what the EMU will find offensive.",14,negative,0.7359482049942017

"Thank you, David, for all the wonderful puzzles you’ve created over the years. Best of luck to you in whatever you’re doing next. 

I struggled a bit with this one. I got the SE corner filled early on, and soon realized that the starred clues applied only to the unshaded parts of those answer slots. But it took me longer than it should have to see BLAZE, even after I had FIRE and INFERNO. 

Still, it was fun. I especially liked the clues for GROUP HUG and LGBT.",15,positive,0.9567758440971375
"A great puzzle.  It took me a while to catch on to the theme but then it came together quickly.  I loved CHARLIE as the answer for brown in strips (with the capital B cleverly disguised).  The cook in me kept trying to fit in sautées even though I knew the clue didn’t call for a plural.  Good grief! PORCH for delivery site was cute too.

I hope David Steinberg reconsiders his decision to leave puzzle construction in the past.  His puzzles are always top notch.",18,positive,0.9748342037200928

I was thinking some Thursdayish play with FILAMENTS translating to ""Feel Laments"" but could not make out INFERTILE with the same logic.  The revealer was helpful though.

"Loved this puzzle, which seemed so hard at first, so steep and difficult a climb, but one thing led to another, and once the fire started, the whole place went UP in flames (David's next theme?).

Or not, not for a while? Come back soon: we love you! 2023 was a big tough year for you. From your 6/1/23 puzzle with folks, I reprint your note:

""My dad, Paul, thought of this Reducing Fractions crossword idea years ago. In Dad's proposed implementation, the theme answers were three-square rebus arrangements such as FOUR LINE EIGHT. Dad wasn't a constructor yet, but he loved the twistiness of this idea, so he urged me to use it. I quickly realized that the three-square rebuses were impossible to construct around, so I moved on.

This idea stuck in Dad's head, though: Every so often, he'd ask, ""When are you constructing the Reducing Fractions puzzle?"" and I'd reply, ""I told you: It's impossible!"" Enter my mom, Karen. In 2021, she started constructing regularly, and Dad jumped at the opportunity to revive this idea. Mom tried hard but hit the same roadblocks. One day, I realized we could do a bidirectional, two-square rebus, but because the fractions had to be in order, the number of theme sets would be very limited.

Last year, Dad was diagnosed with atypical Parkinson's, and he's now in hospice. Crosswords are no longer in his life in the same way they once were, but when Mom and I told him Reducing Fractions was running in The Times, he was very happy. This one's for you, Dad!""",28,positive,0.7293543815612793

Then you see 53A - ""Brown in strips.""

Just when I thought things were getting impossible, the theme clicked for me and I could see the light at the end of the tunnel — just a flicker of light, if you will, that much like the theme itself roiled into a five alarmer.
