"This one didn't ELATE me but it clearly was a lot of other people's cup of tea and I'm glad! 

I didn't get the theme at all and had no idea what was going on. I got APARTMENT and LOOK ALIVE by crosses but couldn't figure out how they worked for the clues, so they didn't help. 

Like many, the NE was tough for me. Started with kabob, which kept me a long time from what should have been more obvious - SPINAL. Had no hope of figuring out TECH SAVVY. I know AGHA as a last name but didn't know the honorific. With kabab still there, the other should have been obvious YO YO wasn't coming. I know thank you and you're welcome in several languages, including Russian, but apparently not Italian‚Äîat least not today because it just wasn't coming to me. No clue on Mandarin.

In the middle, I confidently had rusty (corroded) crossing with star (military accessory) and had no hope of figuring out LIE DOWN without changing them and hoping to get it from the other crosses, which made more sense once I got rid of star and rusty.  

Finally resorted to a few lookups to just get done. I rarely use lookups except maybe Fri/Sat these days, so that is a bit of a bummer.

I realize I need to add musical terms to my memory banks if I'm going to continue solving.

"As somebody who does not read music, I found the theme extremely confusing, but I managed to do the puzzle, anyway.

PREGO was a gimme and AGHA became obvious with one or two crosses (AGHA, spelled aga in Polish, was a honorific picked up from Persia by the Tatars, who played a huge part in Polish history, and their language pops up in our literature), so I did not experience the natick that confused some other solvers.

However, I was sort of naticked in the SE corner. Not understanding the theme, I entered LOOK ALIkE, and that resulted in having OYkEY. The latter looked slightly ridiculous, but I've learned so many strange-looking words from these puzzles (looking at you, nerts) I just thought this would be another one of those. I should have know better though! In Polish we write that down as ""oj wej"", and sometimes ""aj waj,"" but that sounds exactly the same as the English OY VEY.

"The 2 Lanai clues reminded me of a story I thought I'd share. We were in Hawaii last summer for a friend's wedding. I'd never been before, so we went a few weeks early to visit some of the other islands. We started off on Maui and after doing the off road ATV tour (which leaves you covered in red dust that is impossible to remove) we walked around Lahaina to kill time before dinner. My wife and I enjoy looking for art that will complement our home. As we passed an art store, I saw some caricature paintings that I thought were well done. I immediately recognised one of Kevin Nealon. I then did a double take, because Kevin Nealon himself was actually standing in front of a painting of himself! We went inside, and it just so happens that he was having his art show. Kevin Nealon took up painting during the pandemic, and it turns out he is pretty good. He's done Chris Farley, Christopher Walken, Rami Malik, and Jennifer Aniston, among many others. He published a book to tell the story of why he painted each person and how he knows them, entitled ""My brushes with fame"". It's definitely worth looking up. Anyway, one painting in particular caught mine and my wife's eye, and we ended up buying it on the spot. It is the most money that we have ever dropped on an impulse purchase, and is the most expensive thing in the house (besides the cars and her engagement ring) but I have zero regrets.

"I hate when people who can read music assume everyone else can. The themed clues were meaningless to me. Luckily, the cross solves were easy. But this felt like too exclusive a theme for the gen pop. No fun for those of us who aren‚Äôt trained musicians.",11,negative,0.8682581186294556
I clawed and guessed my way out of the northeast corner and was able to finish the puzzle. Five minutes slower than my average. Some clues were harder than I expected for a Tuesday.,12,neutral,0.5436713695526123
"Some of this puzzle fell FLAT for me, but the NE corner was super SHARP.  

Some 15 years ago a friend invited me into a writing group that met once a week in the evening. There were about a dozen of us, a philosopher, lawyer, plumber, dog-walker, professors, published poets, a chemist, et al. One of us would volunteer to do ""the prompt"" -- read some published work, then get everyone to do some writing on a particular theme or directive. Then we'd read what we'd written and others would comment. The rules were simple: you could only comment positively on elements that you liked or worked for you. If there was something you didn't like, you kept it to yourself. The group has morphed considerably but we still get together -- by Zoom now, all things considered. For me it's been life-changing: that simple rule, to focus only on the good stuff, has slowly rewired my critical instrumentation. Lewis from Asheville is a master at this and I suspect that he's that way for many things besides puzzles. I'll never be at his level -- he really knows how to seek out hidden pockets of delight -- but I see The Way.

"Since I had no idea about the themed clues (I don‚Äôt read music, though I do a bit now ü§£) crossings were my friends! 

I particularly enjoyed the mini math problem on 41A. 

I finally got to say NIHAO! I learned that and a few more Mandarin words from ‚ÄúSagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat,‚Äù the animated series that ran on PBS for a couple years at the beginning of the millennium. It was based on a children‚Äôs book of the same name by one of my favorite authors, Amy Tan.

Crossword puzzles are such an amazing way to learn new things.  This one somehow allowed a personal best time though I was in learning mode.

Loved it!",25,positive,0.8539919853210449
"I‚Äôd rate this Tuesday Xword puzzle a 2 on the Mohs scale of hardness.  I had almost no treble at all with it.   I‚Äôll give my brain a rest ‚Äî at least forte winks ‚Äî until tomorrow evening, as I expect a major challenge with the Wednesday Xword.",24,negative,0.5489647388458252

 Clever theme, guys. Thanks",39,positive,0.7019363045692444
"Clever, those notes.  I thought I was in trouble, but no, just a fun, smooth solve and more interesting than a lot of Tuesdays.  I was sort of mesmerized, actually.

Thanks Andrew and Garrett.  Good job.",21,positive,0.9395810961723328

"I was sailing along delighted with the slippery clues.  Surprisingly quickly, I filled in the last square and...no music. I spent 2 feverish minutes more as the clock ticked away, fly-specking every clue and word.  I groaned when I realized the answer was one letter different from ""anyhow"".  Missed my Tuesday personal best, but loved the puzzle.",12,positive,0.703394889831543
"Southeast corner tripped me up. LOG clued as a *daily* record made this tricky - I had LOw as in daily low - any repetitive records can be a log, not just daily. The theme didn‚Äôt quite click for me either, although I can read music pretty fluently. Just not my jam today!",0,negative,0.786712110042572

Witty puzzle for a Tuesday and understandable enough for a non-music reader. It's difficult getting stuck on nail polish brands sometimes! Gotta memorize the ones they always repeat and up my crossword game. Glad the Times is back on track with their normal crossword flow.,9,positive,0.5405834317207336
"For the ""Skewered meat dish"" (9A), I wavered between possible spellings, and settled on entering only K-B-B, intending to wait on the crosses for the vowels required.

It turned out to be SATAY.
