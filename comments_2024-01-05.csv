"This often felt impossible to me but it was always fun. I really liked the clues, even the really hard ones!  Maybe especially those!  The middle section and SE came easily. I sure struggled with the other three corners though. 

My favorites were SLICED BREAD and SHIRACHA. Sriracha mostly just because I love Sriracha! I also really loved the clue for SMARTASS! 

There were a number of things I just didn't know in this one, like GODOT --  and many more things that stumped me in this puzzle that I really should have known more quickly. Clever cluing! 

Enjoyed learning about Hanlon's razor. What a great adage!  Even though I hadn't encountered it before, I pretty immediately filled it in with ""intent"" which makes sense too but was obviously wrong.

"I struck out so much at the top that I moved on to solve the bottom first which went super smooth.  Then I confidently went back to the top and felt super dumb lol!  This morning I had a good breakfast and went back in and finished it with ease.  What a difference a day (and food!) makes lol. 

Like Deb I was set on ""ewe"" and then wasn't then was until I had more crosses. 

I had EA_ERBEA_ER with zero ideas on how to finish it for longer than I'd like to admit.  I think there are just some letter combinations my brain has a tough time with when presented vertically. OH! And I REALLY wanted the answer for 20 Across: ""One arriving tomorrow, supposedly"" to be ""today"". I don't know why GODOT is the answer but I haven't read through the comments yet.

SLICEDBREAD absolutely cracked me up!

Today‚Äôs took me a shade over 20, and although it may seem wondrous to some of you, it was quite slow for a Friday.

cluing conventions, that‚Äôs on you.

But crossing that slang with a B-level TV actor from decades ago (and I am a Gen Xer) and a reference to the broadcast network of a short-lived TV series (no way to tell cBS from TBS) is just frustrating. It was also completely avoidable ‚Äî it would even have helped to just clue TBS with something more standard like a reference to Ted Turner. 

My personal rule is to complete every puzzle without lookups. In this case I didn‚Äôt care enough to try because I knew there was no way short of a Google search to suss out the T and the K.

I follow the dictum ""no stress"" because I must.

Part of the beauty of puzzles is the reminder that I'm in control of what I'm feeling, which makes them a good practice for all of life.  
And puzzles offer the benefit of putting, right at my fingertips, resources to dial down the disquiet, something not so readily available in life.

That's why I turned on autocheck one third of the way in.

I looked up how to spell SRIRACHA, which I had spelled SIRRACHA.

There was nothing else I could cheat on -- the mark of a good puzzle, btw, -- so I came here, making sure I just looked at 1A and saw nothing else.  (I had the final A).  Aha, PLASMA.  I wrote it in.

No help at all.  So I gave in and looked at the solution -- and the unfairnesses just screamed out at me:

"Put me down as someone who also found this one on the tougher side. It was just one of those puzzles that I had to tug, prod, and poke at until the answers start to emerge from the clues. Especially the NW and SW. Very nice, David.

Deb's question and our constructor's quest for 13 sent me on a post-solve read of literary criticism of Wallace Stevens's poem, which I pulled from JStor. My conclusion is similar to Puzzlemucker's -- I think David is using Wallace's blackbird as a metaphor for this particular puzzle grid. Yes, it's exactly the same grid but what we get from each installment depends on the fill and the cluing. It's quintessentially impressionistic.

I'll share an exposition of the third stanza that I especially liked from my readings. This comes from Price Caldwell of Mississippi State University, ""Metaphoric Structures in Wallace Stevens' 'Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird,'"" published in The Journal of English and Germanic Philology (1972):

There are at least three movements in the stanza. First, the wind, invisible to the eye, is made visible to the imagination by the whirling blackbird. Second, the chaotic motion of the blackbird in the wind is structured as the formal, abstracted motion of pantomime is juxtaposed to it. Third, pantomime as a mental construction is realized as, in effect, the bird becomes its actor and the winds its stage. As in stanza I the lines create both thing-as-idea and idea-as thing.",22,positive,0.4962918758392334

"I enjoy how often a ‚Äúpithy quote fill in the blank‚Äù clue can have several possible words that make for just as pithy a quote.

Really enjoyed the flying on this puzzle. Curious about the poem connection though I don‚Äôt find the poem itself particularly intriguing.,5,positive,0.8966273665428162

Quite the variety of material.

Well played, David Williams.",34,positive,0.9564259052276611
"Yesterday, Richard from NYC posed the question:

Anyone know the record for most recos (sic) of a comment? Anyone? Anyone?
https://youtu.be/uhiCFdWeQfA

I was a bit surprised that none of our grey-haired, longtime posters chimed in with a reply. It‚Äôs certainly a question that has occurred to me. I see that Paul from Wisconsin received well in excess of 200 reccos yesterday, so far the 2024 record (and still climbing). Perhaps someone with time on their hands (or a paid intern at NYT games) could enlighten us about the 2023 champ.",6,neutral,0.8761010766029358

"I was not especially tired.

I was not in a situation or location that lent itself to slowing down the solve.

But this puzzle did take me a decent amount of time to get through, with the top two corners falling last.

Enough so that I'm willing to wager that the Saturday puzzle will be easier, at least for me.

As to the connection to the poem, of this I couldn't care the slightest iota.  I read the poem when the first of these puzzles  was published, and did not find anything remarkable about it, nothing to bring me in, to hold my interest.  And if this series of puzzles continue  to drop at a rate of two or three a year, wake me up when the 13th of them drops, and tell me the big secret, and then I'll be ready to die a happy man.  

Or not.",7,neutral,0.6024782061576843
"A struggle for me.  Felt Saturdayish than many Saturdays.  Not a complaint.  That CHEERLEADER felt so right for so long for ‚ÄúEnthusiastic sort‚Äù was just the longest of many either no-knows and know-wrongs for me.
