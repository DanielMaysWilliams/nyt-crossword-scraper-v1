"A fun puzzle. I saw the them right away, and just entered BRIDGE at all the BRIDGEs. I was maybe ¼ of the way through when I realized what the single letters could be. It's a great feat of construction and it was fun to solve. 

I was pleased that there are relatively few complaints. When I saw how many comments there were, I assumed it would be a real chore to read piles and piles of complaints. But there seem to be relatively few. (I did NOT read through all of the almost 500 comments to verify!). That's a pleasant change from the usual. 

This is way later than usual for me to be getting to the puzzle. Part of the reason for this is that I took a rode to find a print copy of today's NYT, so I could get the Puzzlemania section. I had to go all the way to Orono (a well known crossword answer) and the first place I checked was out and they suggested another. I had assumed I'd have to go all the way into Bangor, but nope -- I got the last print copy in Orono, apparently. Phew!

As I typed them in, just the edge of each letter appeared as though it were peeking out from under the bridge. Kind of disappointed those shy letters ducked back under the bridges again with the happy music, but did like the way that discovering the hidden letters happened all at once at the end.

"A near record Sunday for me at 40:29 with no lookups. However, that is in large part due to the notes saying that there is a rebus.

Yes, it's nice, but the expectation of the unknown and unwrapping it is all part of the fun.

Also, here to complain about the use of REARLIT as opposed to backLIT. This did slow me down quite a bit, and the only reason I clued in is because rearlit was used in a crossword earlier this year, although it is certainly not as common as backlit in photography speak.

"Two things I especially love about this puzzle.

First, it would have worked with simply having the bridges going over the various waters, with the revealer WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE, a sweet punny rebus theme.  But no, Jeremy took it one step farther by having the letters under the bridges spell a word – BYGONES – related to the metaphorical meaning of that revealer.  A brilliant leap, IMO, adding a lovely layer of complexity, not to mention a layer of difficulty to the solve.

Second, the puzzle’s title – GET OVER IT – relates to using a bridge to cross over water, as well as meaning “put it behind you”, perfectly relating to BYGONES.  This title is the sweet bow tying everything together.  Perfect!

Adding the layer of difficulty to the solve certainly added a huge layer of difficulty to the construction, but that’s what good constructors do in service to the solver.  Jeremy is a Sunday pro, with two-thirds of his 27 puzzles over 17 years falling on this day, and his skill shined in this grid

"Here’s a suggestion. 

The WORDLE Bot provides an average number of guesses for all successful solvers. On Saturday’s crossword I thought I posted a good solving time (for me anyway), and I wondered how it might stack up to the rest of the NYT crossword community. It seems entirely possible that successful solving times could be aggregated and averaged to provide such a statistic. It might be necessary to set an upper limit to omit times of those solvers who take a long break to let the clues marinate. On some Sundays, for example I begin the puzzle Saturday night, retire, and finish up on Sunday morning. These scores would skew the average to the point on meaninglessness, but for those who finish a puzzle in one sitting, an average of successful solvers might provide a good metric to measure progress. 

Another possible flaw might be including in the scores of solvers who use Google to finish with purists who gut it out. Not sure I have a possible solution to that glitch. The Honor System?

"What a great puzzle.  The theme was solid throughout.  I got the ""bridge"" part right away, the crossing gimmick took me forever to notice that the blue shaded squares spelled out bodies of water INCLUDING the bridge (or the water under the bridge, rather), and also that the regular clue answers didn't include that square.  So, three things going on that the solver had to grok.  Luckily the puzzle led me by the nose and I eventually understood all three.  

BYGONES was another nice touch that was tightly tied to the theme.

The only clue I didn't get until after I read the comments was SIXTY.  I mean I got SIXTY I just didn't understand why it was the answer!

I was determined to get credit for this solve, so when I had filled in the grid and didn't get a ""congratulations"" I went through every clue again and finally found my error.

I had WDAR not WEAR, and when I checked the crossing clue I fixed it right away.

But since there was no way for me to know either of those things, I feel justified in looking them up, and I consider my gold star fairly earned today.

This was the first ever rebus I enjoyed since I started doing these puzzles in June - mostly because it was very easy for a rebus, and apparently an easy rebus is the only kind I like 🤣.

I did not know some of the trivia, but the crosses helped me with it.

I have two questions I would appreciate the community's help with:

1. I am somewhat ashamed to admit that I do not understand how BYGONES relate to either bridges or watery features. Could somebody please explain that to me? Apparently this is on a level of abstraction that eludes a non-native speaker.

"After pondering over this puzzle for a couple of hours now, I've come to the conclusion that the puzzle tries to do too much.  It would have been a perfectly fine puzzle with the revealer at 114A and a reinforcer at 122A--already a complicated puzzle, where the gimmick squares are a bridge (and represent the letters BRIDGE) in one direction, and nothing at all (""Get Over It"") in the other direction.  A little beyond the usual, but I could admire that.

It goes off the track when the directions say to either take the letters of BYGONES or ""an appropriate rebus"" (i.e. something else) and put them into the ""seven key squares"".  So these issues now arise:

1. You can put the rebus BRIDGE in each ""key square"", but there's literally already a bridge there, rendering the word BRIDGE redundant and pointless.  Then in the other direction, using the first occurrence as an example, you have SNBRIDGEOG in the other direction...it can be a two-way rebus, but you need to represent it some way.  And yet, the actual word SNOG is already complete.

2. Or you can put the letters of BYGONES in the ""key squares"".  In the same example, now you have SNBOG, which is nonsense.  I get that you want BOG to be the ""body of water"" (not sure that a bog really is one, anyway, but that's beside the point), but the truth is, now you have SNBOG.  When the original blank space is just fine.

I went over everything and thought all was right, so I went to the answer key and everything matched - including BRIDGE being in each rebus square. A bit flummoxed, I came back and emptied all the rebus squares. That didn't do it, so I added the letters from BYGONES to each one and finally got the happy music. I'm not sure what I did wrong but I don't care about time - only improvement and I otherwise sailed through this one and thought it was very cute and fun!

(When I saw ""How Reubens are made"" I assumed the Flemish painter* & began casting about for an art phrase of 5 letters: in oil, by pen, etc. That's how I want my art!)

Loved the two clock clues, both of which threw me for a bit: What takes a toll? ONE PM. Count on one hand? SIXTY.

So I went over to xwordinfo to see if those had ever been clued similarly before. Turns out that ""What takes a toll?"" is ONE AM in a puzzle from 11-5-20. Too bad, I thought, it won't make the Lewis List. Hmm, who created that puzzle anyway? Jeremy Newton! What the...!??

"Brilliant, multilayered puzzle. One of my all-time faves for clever construction!",28,positive,0.981303334236145
"Got my Gold star without putting anything in the rebuses. The clues are still dark but I’m happy.

Very cool puzzle, easy for me as I got the *bridge* right off the bat but I finished the puzzle (and got my gold star) without filling in the rebuses so I had to stare at the finished puzzle to understand the bottom circled letters.

I really like this puzzle. Loved the artistry, I live puzzles with an added twist and artwork built into the grid!",12,positive,0.9461538791656494
"This is a puzzle I was so happy to solve 
with stylus on a stone tablet. 
No questions about what would be accepted as an entry 
-- or even if anything needed to be entered -- 
in the ""bridge"" squares. 
Just a clever if not puzzling crossword.

(As I started into the grid, 
I was hoping the letters under the bridges 
might be B R I D G E S. 
Three of them were. 
I got over it.)   

Note on 8D:
While our state's AG and her team 
have been busy with a civil case, 
I'm thinking DAS spend most of their time 
on criminal cases and don't 
""often need new suits for work.""

Thank you, Jeremy.",16,positive,0.8603096008300781
I understood the theme quickly but cannot get the rebus function to work. Super frustrating to be unable to finish the puzzle even though I solved every clue.,6,negative,0.8684679865837097
"I loved this fun idea.

But here’s what it sounded like:
“Ooh, what are those?”
“Wait, they’re telling us ahead of time there is a rebus???”
“But the thingy hides the place I put in the rebus.”
 “I know! I’ll turn off the overlays while solving and then it will be more fun.”

And it was!  
So, applied problem solving.

"I think it was a pretty good puzzle...And the rebus and the bodies of water was technically a really good idea.

But the physical execution of the puzzle...with the blue stripe and the bridge on the puzzle was distracting....and made it hard to tell which boxes you were on...EXPECIALLY since that function is also blue in the puzzle.

And the instructions...although telling just created confusion.  Maybe they were necessary since many people just do Sunday and never do a Thursday....so having a rebus could have been a shock.",16,positive,0.5615907907485962
