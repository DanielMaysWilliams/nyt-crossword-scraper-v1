Amen!  Debâ€™s the best.

"I havenâ€™t done todayâ€™s puzzle or read the the comments.

I did yesterdayâ€™s. It was fine. Our awesome columnist said as much. Unlike most of us, she actually has to write an entire column, hence she ventured to add that it could have been better, that an extra layer would have elevated it, and yes, sharing an example to make her point.

Obviously she felt she was in a safe space where she could voice her opinion. This community that she helped build. Where she has kindly and graciously welcomed newcomers for years, walking them through the ropes sharing tips and warnings of what to be on the lookout for. I was one of those who learned so much from Deb. In passing out all the bits about crosswords, she also shared her heart. It was clear that she was kind and well meaning.
Definitely not the type to be motivated by spite.

So yesterday she wrote a column that wasnâ€™t sufficiently koombaya by this communityâ€™s standards. Did they say â€˜Oh, itâ€™s Deb, and we know she means wellâ€™? Did they say â€˜we know her heartâ€™s in the right placeâ€™? Did they extend grace to one who unceasingly extends it?

Thereâ€™s always been a tendency to shut down any and all criticism of puzzles. Seeing what happened to Deb yesterday, it seems this tendency has been taken too far. So she felt a puzzle fell a little short. So what? Sheâ€™s done tons of puzzles, she can tell. Sheâ€™s paid to share her thoughts on the solving experience. She did. She was doing her job! Letâ€™s respect that and cut her some slack.",122,positive,0.6693723797798157
"But Deb, you can't just use any old diacritic and expect to look cool.  ""WÃ¶rdplÃ¤y"" is metal; ""WÃ¸rdplÃ£y"" looks like the subtitle of a Monty Python movie.  Sorry, I don't make the rules.",30,negative,0.7088310122489929
