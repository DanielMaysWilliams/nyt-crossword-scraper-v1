"You got me on this one like in the old days! I came in slower than average. I think you may have sold me on Sunday crosswords, John Kugelman. Wonderful entries.

I was hoping:

1. ‚ÄúPan handle‚Äù would be ‚ÄúFader‚Äù like in electronic music but I see why it‚Äôs PETER. 

2. NUMBER OF THE BEAST would be NUMBER OF THE Cross ;)
and

3. EN BLOC would be Cap LOC(Ok that doesn‚Äôt make sense) or really at first ‚ÄúFull on‚Äù for the clue, ‚ÄúAll together‚Äù, but I was so proud of myself in those first two mistakes. 

Oh and totally did not get ‚ÄúMagician‚Äù because of no lookups until I gave up after an hour+ but this would have been worth taking a few days. I loved WANDER ABOUT TOWN and had forgotten about AURORS but got it on the crosses. I think my mom‚Äôs more impressed if I don‚Äôt do lookups. That's crazy to feel, I know! Yeah so I had WANDerer Unknown.",0,positive,0.9280076026916504

"What an absolute delight!! I don't even think I could pick a top five of favorites out of this puzzle because every single clue and answer seemed perfect to me! JUNK DRAWER cracked me up, so did hits the space bar for ALIEN and NUMBER OF THE BEAST!  All the themers were great! SUPER DUPER being my least favorite but that's kind of like saying I have a less favorite taco... All tacos are fantastic! I just maybe prefer a chicken tinga over a ground beef one... doesn't mean I don't love both! üòâ  Anyhow, I found this a pretty perfect puzzle!

And I felt great about my improving crossword skills when I NAILED IT by realizing quickly that it was appropri-ate not appropri-et. 

I'm embarrassed by how long it took me to get ELROY and ASTRO! I kept running through the song and I could picture them both but kept blanking at their names. But I knew they would come to me.

On the other hand, how in the world did I immediately know ASPIC!? I have never made it, I would never be inclined to eat it, and I have no idea why I knew it. Meat jelly?! ü§î

I never heard of IN A PET so that held me up a bit -- along with thinking Dash's partner was Door for a very long time -- but I didn't get in a pet about it!  So fun!",9,positive,0.9715830087661743

"The theme, which I took a while to catch on to, stirs to action the idle ‚Äúer‚Äù element in words like NUMBER, giving an ordinary noun or adjective the new meaning ‚Äúone who does (X).‚Äù It activates in two senses.

"In case anyone else was suddenly struck by the curious phrase ""an albatross around one's neck"" and wanted to know its origins, but was then distracted by some amusing themers, here you go....

""Ah! well a-day! What evil looks

"I like the way this puzzle takes a not uncommonly used idea from punny clues in the NYT crossword (clues that have a question mark at the end) but turns it on its head.

The idea of using these dual-meaning words in clues happens pretty frequently. One that comes to mind is ‚ÄúWanders around the airport?‚Äù as a clue for TSA. I‚Äôm sure I have seen all of -er words in the theme answers in today‚Äôs puzzle used in punny clues in the past two years.

But finding common phrases that use these words and making them the themers (instead of using the words in the clues) by cluing the the themers to the lesser-used (or perhaps unofficial) definition of the particular -er word was a wonderfully clever idea that led to fun and enjoyable results.

"Loved this one. One small critique that threw me for a while, the meaning of ""BEEFED"", at least to us younger folks is less complaint than it is conflict. Beef as a noun vs a verb have evolved into different slang terms. Saying ""I'd had beef with them/that"" would mean complaint, but the verb form of ""I beefed/I'm beefing with them"" implies an interaction of some sort. The Cambridge dictionary conflated the two with their definition, and their example phrase ""he was beefing about having to do the shopping"", is not a way I've heard the word used in common parlance. It might have had that grammatical usage in the past, I don't know.

TLDR: nowadays, beef as complaint is usually congugated as a noun, whereas congugated as a verb it is more synonymous to ""feud"".",11,neutral,0.47964027523994446

"Some Sunday puzzle groaners (JUNKDRAWER indeed) on a Saturday night: a nice end to a nice day.  I was not vexed by VORTEXES, although my preferred plural is vortices.  The lovely Indigo Girls song, POWEROFTWO, was a gimme for me.  Their harmonies are always so gorgeous.

I liked seeing ALEC Guinness pop up. Although many younger movie lovers associate him primarily with the Star Wars franchise, for me his best work was in the comedies of his younger years including The Lady Killers and The Lavender Hill Mob.

Here‚Äôs hoping all my fellow puzzlers made out well through the weekend‚Äôs storms and continue to do so through the coming polar vortex.",19,positive,0.9663062691688538
"Because I knew that ""boot"" is the UK term for what we independence-minded English-speakers call ""the trunk"" (natch, as ""trunks"" refer to methods of storage, and a car's trunk is the anthropomorphic analog of the rear end, not the feet, which is where one generally affixes a ""boot"", do you put shoes on your butt, I think not), I immediately understood that:

105D.    Some carry a spare one in a boot

referred to those round rubbery things that keep our sedans (not ""saloons"", because saloons are places and don't move without considerable effort, I mean really, zoning permits alone, can you imagine?) in motion without creating a fire hazard.

What I didn't remember and likely never will remember is that the Brits cheekily spell ""tire"" with a ""y"", sort of like how I spelled my name Gerg when I was five and didn't know how to tie my shoes or regulate my consumption of cereal. Seriously, I will **never** remember this because I never do.

Anyway, I had a feeling that the answer might be another bit of mental jabberwocky, but the crosses were all in agreement but one. As I hadn't cracked the theme yet, I couldn't yet be sure that ""ANNOFFERIOU CANTREFUSE"" was objective nonsense. Boot... saloon... petrol... glove box... what do they call sweaters again?

In other words, it's more fun to blame this on Britain than to resolve to remember more things.",15,neutral,0.7962972521781921

I don't mind the Harry Potter answers‚Ä¶ I read the books when my youngest was into them and found them to be fairly quick reads and entertaining. So AUROR was a gimme, and the WAND-ER around town was clever as well.

There was a lot to like here, and my only regret is that I got finished too quickly.

I didn't know AUROR (I know next to nothing about tormenting a clay artisan*) but thankfully PETER was nicely clued.

"Hi Caitlin,

I had fun with the puzzle, but I didn't read the theme and title quite the way you did.  

You write ""...all of which include at least one two-letter interjection adding another meaning to the entry.""

But the er or ers don't change the meanings; the words *containing* them have different meanings. The themer clues ask for a wacky reading of an ordinary phrase using a different sense of a word containing the -er. 

I read ER, IN OTHER WORDS... to mean ""ER in words that have other meanings.""

YMMV

First, a big round of applause for @Tito for coming up with the idea of the Puzzle of the Year awards and for shepherding us through the POY process these past 4 years.  The POYs are less about which puzzles ""win"" than about paying tribute to *all* NYT Xword constructors.
