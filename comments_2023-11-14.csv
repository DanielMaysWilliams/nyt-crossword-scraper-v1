"Nice puzzle, Matthew, with a charming theme.
I've never heard of wishing on an eyelash or at 11:11 time.

"I had forgotten about the eyelash wish op, but when I was in high school, if you saw an eyelash on a friend's cheek, you gently removed it, squeezed it between thumb and forefinger, then you both made a wish and guessed whether it would stick to thumb or forefinger.  The correct guess meant a wish came true.  My wishes were modest, and it seemed unfair that they so seldom came true.

"Timely puzzle! Last night, on my last outing with my pups, I was admiring Orion while my two gals took care of business. Jupiter was putting on a great show up high, and a lowering Saturn was on the southern horizon. I returned my gaze to Orion, admiring his shiny belt and ""sword,"" when a lovely SHOOTING STAR  streaked by for about a second or two, just to his right (my left). Actually, it was an attention-grabbing fireball -- one of the famed Leonids that are active right now -- peaking this weekend, as I recall. Living in a place far from city lights is awesome! 

Also: Today's Universal Crossword is well worth doing. In addition to a theme that should please language lovers, it has a couple of entries that yours truly found personally very gratifying.

"I only know wishing on an eyelash as follows: someone you like or love (close enough to touch their face unbidden) has an eyelash that has fallen onto their cheek and you take it and hold it in front of them for them to make a wish, and then they blow it off of your palm. In short, a two-person operation. Take it from one whose partner had very thick dark eyelashes prone to falling off…

What I grew up with was “wishies” - the fluffy white airborne seeds that fill the air on certain days. The ritual was complex. You had to catch the wishie without catching it: get it to rest on your outheld palm without grasping or clutching. If you managed that, you had to make your whole wish while it was still on your palm. If you managed that, you released it to the wind and kept an eye on it as long as it was in sight. If you never saw it touch the ground, your wish would come true. I literally tried this on my Sunday walk yesterday, and failed yet again.",17,neutral,0.8020042181015015

"Who knew?  I have missed out on SO many wishing opportunities.  It just breaks my heart.  Just take ELEVEN ELEVEN alone.  I did the math,  based on twice per day, and the clock has been at ELEVEN ELEVEN more than 59,000 times since I was born. Alas, I didn't wish on a single one of them.

Then the EYELASH-on-face thing.  I wasn't paying attention, but I'm sure it's happened many, many times.  Let's just add that to the 59,000+ figure.  Okay?

Now I've never seen a SHOOTING STAR, but I have brushed LADYBUGS off my clothes.  If not in Central Park, then in the country.  And also at camp as a child.  I didn't know they were lucky; yucky was more like it.  But they owe me big time.

I figure I've got oodles of unused wishes coming to me and I don't intend to let the DANDELIONS grow under my feet before starting to make up for lost time.  Thank you, Puzzle, for this eye-and-eyelash-opening fount of useful information!",13,negative,0.7152290940284729

"Speaking of wishes, one of my crossword fantasies is that Patrick Berry return to making NYT puzzles.  

He is in the highest strata of my constructor Valhalla.  A master clue-maker, a master theme-maker.  Brilliant all around, arguably the best puzzlemaker ever.  He is still is publishing elsewhere, and why his puzzles have not shown up in the Times is a mystery.

If you want to experience his genius, do this set of six puzzles which ran consecutively during one week in the Times in 2011 as a contest.  The last of the six connects them all together.  I will never forget it.  The best way to do them is from here -- https://www.xwordinfo.com/Contest -- where you can print them out as PDFs.  You can also access the answer sheets from this page.",7,positive,0.9401465654373169

ELEVEN ELEVEN:  a watched watch never boils...or something to that effect..
DANDELION:  would you puh-leeze stop sowing those in my flower beds!?!
EYE LASH:  Sorta heard of this one, but mine usually get INTO my eye, where they cause no end of trouble, which seems UNlucky.

The moral of this puzzle is:  if WISHes were horses, you'd need to compost that manure, but at least WISHing wouldn't be a complete waste of your time.

As to today's puzzle - relieved to see I'm not the only one who wasn't familiar with all of the wishful items. LADYBUG in particular would lead me to think about: ""fly away home. Your house is on fire..."" etc. Not a problem. I worked it out.
