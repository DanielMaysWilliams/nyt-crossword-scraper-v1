"Fun puzzle overall. 

I do not get the theme. Even when I get it-  I do not get it.",4,negative,0.6087138652801514
"Never has a theme gone so completely over my head. Often I won‚Äôt really understand while solving, but a bit of thought post-solve makes it clear. Not so today. I don‚Äôt know why any of these words are ‚Äòout of sorts‚Äô, and I don‚Äôt know why  OUT OF is highlighted. This has left me feeling snorty.",6,negative,0.8002822995185852

That was a really nice theme.  I didn't get it until I was done but coming up with those answers and fitting them into the puzzle was spectacular.  It was a feat of construction which deserved much more than Tuesday-level cluing.  Much enjoyed and close to a PB for me.,18,positive,0.98095703125
Nearly my best time ever on a Tuesday. Thanks to Nate for a clean and clever puzzle right before finals week.,8,positive,0.9885411262512207
"Not a record time, but a very smooth (and enjoyable!) solve today. I have to admit I rather agree with Sam Corbin on the theme - not quite getting what it meant been after completing the puzzle. It's very clever, and a good piece of wordplay, but also rather strangely obtuse at the same time. One wonders if there might not have been a better way to word it.",7,positive,0.8707324862480164
"I wonder if the emus are OUT OF SORTS.

I liked the puzzle, and I hope others do too.

This is a second try at posting.


Thanks (again), Nate!
