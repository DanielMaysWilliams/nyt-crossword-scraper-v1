I almost always go for the short ones first, never, ever the long fills.  Is that very different from you?

I don't understand the clue for INERT (2D).  But that's the only clue in this puzzle I don't like; mostly I thought the clues were inspired.

I had a tab open to the Thursday comments and, before closing it, looked of any new comments.

That's fine -- there are words I'm not fond of, or certain usages or definitions of words I don't care for (octopi, anyone?), but I don't expect constructors to cater to my own personal preferences. 

Our own Eric H. replied, suggesting that that Patrick check out the definition of PEG in a dictionary. 

That was met with a reply, written by Don from MD, claiming that it was NOT in ""any dictionary to which I have access"" and Don specifically cited Wiktionary.org, claiming that of the 18 definitions provided, not a single one related to throwing. 

So I went there to see for myself: There are 18 definitions of PEG used as a *noun* and none of them, of course define a *verb* meaning to throw. 

But if Don had bothered to continue to scroll down to the verb definition, he would have found that there are 13 entries of PEG as a verb, the 5th of which is simply ""To throw"".

"A COSET is not a group! The clue for 38A is driving me crazy. Obviously clues are not necessarily definitions (though even the abominable MW gets it right) and it is Saturday, but this one is just too far off. A subgroup is a coset (if you forget about its algebraic structure), but most of the time cosets are not subgroups. It has been clued coherently in the past: ""subdivision in group theory"" and ""algebraic grouping"" are much better.

Here is a concrete example: The integers {...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...}=Z are a group under addition. For a fixed integer N, the  multiples of N {...,-2N,-N,0,N,2N,...}=NZ form a subgroup, since the sum of two multiples of N is a multiple of N, etc., with N cosets, NZ, NZ+1, NZ+2, ... , NZ+(N-1). When N=2 this is just evens (the subgroup) and odds (the other coset), when N=12 you get clock arithmetic. An odd plus an odd is even, so the odd numbers do not form a subgroup.

Here is one way to think about it. One could sensibly (and unimaginatively) clue, say, ""insect"" with ""ladybug"", and nobody would complain since a ladybug is a sort of insect, but nobody thinks ""here is the class of cosets"" and then gives a subgroup as a typical example.",5,negative,0.6844292283058167
"I really liked this one. Got practically nothing on the first pass other than a good feel for the clueing, which gave me some hope. MERCYBUCKETS was a lucky guess with very little to go on, but it opened up the middle for me. From there I was able to get the corners and the gold star. Proper names were no help, as NILES, LOLA and RONNIE might as well live on the SOMALI Peninsula as far as I knew. I held on to drIpPy. For way too long. It didnt seem right but I was pretty sure that STRIPY needed an e. That was my last holdout and I finished enough under my average to feel good about myself, which is all you can ask for a Saturday puzzle. Go Heels!",7,positive,0.9283531904220581
"Thanks, John, for giving me FITS this morning.

The long answers seemed to go in relatively easily, but I spent about 30% of my total time trying to decide what letter to put in for the _ITS/_ANS crossing.  I kept going through the alphabet in my head, but nothing seemed to work.  I finally decided on F with extreme low confidence, guessing that it was like bringing two ends of a seatbelt together.  Now I can see ""FIT your needs"" is just like ""meet your needs"", but for whatever reason, that was just not coming to me.  Right answer for the wrong reason?  I'll take it!

I never would have gotten the baseball term (I wasn't even sure it was actually related to baseball), so I'm just glad I was able to hang on to my streak.",11,positive,0.58576500415802

I did like MERCY BUCKETS a lot.

Now to see if I can post my comment with no problems.",6,negative,0.49035197496414185
"I found this quite a challenge. NE and SE corners were brutal. I just couldn't give up on [do the TIME] and VHS was anachronistically difficult.

In the SW I held on to TAX BLueS for a long time.

Finally got gold but it took walking away from the puzzle twice.",6,negative,0.7672806978225708
"Great puzzle! It felt so fresh and contemporary with entries like INFODEMIC, NEW NORMAL and DIGITAL DETOX, as well as the fun seed entry MERCY BUCKETS. 

I like the symmetry of JURYRIGGING and NO LUCK SO FAR. 

Fun adjacency of I GOTTA RUN and CIAO.  I also like the crossing of COMEDY with SLY DOGS, and the adjacent GAGS.  

Great clue for INERT. 

Well done, John.  I‚Äôm adding this to my list of themeless favorites.",10,positive,0.9746880531311035
"Two entries really smelled bad to me in this puzzle: INFODEMIC and TAX BITES. It pleases me that the Wordplay article linked to the OED entry for the latter, as it showed the usage frequency of ‚Äútax bites‚Äù as 30 parts per billion. By comparison, the acceptable level of lead in drinking water is 15 ppb‚Ä¶

Put another way, if one were to read 10000 words per day, one would expect to see ‚Äútax bites‚Äù once every nine years or so. I.e., NO ONE EVER SAYS THIS IN REAL LIFE.",5,negative,0.7891133427619934
"I realize these are edited by human beings, but I‚Äôm still confused about why certain short answers, which I assume are the editors‚Äô choices, appear in bunches. For example, PBJ has appeared several times in the past week or so, after not showing up for a while. It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs a bad answer, but if you play every day, you see the repetition and it detracts from the challenge, for me anyway.

"I liked this Saturday.   My only huge struggle was my final square of the puzzle, which was 31 and took me minutes to figure out.   I am not a baseball FAN, and thus I never heard of the slang term of fanning to arrive a player out.   I was thinking Bans for strike outs, not Fans.   But, Bit did not make sense for Meet... whereas Fit was a plausible match (does this fit your needs /does this meet your needs) and voila I got my star to keep my steak alive.",9,positive,0.5687258243560791
"Great Saturday puzz! Easier than Friday this week, but still very satisfying!",4,positive,0.9867948889732361
"This was my kind of Saturday puzzle - hard but enjoyably doable. I only needed to look up the meaning of concupiscent, and two or three names, but some of the trivia I knew, which rarely happens. I felt a pang of nostalgia at Remington STEELE, which was one of the shows on satellite tv that my parents got in the early 90s so I could watch stuff in English to learn it better. I also remembered TELEOLOGY from the philosophy course at university.

I was slightly confused by JURYRIGGING - I thought the term was jerry-rigging? The latter was my instant answer to MacGyvering, but it did not fit. Reluctantly I entered JeRYRIGGING, but that did not work, and looked very wrong. I googled both terms, including their etymologies, but I would appreciate it if somebody kindly explained to me how they are used in everyday language by native speakers. Which is more common? Do they mean the same?",17,positive,0.7979007959365845
"Despite a lot of names of persons unknown to me and a number of phrases or terms with which I was not familiar, I got this one done in a reasonable time.  That philosophy course I took in college finally paid off, by giving me TELEOLOGY, and DOUBT (as the Cartesian source of wisdom) to compensate for the things that were foreign to me.  DIORAMAS in shoeboxes  evoked memories of elementary school days.  All in all an educational and fun puzzle.",8,positive,0.6797091364860535

Even with a lot of gimmes there were fills for this one that just wouldn't fill for way too long. The SW was my first solved corner so it always comes down to the wheelhouse (especially happy to see AUGIE March), but actually, none of this puzzle was what I would call easy. In the end it was clever and satisfying, but both Thursday and Friday were much easier for me.

Agreed Caitlin on stripy looking wrong.",13,positive,0.8951624631881714
"After reading the first few Across clues, I thought that this would be a real challenge. The clues for DIORAMA, ISLE and GRAN are vague; I didn‚Äôt know the word INFODEMIC; as much as I love listening to Dvo≈ô√°k‚Äòs music, I couldn‚Äôt have told you that the second movement of his 9th symphony is marked LARGO (though it‚Äôs here on the iPad I solve on) . . . . 

So after a minute, I switched to the Downs and MERCY BUCKETS popped right in. After that, the answers came in a nice, steady flow. 

Most of the eight words that appear for the first time are fun words to see in a grid. I‚Äôm a bit surprised that JURY-RIGGING, I GOTTA RUN and SOLO ALBUM are debuts. 

Thanks for the fun, Mr. Guzzetta!",14,neutral,0.5678641200065613
"Nice.  I got it done with change from one hour, so I'm happy.  But first go-around was very unpromising with 44A STEELE and 14D CLEF the only gimmes.  Oh and MONT-St-Michele.  But STEELE begat CLAUSE and CLEF begat FIDGET and I was on my way.  

A worthy Saturday.",11,positive,0.9199231266975403
"Enjoyed the vibe of Remington Steele (1987-91), MacGyver (1985-92), VHS tapes, solo albums and eps vs. digital detox, the new normal, diodes and infodemics. Also was amused by some of the parings: teleology, which examines results, goals and purposes in order to explain something, and root causes (aetiology), which examines underlying reasons, background, motives. Also: Isle (clued as Key) near Largo: cue Key Largo, an old noir movie with Bogart and Bacall. The film's music was scored by Max Steiner, so having Isle/Stein/Largo made nutty sense to me. 

It's funny about the pronouncements in this puzzle, Leary positing comedy as the ultimate free speech, Descartes that doubt is the source of knowledge. If some comedian said that doubt was the source of all comedy, I would have nodded just as sagely. If some philosopher had said that comedy was the source of all knowledge, I would have given that some thought and ultimately agreed.  If some talking head on tik-tok said that free speech was the root cause of our current infodemic, I'd shut my laptop, go on digital detox, and pick up The Adventures of Augie March, a beautiful book, with prose so rich and giddy it's like consuming a slice of really good cheesecake -- one made with plenty of eggs. Apple sauce? Include me out!

"Nice puzzle. Though I did check puzzle when i got stuck about a third of the way through and was surprised to see the only thing I had wrong was STalk instead of STEMS for asparagus. 

Unlike several earlier posters, I did know LOLA Kirke, who's the sister of Jemima Kirke, one of the Girls in Lena Dunham's show. I think both shows were on around the same time.

Can't rightly decide if you're responsible for ending the week on a high note, or leaving the gate open for a fun weekend . . . anyhoo, it's grids like this that make solving fun - and to any nut who balks at this puzzle, ""san fairy ann!""",19,positive,0.9457729458808899

Last night ‚Äî last night! ‚Äî I was out for dinner with fellow mathematicians (mostly Oberlin College profs) and complained that the Times puzzle clues COSET as ""Mathematical subgroup."" There was a chorus of No, No, No, That's just plain wrong! You need a test solver who can catch such a mathematical howler.

That entry has appeared 8 times in Shortz-era puzzle.  Five times the clue has been incorrect; twice it's been acceptably vague; the best one was ""Subdivision in group theory"" back in 2020.",49,neutral,0.344040185213089
"Nice! Like it often happens, I found the Saturday puzzle to be easier than Friday.

38A is not clued well. Given a subgroup H of a group G, you can decompose G into (left/right) cosets, and one of these cosets is indeed the subgroup H itself, but the others are not subgroups.",27,positive,0.8030434846878052

MERCY BECKETS, INFODEMIC, Ms. Kirke (LOLA), Mr. Fitch (NILES).  Needed a lot of patchwork to JURY-RIG a completed grid.

I‚Äôve always been a fan of John Guzzetta, including his jaunty photo over at Xwordinfo.  He delivers tough themeless puzzles that are always a workout for the frontal lobe.  And yet, they usually have a fresh earthiness to them, in a Weintraubuan way.  Witness NO LUCK SO FAR, DIGITAL DETOX, NEW NORMAL, LIGHTEN UP, I GOTTA RUN.

"Someone asked me earlier this week if I ever look at a puzzle and say to myself, ""I might not be able to solve this one.""

Today's puzzle almost fit into that category for a while, but I told myself to trust the process, and lo and behold, in just about a minute longer than my Saturday average, I was done.

But there were some mitigating factors:

1. I was particularly tired tonight, due to the way the day unfolded.
2. We had a house guest, to whom I was trying to talk for a while at the start of my solve, before it would be better to concentrate.
3. I started solving on my phone, always a bad idea on a Saturday, but when I went to solve undistracted, I switched to my desktop.

Maybe if none of the above had been in play, I would have felt less challenged, but in the end, it was all me, and not the puzzle, as everything is fair as far as I can tell.

The ""thanks a lot"" I know in butchered French is ""mercy buttercups""...it didn't fit.  DIGITAL DETOX was a new one on me.  Didn't know RONNIE Coleman or LOLA Kirke.
