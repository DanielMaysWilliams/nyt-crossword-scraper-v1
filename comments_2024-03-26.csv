After solving the puzzle, it was a truly ‚ÄúD‚Äôoh!‚Äù moment for me in not appreciating, until I read Sam‚Äôs Wordplay column, the constructors‚Äô brilliance in using the homonymic phrase ‚Äî there probably never was such a thing until now ‚Äî ‚Äúad hominem‚Äù as a stand-in for ‚Äúadd homonym‚Äù.

Tsk, tsk on Sam for virtually splitting an infinitive: ‚ÄúHow to not‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúHow not to‚Äù.

Sorrey to all you American folk, but as one of this crowd has already correctly pointed out, ‚Äústory‚Äù is not how you spell the word that describes one of several levels of a building (or of anything else, for that matter).  ‚ÄúStorey‚Äù it is and you will always lose two marks for a spelling error when I am grading your test paper.  I don‚Äôt care what your story is in defence (not ‚Äúdefense‚Äù) of your carelessness or ignorance.

This reprimand will no doubt annoy many of you, in the same way I was upset with my high school Latin teacher who gave me 98 by taking two marks off my spring exam paper for translating ‚Äúwood‚Äù as ‚Äúsilvae‚Äù instead of ‚Äúsilva‚Äù.

"Good Tuesday joy! As a person who loves an ad hominem attack, as long as it's not directed at me or anyone I respect, like or love, I don't think they're all fallacious. Sometimes a person is simply so odious that going all A-hom on them is totally reasonable & rational. 

Crazy, but I actually knew Laura Dershewitz's name as an author of one of my grand-niece's favorite books: ""The House That Cleaned Itself: The True Story of Frances Gabe's (Mostly) Marvelous Invention"" -- a kid's book that came out a few years ago about a real inventor's madcap ideas which she turned into reality. Dershewitz is, if I remember, the main author. It's a lovely book, wonderful illustrations, and my niece, who was seven at the time we gave it to her, still references it at age nine when it's time to clean the dishes. ""I wish Frances Gabe were here to help!"" I recommend it for the kids in your life.

Second favorite nun joke (one of many variations):

A woman joins a convent that requires a vow of silence, allowing nuns only two spoken words a decade.

Ten years pass. The nun tells the Mother Superior, ""Room cold."" They give her a heater.

Ten more years go by and she says, ""Bed hard."" They give her a new mattress.

Ten more years go by. ""Food bad."" They change her DIET PLAN.

Wait, that‚Äôs straw man.

Ski jumping need.

From what the roadies load and unload for small venue gigs.

Paid spot in the NYT.

"Anybody else get to the revealer, misread the answer as ""add HOM in 'em"", then spend precious minutes figuring out how an extra three letters into the theme entries, only to have a forehead slap moment at apparently not reading the word ""phonetic""?

"This is one of my most favorite early week puzzles of the year. I was smiling throughout the whole solve. Such a clever theme and what a great revealer. 

I surely thought the ‚ÄúFocus of a geologist or music reviewer‚Äù was rock. Great fakeout on that one. 

I especially like ‚ÄúPro for the pirates?‚Äù AYE and ‚ÄúLike checks and balances?‚Äù PLURAL.

Congratulations, Laura and Katherine!",47,positive,0.97775799036026
