"I enjoyed this puzzle, the kind of slow burn I really like, where it fills in slowly & just has vistas of revelation & surprises & draws on patience to keep solving while the trick/theme is still over the horizon. A nice combo of crunch & flow, where some words/phrases challenge while others are smooth as butter, serving a purpose like those furious sweepers in curling who brush the ice to smooth the ""stone""'s flow.

I filled in the dual-clued themers w/o knowing specifically what was going on, but that's OK… only looked at/saw the 💷₩£¥ terms later in the solve… a lot of pleasant, mild ""ahas"" as clever clues led to fine fill. I thought the puzzle was strong enough to allow for a mild-green-painty answer like LEERER (RIPER too was a bit, er, ripe). Went back to suss out the theme, was pleased at the dual answers. Very nice.

The golden ticket waited for me to see I had SOBe for SOBA (had udon 1st), I knew ADeIR didn't quite look right, so I fixed it.

Was quite surprised (not offended at all, just raised an eyebrow like Spock) at 'LMFA0'. ""NYT"" must stand for ""Not Your Tante's"" xword answer, I guess.

So I got the theme but didn't realize till the column that the title (which for once I checked before starting, yay!) meant TURN RIGHT at the money words, ha! So many layers. Like a nice SEVEN-layer chocolate pumpkin mint caramel strawberry cheesecake.

"It's a good theme which itself is well executed, though once I got it (and did not actually get they were all currencies till I read the puzzle title after I finished) it was almost too easy.  It does get frustrating to see so many relatively obscure proper names that if you don't know them and the crosses are iffy, it's easy to get one square wrong--I think this was a record number of wrong squares to fix after I filled this puzzle.  Interestingly of the fill I flagged as either obscure or kind of poor (not ""in the language"" as it were) almost all were down entries. 9D, 19D, 38D 48D, 63D, 78D, 100D, 102D.  Plus 45A.  Plus probably some others I didn't remark because I happened to know them.  It's a lot even for a Sunday.  Plus SHEDDED and LEERERS both really bother me grammatically.  And NOES.  LEERERS doesn't even make it through the NYT comment spell checker! And the clue for it is kind of weird.  So not my fave today, not the kind of challenge I like to have that is mostly trying to pick up a proper name I don't know on crosses or guess what odd word has been shoe-horned in to make the puzzle work.

A few clue quibbles:

Amex doesn’t have a gladiator in its logo. As someone else pointed out it’s a centurion. 

I think “enjoys” in the clue for LOAFS was unnecessarily misdirective. One needn’t enjoy doing nothing in order to loaf.

I'm a rising high school senior at Riverdale Country School in New York City. It's beyond an honor to have today's puzzle!

I'm not certain, but I'm pretty sure I thought of this theme on a Sunday night while I was sitting on the red chair in my living room trying not to do my homework, although, admittedly, that's how I come up with most of my puzzles. I sent this grid in with a bit of trepidation — since I know a hidden word theme is a tough sell these days — I was so happily surprised when the team told me this one was going to be a yes.

I want to thank the editing team, especially Wyna Liu and Tracy Bennett, for giving me kind and thoughtful feedback on my puzzles. Most of all, thank you to Andrew Kingsley for being the best cruciverbal partner-in-crime (and English teacher!) in potentially the history of cruciverbal partners-in-crime.

"This nearly broke me (that’s a compliment!). I had to set the puzzle down and hit “replay” on Netflix’s ambient “Fireplace for Your Home” video three whole times to keep the cozy crossword ambiance going before I finally got my gold star, which means this took almost 3 hours. No lookups, though I was tempted. 

I got the money theme immediately and filled in those circles first, but I didn’t see those splintered-off answers until I read the column after solving. Those clues weren’t even the ones I was struggling with, so this still would have been a challenge even if I’d noticed that gimmick. 

Some sticky moments:
REDADAIR—I feel silly that this is a recurring bit of crossword trivia and I didn’t know it right away. I had it filled in a such for a while, but kept waffling on nED vs. RED and testing various random letters in his surname until it was clear my “so close!” errors were elsewhere.

AMEXCARD—this took *forever* to click. I kept wanting a place name, something with “land” at the end. Big “duh” moment once I got some crosses in. The whole middle area was full of uncertainty; I also had LEERERS for a while but it never felt right, even though it was.

DOGIE—Though all the crosses confirmed it couldn’t be anything else, I did not know this bummer of a word and I look forward to forgetting it immediately.

My father coached him in high school and as a result I got to meet him at Yankee Stadium and get a signed photo and baseball card, which I still have.  He was a classy guy who passed away too young last January.  How he ended up in a puzzle by a college freshman some 40 years after his playing career ended is perplexing and wonderful.

Looking forward to more from this brilliant young constructor!",57,positive,0.9698761105537415

"This was a quite a feat of construction. 

We have five across entries with circled letters that:
(1) are all currencies
(2) can be alternately clued as an English word or a surname 
(3) provide detours for five down entries 
(4) by connecting them to the endings of five other down entries
(5) each of which is to the right.

Well dome, Garrett.",30,neutral,0.5914725661277771
"I looked at the title, 
then at the clue for the first (NW) circles, 
then entered all five circle themers. 
Then I looked at 3D, 
saw the split clue, 
entered the straight down entry, 
then went ""Right on the Money"" 
(that's my military right, Steve L.), 
then realized I needed to turn the other way 
(also right; go figure) to finish. 
Then I did the same for the other themers. 
Then I filled in the rest of the puzzle. 

A very clever construction 
from our young but non-novice 
and well-tutored constructor. 
I wish it hadn't been so easy to solve, 
but Sundays can't be everything to everyone. 

I hope all of you had fun.",9,neutral,0.6289259195327759
"To sum my “solve without knowing the theme:”

“Two roads diverged in a puzzle, and I—
I took the one most traveled by,
And that has made none the difference.”

Interesting puzzle. I had no idea that there was a theme connected with some of the down clues until I read the blog. Maybe that's why I finished in half my average time.,5,positive,0.8813337087631226
"Regarding 85A, is that really a CHIASMUS example in the clue?  My understanding is that it’s an antimetabole.   

Overall, great Sunday workout.  Loved the theme and enjoyed the fresh approach.  Thanks, Garrett!",6,neutral,0.7248048782348633

"Not much slack in this one, with or without the theme, and lots of AHAs when the lights came on.  I HADAGOODTIME, despite there being times when I was afraid I was going to have to EATDIRT.  It was a COMMANDING GAMUT of all kinds of info and I wondered how he knew about, for instance, REDADAIR.  A gimme for me, but I was alive when that brilliant firefighter was making headlines.  

All this from one who, like Tut, might also be still a TEEN.

Thanks, Garrett.

"Wow, this kid is fantastic. I'm wondering if he's related to the bookseller Richard Chalfin, it can't be that common a name, maybe it's the kid's grandfather. Richard used to zoom around Manhattan in a motorcycle, looking pretty hip, like the young Lou Reed, in his battered leather jacket and jaunty helmet, always with sachels stuffed with old books. What a character, which might explain where Garrett might have acquired some of the old man's daredevil insouciance. 

""Human Being and Citizen,"" which Caitlin reports Garrett is studying at the University of Chicago, is part of the college's ""core curriculum,"" and comprises a selection of courses in the humanities designed to introduce young minds to philosophy, political science, literature, the classics, and a course or two that the kids get to choose. The courses are usually small seminars of 20-30 students and are taught by distinguished full professors, and not just some random PhD candidate. It's a curriculum whose basic format hasn't changed for decades, and many of the smartest kids in the world, who are truly excited about reading Plato's The Republic or De Tocqueville on democracy, get turned on to the joys of learning and the free exchange of ideas. 

I, with my talent for BS, slipped into the U of C in the early 80s, but I wasn't mature enough to shoulder the workload as well as carefully tend my growing libido and love of alcohol, so left after a year, and life went on. But Garrett, man, it's clear to me, you rock!",31,positive,0.8529337048530579
