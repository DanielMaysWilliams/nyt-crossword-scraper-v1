"Even though the verb thing at 17A bothered me too once I knew the revealer, I did think this was a very cute theme -- and one that happily couldn't be guessed at in advance. Or at least not by me.  What's more, to get that sort of grid symmetry when you have a dense theme AND such limited theme options -- well, that's really amazing.  This is the sort of puzzle where one imagines the constructor leaping out of bed and crying ""Eureka!  Got it!!""

Speaking of constructors:  As a sometime constructor myself, I find this puzzle encouraging. I'll explain. It's Tuesday, but the cluing is quite imaginative in many places: NEIGH, ECHO; GNU; OCTET; ALOHAS; EGGS; BAIL; and especially COIN.  I've always worried that if I come up with a theme that's ""only"" Tuesday-level, my clues will be dumbed down, so I try to come up with themes that are definitely late-week candidates.  This makes me feel that an early-week puzzle might be satisfying to create too.

"Well, my moment of revelation in this puzzle was massive, and I earned it.

I left the revealer blank and didn‚Äôt read its clue, but uncovered the four theme answers, and tried to guess what that revealer was.  I tried everything ‚Äì first words, last words, initials of the words in the phrases, commonalities, double letters, words backwards ‚Äì and nothing came. All roads led to nothing.  

So, I admitted defeat, uncovered the revealer, and KAPOW!  A true OMG moment, where I thought, ‚ÄúOh how clever!  How perfect!‚Äù  One of those once-in-a-blue-moon Crosslandia moments where a puzzle blindsides you in the best way.  

Here, it was a riddle that after my best efforts I couldn‚Äôt solve, and I‚Äôm actually glad I didn‚Äôt because of the pure revelatory pleasure of that KAPOW!

Oh, I liked the SETS down, the woody cross of PINE and TEAK, and the parade of schwa-enders led by three jazz greats (ELLA, ETTA, DINAH, SHIVA, ELIZA, TUNA, MECHA).

"For those of you who don't consume enough anime to remember MECHA but who are big fans of wackadoo alt-rock band The Flaming Lips, I've a trick to share that has been working for me lately: their 2002 album ""Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots"", which is said to be a metaphor for a Japanese woman's battle with cancer.

From a recent, glowing review in The Lazer Guided Reporter (capitalization m-phasis mine):

""There is an augmented vibe that ties the whole album together, as a way of illustrating the MECHA universe that acts as the stage for Yoshimi‚Äôs battle with disease. Unit 3000‚Äì21 opens its eyes in ‚ÄòOne More Robot/Sympathy 3000‚Äì21‚Äô, and in the background of some strangely happy sounding lyrics ABOUT A ROBOT developing emotive capabilities, there is a constant flow of glitchy radio fuzz, and those augmented vibes and sounds that prevent any of these tracks from falling into the pop realm. Towards the end of 3000‚Äì21‚Äôs bouncing story, these monotone noises are the only things left and they bring us back to the uncertainty that surrounds Yoshimi and her future.""

If I can attach a difficult to remember word to something important to me, it instantly becomes easier to retrieve and deploy. Cheers.

Omaha over combat vehicles caused an ECHO of D-Day, Omaha Beach, the vehicles mainly landing craft.
