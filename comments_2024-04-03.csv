"I shouldn't have started this puzzle so late last night because I made some bone-headed errors that really tripped me up. 

As soon as I read the Lip_on produc_s clue, I popped in Ice T and figured I'd get the rest of the answer on crosses and moved on.

Then, embarrassing as this is to confess, I had a major duh in the NE where I put REsolE in. ü´£ Yeah, I know the word sole is actually in the clue... ü§Ø 

Nothing made sense with the crosses that those caused and I hung on for ridiculously long until lunchtime today when I decided to blow up those two corners and rework them. Got them fixed almost INSTANTly with proper-ish sleep and nutrition. 

The theme and the rest of the grid came together nicely for me except what was impacted by my BUMBL(ing). But now my SMILING EYES are errr, well, they're smiling again! 

Especially enjoyed the clues for EGGS and CASINO and appreciated that NICENE and PAUL came to me right away. My theology profs from back in the day would be so proud!

"Something about EGGS for ""Animal crackers?"" rubs me the wrong way.

I get it -- eggs come from animals, and you crack an egg.

But ""Animal crackers?"" implies either that the answer is a type of animal that cracks, or that ""cracker"" is a type of object and we're looking for the animal variety.

The former would have an answer like ""chick"" -- that it cracks the egg from within as it hatches. But the answer is ""eggs"", and it seems like a stretch too far to call an egg a ""cracker"" just because we crack it.

Like, you'd never clue a loaf of bread a ""slicer"" (e.g. ""grainy slicer""), or a jar of pickles an ""unscrewer"" (e.g. ""briny unscrewer""). So I just don't think an egg should be clued as a ""cracker"".

Side notes: My paternal grandmother (in Kentucky) was a MEEMAW, though I had always thought of that as just MEMA.
