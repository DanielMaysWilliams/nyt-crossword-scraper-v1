"I resisted ALLEGORICAL (74D) for longer than I should because of a surfeit of litcrit education.

Allegory foregrounds its comparisons, while metaphor typically veils them.

The poets we call the Moderns loved metaphor, particularly very dense concealed metaphor where the topic was only implied and there was great room for ambiguity in interpretation. They typically disliked allegory, because it smacks you in the face with its stinking fish of meaning.

Pilgrim's Progress, which we have encountered earlier this week, I think, is allegory.  Frost's ""Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"" is an extended metaphor.",4,negative,0.5435460209846497

"What a joyful jazzy dance of a puzz. If I had to make a wish on an eyelash a half hour ago, it would have been for a puzzle like this, so funny and charming in a 1950s Damon Runyon kinda way, and it's been retroactively granted.  I caught myself humming:

you say axolotl
I say axolatl

you say llano
I say llana

llano
llana
Ella
Elsa
Odesa
Odessa!

Let's fill in the answer: RIPS OFF!

I just loved the gay atmosphere of the whole thing, like living in a breezy campy Guys 'n', well, Guys musical, between bi flag and gaydar up top, God save the queen down below and six inch or foot long (wink) in the middle, how befitting, where the good cop and bad cop consort the loan shark, a shady TRIO, where please be seated offers a pew to the arse directly beneath, where the crime boss smiles as he sits on the bride's side of the aisle, rejoicing in how his bribe has paid off; if it hadn't, well, meet my friend Mr. Zeta from Etna here, he's handy with an axe they tell me, and me, I'll be happy to visit you in the hospital, autograph your cast, you get what I'm sayin'?

where the confession the bad cop finally elicits is ""Guilty as charged! Now tell me I'm pretty."" Where sip that martini & digest that olive joggling at the bottom of it are foremost on the crime boss's mind, if he had to make a wish right then.",49,positive,0.9196919798851013

"SCHED wasn't one of my favorite entries either, Daniel, but I'll take one or two you STUNKAT for the quite pleasant overall effort. Luckily ""Timetable: Abbr."" is a hint; it would not do as a definition in one of my prior lines of work.

A timetable is the authority for the movement of regular trains subject to the rules and special instructions. 

A schedule is that part of a timetable which prescribes class, direction, number and movement for a regular train.

99D. I’m a sucker for a good homophone like this: “School name that sounds like a Canadian territory.” The correct solution is UCONN, which sounds like Yukon, in wordplay that is really fun even though it’s not as showy as Manitoba or Saskatchewan.

Manitoba and Saskatchewan are provinces, not territories, so I'm having Nunavut.
