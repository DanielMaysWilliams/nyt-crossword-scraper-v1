"I have to say it‚Äôs really frustrating when someone is complaining about struggling through an unusually high amount of trivia / proper nouns / obscure trivia in a particular crossword, to then get responses in the comments about how so-and-so has been clued 545 times since 1905. Like okay, sure, but are NYT crosswords only to be solved by people who have solved 544 other crosswords? What about us newbies, I guess tough luck with our crossword struggles then? Jeez.

These comments aren‚Äôt helpful and to be honest come across a bit smug. The other day someone said they weren‚Äôt buying the (hundreds of) complaints about done unusually tough crossings because some of those words had appeared so often in previous crosswords. I guess we all conspired across the globe to complain on the same crossword then. 

To be clear, not saying all crosswords should be easy necessarily, I‚Äôve certainly learned a ton over my 78-day-and-counting streak so far. But some of these complaints are legitimate as evidenced by the number of recommends many of them get, and a little empathy or kinder guidance from more experienced folks would help a ton.

The only thing that held me up for a moment was that I forgot AGGRO had two g's. 

But when crosswords have a lot of sports references or pop music and TV from certain of my misspent decades, I am sunk. On those, I can spend a couple of hours or more after getting the 'Something's Amiss' message trying to figure out how to cheat within my personal parameters of cheatingness.

"I'm going to agree with the rest of the pitchfork wielders on this one, unfortunately.  The clueing was a stretch on multiple entries (NERTS, really?), and some just plain wrong (Jung, SSGTS). The advent of Google has not been a friend to crossword creators and solvers alike, as I'm convinced it makes it easier for creators to find any feasible clue for whatever mess of letters may be left in a tough spot, no matter how obscure. Creators should abide by the same unwritten code of honor that solvers live by...if you used the internet to create (or solve) a crossword, it's not a true win. Some might disagree with me on this, but you know it's true ;-)  Anyone can Google their way to a gold star completion.

And for the ""Stan"" answer, I'm young enough (or old enough, depending on perspective) to remember when this song came out. I had the album, and am very familiar with the song. Still didn't get the answer, because it was a bad clue...plain and simple. The thought that it might be ""Stan"" crossed my mind for a split second due to the cross answers, but then I said to myself ""no way they'd reference a 24-year old obscure song without any reference to Eminem, music, or even a question mark.

The clue would do better to read US Air Force or Marines.

Furthermore, though it doesn‚Äôt appear in this puzzle, I‚Äôd like to take issue with the use of ‚ÄúNONCOM‚Äù meaning non-commissioned officer.

Those are just random samples. Almost all of the hundreds listed are just as bizarre and baffling. The book is on Amazon in digital form if you're interested for very little money (I think maybe $2).

To most, KRAKEN will conjure the line ""Release the Kraken!"" from the film *Clash of the Titans*.

"Another unusually long workout for me. A number of complete unknowns as clued, and I really didn't entirely tumble to the theme until after I was done and went back and reviewed.

Side note regarding 64a. A SSGT is an E-6. During my time in the service, I don't ever recall seeing an E-6 commanding a squad - it was always an E-5 (Which is just SGT). In fact, during my time, uh.... overseas my squad got trimmed down to a point where we just referred to it as - ""the four of us."" And all of us were just getting paid as E-4's. No time for sergeants. 

And then back in the states after my tour, I was for a while the enlisted man leader of a platoon. That would normally be a ""platoon sergeant"" (E-7), but I was getting paid as... an E-4 (which is sometimes a corporal).

Sorry for the drift. Really fun puzzle find today that I'll put in a reply.

"Raise hands if you thought it would be icily instead of DRILY.  I juggled the NE corner so much I was afraid I would drill a hole in my laptop.  My first fill was MOOLA, but I took it out three or four seconds later because it was so obviously not going to work. Then, because I didn't read the clue carefully, I had MADMAn.  SEn was a real head scratcher, but I just thought hey, what do I know anyway.  MADMAX is a great favorite, so when I finally reread the clue and saw the fill that made it SEX, well, I was relieved to see that there was some hope for finishing the puzzle, which I did, finally.

There were a lot of perky clues in the puzzle‚Äîsome hard for me and some easy (like NERTS, which I think must be regional/generational slang, long since gone out of fashion, but my brothers said it all the time when I was a kid).
  
The solve was stop and go for me, which I always like, because it means the puzzle is not too easy and not too hard‚Äîlike Goldilocks' porridge: Just right.

"Okay, I've never done this before. For the record I probably won't solve the puzzle until morning's coffee. But I made a comment late yesterday and a few folks asked for details and I didn't see those requests until REALLY late, so here goes, hopefully in a place it will be seen. And yes it's Off Topic, but it's in reply to something which was On Topic, albeit yesterday.

in the 2000s I was at the center of an NLRB action; I was the main target of a venue which didn't want my union involved. To plead our case I was asked to submit a trove of emails .  At the NLRB hearing I was asked why my two bosses (not the targets of the investigation) repeatedly called me Vlad in the emails when it was clearly not my name. I had to explain to the PTB* that my middle initial is V, and I was a big fan of Buffy (the vampire slayer). I quoted the show often at work (come on, it remains eminently quotable: ""could you vague that up for me?"" remains in heavy rotation) and I would often say things like ""well, what would Buffy do?"" or ""Giles would have handled that differently"" or ""that's exactly what Cordelia would have said"". So my nickname became Vlad The Impaler--amusing in a very small group of workmates, but difficult to explain in a hearing. :\  So thanks for listening.
