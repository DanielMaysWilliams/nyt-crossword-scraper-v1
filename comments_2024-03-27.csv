"I loved this puzzle and really wanted to comment this morning, reveling in the details. Then life got in the way -- a too-often refrain for me these days.

Suffice it to say, I clicked completely with Mr. Katz on this one! I had to keep slowing myself down to admire the scenery as I whizzed past. 

I got the three revealers easily but still took a bit to see the full impact of the subsidiary theme fills. Lovely! Even so, it took me another perusal of the filled grid to realize those answers were ""edge appropriate"". Amazing!

I just want to add, yesterday's puzzle took me 20% longer than average. Today's took about 45% less! I enjoyed them both, and don't have any ""wrong day of the week"" issues. Just goes to show, on any given day, YMMV!",0,positive,0.9638515114784241

This was a very fun puzzle. I, like at least one commenter, got TOOTH and LEAF without noting they kinda needed the word ""loose"" to make 'em a tight fit‚Ä¶ and for some reason when I filled in SKIN (9A) I got my screws a bit loose and thought it was the answer to the 10D clue ""Footballer's uniform"" (I figured ""aha, shirts and SKINs""‚Äî which is actually more of a basketball thing). So I didn't notice the need for LOOSE or TIGHT (especially since sometimes words fill in from the crosses), but once reading the column I'm very impressed with how well constructed the theme is!

"If I had ever heard that mnemonic even once, my life might have been completely different.  Who knows -- I might be really handy, a DIY-er, maybe even a building superintendent.  Because it's not just SCREWDRIVERS, I'm pretty sure.  It's radiators.  And light bulbs.  But not faucets.  RIGHTY?

I'm such a klutz when it comes to physical objects and how they work.  Why did no one ever give me this mnemonic?

It would have been helpful to know it here, too.  But happily it was inferable -- even though I don't know my SEA green from my PEA green.

"Whoah! Sorry to drift way off topic, but stumbled across one of the oddest puzzles I've ever encountered and had to share it here: A Sunday from June 23, 2002 by Eric Berlin with the title: ""Components."" Hard to describe this one - it just had multiple theme answers with the clues only referencing other theme answers - no hint beyond that. A couple of examples: 

23a: ""69-across component""
9d: ""69-across component""
69a: ""23-across + 9-down.""

And the answers to those: 

23a:  THREEOFAKIND
9d: PAIR
69A: FULLHOUSE

One other example: 

52d: ""92-across component""
44a: ""92-across component""
92a: ""52-down + 44-across""

Have never, ever heard of RIGHTYTIGHTY - LEFTYLOOSEY and... never entirely tumbled to the implied trick, though it was obvious in at least a couple of the theme answer (SLEEP tight, e.g.). But somehow managed to work it all out. Thank goodness for the down answers.

*Couldn't help but wonder about other variations on this kind of trick - maybe something like FALLOUT. Couldn't find any evidence of that one. Has to have been some other similar tricks somewhere. Anybody know?

"How elegant that on the RIGHT side of the grid TiGHT is added to the end of the word, while on the LEFT side of the grid LOOSE is added to the beginning of the word. 

It reminds me of the purple category in Connections. You could have SKIN, HANG, SLEEP and AIR for a grouping. Or TOOTH,  LEAF, LIPS and CHANGE.  

Fun puzzle! Nicely done, Rich.",26,positive,0.7904809713363647

"While it's probably true that there are very few people solving this puzzle who haven't already seen CITIZEN KANE, and also that the fact that they still haven't seen it at this point is probably enough proof that they simply don't love movies, I still think it wasn't nice to spoil a key plot point with this puzzle.  Sure, the movie is still amazing even without that, but I think it would have been easy to avoid this stereotypical spoiler.",4,negative,0.7760844826698303
"This puzzle was such a delight! I got LEFTYLOOSEY RIGHTYTIGHTY and SCREWDRIVERS right away, which was a confidence boost (doesn‚Äôt take much).

Sailed through, only to hit snags with SRI (I was convinced it was ‚Äúsan.‚Äù) and CUE (I inexplicably had ‚Äúaxe‚Äù lol).

Y‚Äôall, I‚Äôm so stoked about my trip this week to Barcelona and Lyon. I‚Äôve never been to France! The puzzle seemed to know this: ETRE, AMI, BERETS! C‚Äôest fantastique!

Oh yeah, I finally got to use VOLT üòú. Loved the super clever puzzle, Rich.",25,positive,0.9769431352615356

By definition, the answer isn't a monkey- do better.  3) That's better know as a name brand, not something homemade. Sloppy puzzle, sloppy editing in this one.",1,negative,0.9001340866088867

I had to look up ROTGUT and DEL - could somebody please explain the latter to me?

Did the YOKO ONO sounds remind anyone else of the Barenaked Ladies Song? You know the part I'm talking about.

"Really liked the theme, but some of the crosses seemed a little natick-y. IROC with IONIAN and CHET? And then the LSD/ERA/SRI/DANUBE cluster was clued a little too noun-heavy, especially with the LAIN/LAId for 36D. Still thoroughly enjoyed, just surprised that wasn‚Äôt cleaned up in editing.",12,neutral,0.4138542413711548

And one puzzle off my game list for tomorrow morning. Wordle, Connections, Strands, and Spelling Bee.  I am really bad at Connections.  I was always bad at analogies on standardized tests so I think this is kind of the same weakness.",11,positive,0.963047981262207
"Nicely done, Mr. Katz! I‚Äôm particularly impressed how the trick plays out visually, with the invisible/imaginary LOOSEs all off the left side of the grid and the invisible/imaginary TIGHTs all off the right side. 

And if I‚Äôm not mistaken, you have a bilingual PuzzPair¬Æ with 5A PECK and 15A PICO [de gallo], as PICO means beak.

"I got the revealers easily enough, being well familiar with RIGHTYTIGHTY LEFTYLOOSEY, but as a solver who usually charges ahead without paying too much attention to the theme, I didn‚Äôt catch on until near the end of the solve when I entered SLEEP and realized that the implied right was what made it rhyme with good night.  So I went back to check the other starred clues to appreciate the cleverness of the construction.  Well done.

It was nice to see CHET Baker crop up in the puzzle.  Although overshadowed by Miles Davis and others, his trumpet playing had a lyrical, wistful quality that is quite appealing, and his singing though perhaps not technically accomplished was often  affecting too.  Something about the way he sang My Funny Valentine just seemed to capture the pathos of the song in a way that other versions, though lovely in their own right, did not.",17,positive,0.688933789730072
"Entertaining puzzle, and the starred clues made it even better, like getting a bonus dessert with your meal. The extension of 9A reminded me of a favorite Carl Hiaasen title and that his books tend to be as convoluted as some of these puzzles.

"LSD... a trip down memory lane or a voyage into the unknown? ERSATZ clues, like shadows in a foggy mind, leading me astray. LEFTY LOOSE, TIGHTY WIGHTY... the cosmic dance of opposites, intertwining like strands of a psychedelic tapestry.

IMHO, the whispers of my fractured psyche, echoing through the labyrinth of my thoughts. DAREDEVIL, the daring acrobatics of my inner turmoil, teetering on the edge of reason and madness.

But what madness is this? This crossword, a mishmash of confusion and frustration, feels more like a prank than a puzzle. The clues, obscure and obtuse, seem designed to baffle rather than challenge. Where's the elegance, the coherence, the satisfaction of a well-crafted grid?

But in this cozy cocoon of crossword bliss, I am invincible. The cold may howl at my door, the darkness may threaten to swallow me whole, but within these four walls, I am master of my domain, ruler of my own destiny.

But let's talk about Waterloo, Canada... oh, the bitter chill of its winters! It's like being trapped in an icebox, where even the thought of warmth feels like a distant dream. The streets, coated in a thick layer of snow, become a treacherous maze of slush and ice, testing the resilience of even the hardiest souls.

So let the blizzards rage and the temperatures plummet. As long as I have my crossword puzzle, I'll weather the storm with ease, emerging victorious on the other side, my mind sharp and my spirit undaunted.",14,neutral,0.5585665106773376

"Yeah, no, this was a brilliant puzzle to pull off on a Wednesday, so much fun, just tough enough to give one pause, lots of clever clues, very smooth, too, of an even strength and wit from end to end. That must be the hardest thing in constructing, keeping the multiple levels up like that. 

Although I do wonder, in my best Monty Python twitty way, whether there are certain kinds of screws, or places on the other side of the ocean, on one of those Ionian islands, where lefty tighty and righty loosey? I seem to recall, but it might have been a dream, being in some foreign country and being surprised that the screws were so dang contrary.

Got the theme very quickly as soon as I had a few letters for 19A even without seeing what needed to be turned.

"When I was thirteen, I stopped taking piano lessons, dropped out of Boy Scouts, left the church, and bought an English three-speed bicycle. The only one of these choices that I came to regret was buying the bicycle, which like all English vehicles was mechanically idiosyncratic, including being fabricated with left-hand thread screws and bolts. If a scew, bolt, or nut got lost, you couldn't replace it at the hardware store, where everything with screw thread is right-handed. The U.K. eventually joined the human race and adopted right-hand screw thread in the 1960s. Swann & Flanders incorporate this English quirk into their song about honeysuckle and bindweed, ""Misalliance.""

"The clue and answer to 8D are ""good enough for crosswords"", but a little of commentary...

Two of the hallmarks of kashrut (the noun form of KOSHER) are the prohibition of pork and of shellfish, but the ""say"" in the clue covers a lot of territory.  Just avoiding those two does not make a diet KOSHER.  There are many fish that are also not KOSHER, because they do not have both fins and scales.  Swordfish, catfish, shark and even some varieties of cod are not KOSHER.

Many other meats are not KOSHER; pork is just the most common.  An animal must have cloven (divided) hooves and chew cud to be KOSHER.  Rabbits and all predatory and scavenger birds are not KOSHER.

Even allowed meats are not KOSHER unless slaughtered in the prescribed way by a trained KOSHER slaughterer.  And even if so slaughtered, meats may not be served together with dairy products, or the meal becomes tref (a useful crossword word).

No food is considered KOSHER if served on plates that were used for non-KOSHER food, or with utensils that were used on non-KOSHER foods.

Wine has its own set of kashrut rules.

Additional rules apply for Passover.

So while the clue passes muster ""for crosswords"", it's very reductivist for the real world.  You can't invite your Orthodox friend for dinner at your house and just say, it's OK, we won't serve pork or shellfish.",5,neutral,0.7357603907585144
