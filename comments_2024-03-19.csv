But most important -- long-timers here will remember that I get all pedantic about the differences between true seals and SEA LIONs. This clue got it right! I would have gritted my teeth and grudgingly accepted the answer, had it been ""SEAL"" but I wouldn't have liked it. 

The classic, barking ""SEAL"" you see at a circus is not a true SEAL, but a SEA LOIN. 

I suppose some of the sounds SEALs make could be interpreted as barks, but not nearly as clearly a barking sound as a SEA LION. SEALs typically make a bit of a growling sound, with a great deal of rasp to it. Think of what Henry Kissinger would have sounded like if he were to produce a low growling sound. All that vocal fry!

An anecdotal aside.

A tier in this alien world is a stubborn and unpredictable enormous bird. Their wings are large and covered with soft feathers but almost completely useless.

But for long-time puzzle buffs, this puzzle doesn't even need a revealer. We all know what a DOOK is and I found this puzzle absolutely delightful.  And I was SO slow getting the trick because I didn't see it at MAIN DRAG.  ""What on earth?"" I'm thinking.  Saw the light at DOOR NAILS, after which I went back to MA IN DRAG and said: ""How clever!""  I then guessed the next two themers with very few crosses.

I knew some of the words others seem to have struggled with (EPAULET, SPOOR, and even SKOR - I have previous NYT puzzles to thank for that, because that product is unknown in Poland, or maybe even Europe).

What gave me problems were ENID (I sadly know next to nothing about either Oklahoma or Tennyson, and that corner gave me trouble in general, so I had no crosses to help me; I ended up looking ENID up - my only google search of the day) and EASTER. In the end I realized the clue referred to an Easter egg hunt, but it occured to me late because it is not a thing here, or at least nobody had heard of it when I was a child.

The Polish Easter-time tradition is to go have a traditional food basket blessed by a Catholic priest at church, and given its religious nature me and my family of atheists never engaged in it. Not quite as fun as an egg hunt, eh? I once went with my then-girlfriend to have her basket blessed and all I got was holy water in my eyes - the priest was apparently bent on blessing everybody and everything in the room, not just the eggs and sausages. He might as well have turned on the overhead sprinklers. The thing priests use for the purpose - a thing like a small broomstick, basically - is apparently called an aspergillum in English.

I spoke with The Times‚Äôs senior puzzle editor, Joel Fagliano, about Ms. Lempel, whom he called ‚Äúa pro in every aspect of crossword making.‚Äù ‚ÄúOne of Lynn‚Äôs hallmarks, in my book, is just very to-the-point, interesting and engaging clue writing,‚Äù Mr. Fagliano said. ‚ÄúThis was an easy edit.‚Äù

Heck, in a minute I'll be reciting ""The Shooting of Dan McGrew"" if you don't watch out.

*Yes, I do feel a sense of potential future self loathing for having written ""zhuzh,"" but I also refuse to replace the word. It deserves its short, ugly life in our tongue.",44,positive,0.6436100006103516
"Perhaps our Londoners will contradict me, but I think the clue at 36A makes the classic mistake of thinking Big Ben is the clock, when it is in fact the bell in the clock tower.

"That was fun.  A perfect Tuesday‚Äîno empty filling for this tasty puzzle, and some delightful fills.  How long would it take to collect all those what-ever-they're-called to have enough for a puzzle theme.  I sailed through the puzzle, enjoying every second of it, and sorry that it was over so quickly.

Thank you, Lynn Lempel.  GO ON, SQUAD was inspired.",19,positive,0.9650920629501343

"I thought this one had some good WORDSMITHing, and I found the themed answers delightful.  As is often the case I got them from context and didn‚Äôt see how the first four letters of each made two two letter words until I looked at my completed puzzle.  I guess I‚Äôm a little dense tonight because I don‚Äôt see how HALFTIME relates to the wordplay.

Interestingly (at least to me), all the people appearing in the puzzle, DUNCAN, ANNIE, and CAP‚ÄôN Crunch are unreal.  Well, actually, I guess Macbeth‚Äôs DUNCAN is based on a historical character.  Speaking of Macbeth, while hiking with friends in Scotland a few years back, we happened upon a country graveyard which contained a tombstone commemorating a women with the surname Macbeth.  Imagine my nerdish delight at discovering the grave of Lady Macbeth.",15,positive,0.8679003715515137
Total delight of a puzzle. The sign of a good theme is when I chuckle under my breath loud enough for my girlfriend to ask what is so funny from the other room.,24,positive,0.9678370952606201
"Maybe it‚Äôs just a sign that I‚Äôm getting old, but to me erotica and PORN are two very different things. 

The toughest moment for me was trying to figure out what word came after SEAL. Of course it had to be SEAL ION!",43,negative,0.7174126505851746
"After reading the column‚Äôs explanation of the theme, Bilbo Baggins said of the puzzle:

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.‚Äù

And I agree.

"Fun solve! This might be my first Tuesday completed without any lookups! The theme became evident to me with 36A, and I was bemused by 26A. Definitely a STRESS-free puzzle, crafted by a talented WORDSMITH :)",39,positive,0.9790756702423096
Liked the theme.  I often don't do Tuesdays but I'm glad I did today.  Clever.,8,positive,0.9774681329727173

"Re the column:

1. Either she's too young, or it's because she's Canadian, but Sam mustn't remember or know of the PSA campaign some years ago featuring (if I remember correctly) Woodsy the Owl with the tagline ""Give a hoot, don't pollute.""  In the positive form (the first part, of course).

2. I found the theme extremely easy to figure out.  I had most of the letters of 17A, including the DRAG part, and figured it was going to be MAIN DRAG before even looking at the clue.  When the clue was about a Pride parade, I immediately got that DRAG had a different meaning, and along with ""parent"" in the clue, it was easy to make the adjustment to MA IN DRAG.  The rest of them followed easily.  I don't know if Sam was actually flummoxed, or just modest.",4,neutral,0.7539046406745911
