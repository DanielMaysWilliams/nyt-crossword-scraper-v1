"Late to the comments today, but it was a fun Monday although there was a little distraction from the Lions-Rams game (which is maybe why my solve ran a bit long). LOCH dropped in readily, but I had Laze before LOAF, but correcting that didn't take long.

I did come here wondering about a different theme on this particular day. Nope - but thought it was a nice touch (wonder if it was coincidental) to at least see Arthur ASHE,  MALIAOBAMA and... especially ROSA Parks in the theme.

On that note - went and did an extended answer history search for another name. Well. MARTINLUTHERKING is 16 letters. Add JUNIOR and it's 22 letters. I could go on and on about that but, in brief... the ONLY appearance of anything close to the full name was in a Sunday puzzle from February 19, 1984 by Bert H. Kuse. The answer in that one was:
