"In Indonesian, East Timor is ""Timur Timor"", the eastern part - timor - of island Timur, abbreviated as ""TIM-TIM"".

The name Timor itself may derive from Portuguese  ""temer"" meaning ""to fear"".  Presumably the Timorese were seen as seen as pretty scary, being darker and fiercer than some other islanders -- they are more of the Melanesian type vs. Polynesian, but who knows.  The other terms for the directions in Indonesian/Malay are clearly based from the peninsula, with Indian influence:  ""south"" is ""selatan"", from ""selat' meaning ""strait"", as in the Straits of Melaka, ""north"" is ""utara"" from Sanskrit meaning ""high"" which is what the Himalayas are to the north of India, and ""west"" is ""barat"" from Sanskrit ""bharata"" meaning India itself.

"I haven't done the puzzle -- I do them in the morning. But I wanted to suggest a very interesting puzzle to everyone. The WaPo alt-Sunday crossword from two weeks ago, titled ""Loss of Down.""

There is a NFL META theme (since it came out on Super Bowl Sunday) but even a completely non-sports person like me could figure it out. It's a fairly easy meta but fun nonetheless. The grid is divided into eight separate grid and ONLY across clues are included (I know some people here try to solve puzzles using only the across clues, so they should be pleased with this one.) 

I've never seen a puzzle like this -- I hope one and all can access it and play it. 

Enjoy!

"Great puzzle, and as many, multiple other people have already repeatedly said below, very enlightening, too!  

I wonder if other languages have many instances of tautology, or if it's strictly an English thing? Seems like a decidedly American thing to do, at least.
