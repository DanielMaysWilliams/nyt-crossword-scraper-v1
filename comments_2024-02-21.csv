"In Indonesian, East Timor is ""Timur Timor"", the eastern part - timor - of island Timur, abbreviated as ""TIM-TIM"". (East Java = ""JATIM"", etc.) The Timorese call it ""Timor-Leste"" using the Portuguese, whom they hate less than the Indonesians; they were colonized longer by the former but more brutally, at least in recent times, by the latter.

The name Timor itself may derive from Portuguese  ""temer"" meaning ""to fear"".  Presumably the Timorese were seen as seen as pretty scary, being darker and fiercer than some other islanders -- they are more of the Melanesian type vs. Polynesian, but who knows.  The other terms for the directions in Indonesian/Malay are clearly based from the peninsula, with Indian influence:  ""south"" is ""selatan"", from ""selat' meaning ""strait"", as in the Straits of Melaka, ""north"" is ""utara"" from Sanskrit meaning ""high"" which is what the Himalayas are to the north of India, and ""west"" is ""barat"" from Sanskrit ""bharata"" meaning India itself.

of the attic crawl spaces in my
dusty old noodle).

But, with the crosses, all was sussed out, no look-ups, 
and I learned more than a few things!

That’s good stuff, especially on a Wednesday.

to find the correct letter to plop into that little
box.

Yup.

As a puzzle, this was plenty of a riddle for me, trying to figure out the theme, wondering what the connection was between the places and the languages in parentheses in their clues, before I got to the revealer.  

Now, after solving, I’m d’oh-ing all over the place, wondering why I didn’t figure it out.  It seems so gettable now.  But you outfoxed me fair and square, Jeffrey – and I like that almost as much as if I had figured it out.  Also, my brain enjoyed burrowing all over the place, trying to crack the riddle.

The tautologies reminded me of a professor I had who criticized a student for being “redundant and overly repetitive”, and he wasn’t making a joke!  Sometimes in life, something crosses your path that is so funny, you never forget it.

There is a NFL META theme (since it came out on Super Bowl Sunday) but even a completely non-sports person like me could figure it out. It's a fairly easy meta but fun nonetheless. The grid is divided into eight separate grid and ONLY across clues are included (I know some people here try to solve puzzles using only the across clues, so they should be pleased with this one.) 

I've never seen a puzzle like this -- I hope one and all can access it and play it. 

Enjoy!

"Just a ballet dancer complaining about 53D because no one ever says that. The correct answer would be EN POINTE or at least ON POINT(E). Added crossword fun for the french terminology.

Other than that, a wonderful puzzle full of really interesting, new trivia knowledge. A shame all of the tautology gave me flashbacks to HSC Adv. English",19,neutral,0.4945594072341919
"Great puzzle, and as many, multiple other people have already repeatedly said below, very enlightening, too!  

I wonder if other languages have many instances of tautology, or if it's strictly an English thing? Seems like a decidedly American thing to do, at least.

On top of that, I got to learn something new, adding to an already splendid experience.
I will add these tautologies to the redundant Chai tea which has previously appeared in this forum.

Thank you , Mr. Martinovic.

"Solved while wearing my sombrero hat and drinking chai tea with panini sandwiches (instead of my usual naan bread).  

Theme was singularly unique, though it went by in fast blur (stop me please).  Speaking of tautologies - are there any types of abs that are not steel?  (That’s a humorous joke).

"There was a lost opportunity to clue 11D (EST) as ""Either part of 50A in French.""

EST, in addition to meaning ""is"" in French, means ""east"".  Or, if you speak Indonesian, ""timor"".
