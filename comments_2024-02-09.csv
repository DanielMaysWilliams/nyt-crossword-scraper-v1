I usually do the puzzles after dinner while my husband does dishes (I cook....)  But then a family of 6 arrived who are staying with us until Sunday for their grandmother/great grandmother funeral.  They are all close.  Grandma was 98 last Monday, so this is a celebration.  Anyway, I forgot to go back and finish  the puzzle!

"TL;DR, This was fun, hard but fun. 

This was a challenge. I started last night in the NW, nothing entered. Moved to the NE, nothing entered. Moved to the center and entered QUE crossed with HUG, thank the crosswords Gods for three letter entries. At that point the puzzle had me captive. I actually finished most of the puzzle BELOW the top 4 rows by midnight, with only a couple of letter changes needed today. But those top 4 rows, nothing worked for me last night. Tried PSHAW in 15D, I thought it was good, wrong. Threw that out and put DINAR in 15A, nope. Was pretty sure of MEN and ISTHAT... in 5&6D, had to look up LOUIS for 7D and suddenly the NW was done. But the top 3 rows in the NE? So close with not a clue. Poked around the internet and found TUTTI and SANAA which gave me STRAW and a good laugh (I agree that the clue for STRAW seemed, um, a bit questionable). SOBS finished. Still have no idea what a BATARANG might be.",5,neutral,0.42228835821151733

I did know SANAA as soon as I had the S. So many Yemeni bodegas these days, and I love talking with the owner of my corner store. He's shown my photos of his family home in the capital -- thankfully still standing despite the war. (Filipino islands I'm less clear about!)

There were other wonderful, millenial-speak long (8+ letter) entries, including QUIET QUITTING (Guilty) and IS THAT A THING, but Ms. Stevenson still managed to throw us boomers a bone or three with BATARANG and DISCO BALL, and as soon as I read ""Traveling Wilburys"", made super by the mere--apologies to any other Wilburys, living or deceased--presence of Roy Orbison, I knew it was SUPERGROUP.

The cluing for TARANTULA was a scream, as my first association with fuzzy was wuzzy, and I was, like @sotto voce, looking for something cuddly. I shared a house with a Pharmacology PhD student who kept one, and I remember how fascinating it was to watch Mr. T spinning its silk.

The cluing for ALL AT ONCE threw me, as ""suddenly"" seemed to make better sense, but it's Friday, Jake. Expect the unexpected.

Loved ""One-sided dice"", as it's literally what ""SNAKE EYES"" are. I mean figuratively.

I could quibble about HIERARCHAL, but I'll leave that to the Carperazzi to complain.

Hadn't heard a scuba tank & regulator called am AQUALUNG since Lloyd Bridges in ""Sea Hunt"". (boomer ref.)

It's like the answers were coming to me out of thin air, with misdirects quickly grasped, expressions falling into my head from the sky, and crosses revealing all the unknowns. 
A very astonishing experience, a perfect dance of delight and disbelief, which I wish sincerely upon all.

The funny part of the solve was when ""Fuzzy"" had me thinking fuzzy-wuzzy, soft and cuddly, and... whaaat? No! TARANTULA!?!
Thank you, Ms. Iverson, for this  laugh-out-loud moment and for a cloud nine solving experience I won't soon forget.",14,positive,0.617274820804596
"I wish the app had an inactivity time out. Now that I think about it, does the (Android) app disable a smart phone from turning off?  Solving after a long day I sometimes nod off while contemplating a clue with my eyes closed, only to wake up some time later to find an hour has gone by.  Finished in 1:23. Oh well I'm not a rapid solver, and don't really care but that's well over my Friday average.",8,neutral,0.6475204825401306
Shout out to Deb for plugging the ‚Äòwalk away‚Äô strategy. I‚Äôd love to know how and why it works but a lot of times it just does.,13,neutral,0.49757376313209534
This is just a great puzzle. Difficult and enjoyable so that it felt like a perfect Friday.,11,positive,0.9841552972793579
Loved the clue for 10D so much. What a fun variety of possibilities that teenagers and pasta could share! Allowed myself some time to explore ideas without the aid of crossing answers. First thought was CURLY. Then BAKED.,13,positive,0.9728829264640808
"I kept thinking, I'm not getting anywhere with this, it's not possible.  But I kept putting in the fills (and taking them out again), staring at the gaps, asking IS THAT A THING?  Ready to cry UNCLE. At last I had to come to the column and PLOW into it.  Happily, that answered the last question, and ALL AT ONCE, QUIETLY QUITTING, I was done! ALL SMILES!  What fun it was!  What a SUPER GROUP of clues.  

Thank you, Christina, for this challenging puzzle.  I had a BALL.",14,negative,0.4836863875389099
"The SW corner doubled my time.

Sensing a mini-theme with 41a Pops led to daDMeN,
(seemed clever to me at the time),
and 47a as poPupGROUP.

CUREDmeat and TutS vs TSKS plus SNObS 
added to the ArRay of repeated clear and try again errors.

No complaints.",7,neutral,0.6320240497589111
"Another fine puzzle with a lot of musical connections from LOUIS and the Good Book, to SUPERGROUPs, FLUTESOLOs, DISCOBALLs, and The Worst PIES In London, so I sailed by this one.  There were lots of fun non musical clues too.

I was privileged to have seen a production of Sweeney Todd  with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury while honeymooning in NYC a lifetime ago.  Her performance of Worst PIES was to die for.",22,positive,0.9542912840843201
"Had a lot of fun with most of this puzzle but the marquis entry left a bad taste in my mouth. The idea that someone who is ‚Äújust‚Äù doing the job that they have been hired to do instead of going above and beyond (in other words, throwing in some unpaid labor) is quitting has always been troubling to me. If a company is looking for more from a role, then they should build those expectations into the job description and compensate accordingly.",12,negative,0.7226468324661255
"The clue for FLUTE SOLO held me up for a few minutes; it‚Äôs a wonderful bit of misdirection.

QUIET QUITTING and Addison RAE are things I know of from solving crossword puzzles. It‚Äôs nice to have a chance to use that kind of stuff. 

Nice to see LURID as an answer after the lucid/lurid issue I (and several others) had with Wednesday‚Äôs puzzle. 

I had a similar problem tonight, thanks to having SNObS at 51A. Luckily, MEbES is not a word, and I found my mistake relatively quickly. 

Thanks, Christina!",12,positive,0.9120297431945801
"I was tickled when a search on QUIET QUITTING led to a December 2022 New Yorker article in the topic, which leads off with an illustration of a woman in the PLOW pose.

Very well done puzzle, Ms. Iverson.",9,positive,0.8644376993179321
"Sigh. PiNAY crossing with LiNE did me in. I voluntarily give up my gold star when I need to look something up, as I had to do with PANAY. Unfortunately LANE and LiNE both fit the clue ""Track selection"" so I never would have figured it out without looking it up.",11,negative,0.8310442566871643
"I quiet-quit this pretty quickly, and was glad I did. This builder's mind works on a completely different frequency from mine.
I'll try for a do-over on Saturday.",7,positive,0.5621148347854614
"You mean the answer to ""like some teenagers and pasta"" wasn't ZITTI?

Quite the puzzle, a real test, and I'm tickled that Ms. Iverson, in charge of the Friday ez-clue version, is on double duty this week: it'll be interesting to compare the clues. By the time I was finished my yoga pose had changed from Plow to Downward Dog to Quiet-Quitting-Dog-Tired. 

Taft, a big man with big appetites, had a 1909 White Steam car that accommodated him. There's a sweet 7 minute video on him and his car:

"That yoga pose: the description in the clue wasn‚Äôt bringing it to mind, and even though this doesn‚Äôt fit, what my brain offered up was PLOTZ.

Any Yiddish speaking Yoga practitioners out there? 
Plotz pose: IS THAT A THING? 
I feel it might refer to any number of poses that are‚Ä¶unsuccessful.",21,negative,0.6635465025901794
Is TULSA generally considered a Southern city? I would definitely consider Oklahoma more the West than the South.,15,neutral,0.8817224502563477
There will no doubt be laughter in some solving quarters about the notion that the Acela Express is high speed.  Some great clues - like Deb I liked the FLUTE SOLO one; and 28D.  My in was TINY for the Lilliputians; some long forgotten and dusty neuron told me that TITO was one of the Jackson 5; I sussed the Hall mate in seconds; I guessed that TAFT was the car owning president; and the whole unpromising grid began to fall.  Fun and quickish for a Friday.,13,positive,0.8906177878379822
"OATES is not so much a mate of Hall anymore‚Äîprofessionally or as a friend.

Great puzzle, BTW.",10,neutral,0.5976512432098389
My first impulse for 25 across was NOPE.,17,negative,0.6447202563285828
"Christina is becoming a master.  Such an enjoyable puzzle with a lot of bite, which as the best puzzles do, made me feel denser than I felt before I started while I was solving, and made me feel smarter than I felt before I started once I was done.  If that makes sense.  

So much to savor that I won‚Äôt dwell on anything in particular, except to note the understated brilliance of ‚ÄúBreak into bits‚Äù for PARSE.  While BATARANGS and IS THAT A THING might be marquee entries (and what an apt pair!), Christina‚Äôs mastery extended throughout the puzzle and transformed a seemingly vanilla entry (PARSE) into a star.  

Marking this one down as a themeless POY contender.",36,positive,0.965206503868103
"The Friday puzzle is where, at least for me, the solving time goes up even when the puzzle doesn't throw anything at me that I can't figure out by the time I get to it a second or third time.

That's how this one went.  I can't usually solve a Friday by starting at 1A and moving sequentially.  My best strategy is to find a gimme, and work outwards from there. In this case, it was 33D (QUE).  I got the whole south before venturing northward, and finshed in the NE.  Nothing really held me up for long, but I still finished twice as slowly as on a good Wednesday.",15,neutral,0.6576343178749084
