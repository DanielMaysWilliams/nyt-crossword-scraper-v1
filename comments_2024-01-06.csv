The NE was the hardest area for me. BOKEH was the first word I put down so that was no problem. 14D, I immediately put sole instead of ONLY, which made me put ipo, not ACE, for 17A.  I felt pretty confident about those two and slightly less confidently put price at 12D, but I was confident enough overall that it led me to a major delay in detangling that section and bringing the ANTHEM part of Olympic bars home -- especially since I have no idea about drumming things.

I agree with all the commenters here, that it seems misplaced by the editors as a Saturday puzzle. 

But I'd also rather think that it was kind of them to throw us a bone, hence I'm not complaining.
 
Anything that gives me the momentary illusion of my IQ shooting up overnight is fine by me.

The puzzle was very well thought out and did offer just enough gentle resistance to make it a pleasure to solve.

I walk my friends' dog these days. She's quite fit-burly-but thankfully not agile enough to catch them.

Nicky(pictured) was agile enough though. A skilled hunter. I'll spare you the details of some of the treats he brought me on hikes.

Because I didn't want him to catch a squirrel, I'd stand behind my nearly motionless Nicky frantically waving my arms to frighten them, who just stared stupidly thinking I was throwing them peanuts.

So instead I resorted to shouting ""Let's get 'em!"" and charging loudly to frighten them.

"I was just thinking fondly of the '96 Clinton-Dole debate, because Clinton deployed the ""dog won't hunt line"" to such effect that it was possibly the moment he put away Dole for good. Even a transcript captures the smoothness Clinton oozed with: 

""When Senator Dole made that remark about all the elitists, young elitists in the administration, one of the young men who works for me who grew up in a house trailer looked at me and said, Mr. President, I know how you grew up. Who is he talking about? And you know this liberal charge, that's what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race. It's sort of their golden oldie, you know. It's a record they think they can play that everybody loves to hear. And I just don't think that dog will hunt this time.""

I misremembered it as the more succinct, flavorful ""That dog don't hunt,"" but I'm informed by very smart people it's actually ""That dog WON'T hunt."" It is the considered choice of the dog to hunt, not its pacifist nature or inability to hunt, that is the crux; there's a crucial difference between a dog that don't hunt and one that won't hunt. 

Fondly, because of the real engagement in that debate, in contrast to current political discourse. Plus, Dole kept it close enough to give us J. Farrell's 11-5-96 masterpiece puzzle (you could fill in either BOB DOLE or CLINTON - ELECTED correctly).

Joe Biden & Don Trump...8 letters each. Hmm.

"This Saturday puzzle definitely solved faster than yesterday's, although I'll say that what makes the spanners a bit more challenging to make out from a few crosses are the run of consonants. Here's what I mean:

HUMA (NPYR) AMID
PAGI (NGDRFR) EUD
THA (TD) O (GD) O (NTH) UNT
YEARE (NDB) ONUS

If you're trying to make out constituent words with a few crossings, the consonant runs can create a blurring effect. (I just learned it's called BOKEH (var. spelling BOKE).)

Not that I'm complaining. I'm just hypothesizing what may be going on here. For me, there's NO RUSH in trying to complete a puzzle. I'd rather make the fun last a little longer.
