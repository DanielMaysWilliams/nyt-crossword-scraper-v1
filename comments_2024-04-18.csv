The only *acre on an ocean floor that I know is ""nacre, so I was able to figure out that the star in a clue could be a ""b"" or an ""n.""

"A STAR IS B OR N.  Wow!!!

I've said it before and I'll say it again.  Every time you think no one can come up with a completely original puzzle idea, someone does.

Right away I saw all the missing ""B""s and ""N""s in the clues.  I parsed them all perfectly.  But why those missing letters?  Would the thrice-made movie have the word ""missing"" in it?  Or ""vanished""?  Or ""disappears""?  And what could possibly tie together an N and a B?

Had my life depended on it, I could not have come up with the answer.

So A STAR IS BORN comes in and I'm told to parse.  And I parse away.  Parse, parse, parse.  As tar is born?  What the--?  And that's not six words.

Aha!!!!  I see it!!!!  A big grin comes over my face.  This is so clever and so completely surprising.  It gives me a real kick on a rainy miserable morning.

"So, my head is around 5 to 6 feet off the ground. This theme was, conservatively, 200 feet over my head. I solved this thing well under average, but getting the theme? Haha, no. Then again, I'm constantly bewildered by magic, so this should be no surprise.",15,neutral,0.48053041100502014
"When I got 23A (the only thing that made sense once I had a bunch of crosses), the NACRE twist occurred to me, but then I couldn't make sense of things like NALLOT or NOVINE, so I just shrugged and charged ahead with guessing the rest of the theme entries. And I really didn't understand the theme for a while after finishing (which is the way I prefer these things to work out) because I couldn't reparse 63A (kept trying to make it start with AS). But then it clicked. Very nice.",3,neutral,0.6824519634246826
"I finished the puzzle, checked the missing letters, said ""a star is born... What? Six words? ... OH! A star is ""B"" OR ""N."" 

At that moment I felt as if the constructor elbowed my side and said, ""get it?? B OR N?? They replace the stars in the clues! Hahahaha!!!!"" 

And I have that half smile, half eye roll that's the reaction to all great dad jokes.",56,neutral,0.48775190114974976
"I see many folks got the theme, easily. 

Me? I guess I was left in the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-llow.

"Call me an idiot, but I hated this puzzle. Obtuse - and not in a fun way. Even after I figured out the 'theme,' it was a poor puzzle.
Not a fan.",72,negative,0.9468433856964111
"Fun puzzle. I got it but did so without understanding the ""trick"".  Also, I finished the puzzle and all of the squares are filled correctly, but it is still marked as not being correct. Any ideas? I checked it with the PDF several times. I'll give it another check, but if anyone else has had this problem let me know.",2,positive,0.651511013507843
Brilliant if one regards a B and an N as words. However it turns into a quick solve.,4,positive,0.7910307049751282
"What a fun theme! I did have to come to the column to figure out what it was, but after I saw how to parse the theme entry into six words, everything fell into place. 

My favorite entry though was 70A, as it brought me back to elementary school. I remember when pogs were briefly all the rage among my peers. I never got into them myself, but I still have the one I acquired in those days and it makes me smile when I see it.",7,positive,0.9620162844657898
"My hangup is that ""b"" and ""n"" are not really words. Bit I can't really think of a better way to clue it.",34,negative,0.7609102725982666
"Really really clever. I figured out the trick easily enough‚Äîa missing letter where the asterisk was‚Äîwhich made it pretty easy to guess the themes, but I love a theme where you can‚Äôt wait to see what the revealer would be and this one didn‚Äôt disappoint. A quick solve but extremely fun. LOL before I realized that the missing letters were always B or N I was looking for COVID of Ancient Greece and imagining some sort of mythological epidemic!",41,positive,0.9551361203193665
