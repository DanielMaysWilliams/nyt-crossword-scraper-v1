"So, I've only been solving since August 2023 so I'm not sure if I've encountered a Sam Ezersky crossword before. I've certainly seen his name though, so I can't compare it to any of his other puzzles but this was a real roller coaster ride for me! There were parts, including most of the theme, that I sailed through and felt on top of the world... Until I didn't! Some of those corners were killer for me with some difficult for me crosses that I just didn't know --  and left me feeling like a real dolt! But not in a bad way... Not like when I had to confess to my boss today that I had no idea how to use the printer for labels, after trying and failing, in an embarrassing fashion. 

Instead, some of the last ones I got on the puzzle today made me chuckle -- right after I kicked myself!

CURLING was awesome! After I accepted that it probably wasn't the sport, I kept thinking of curling hair and what might be a target of a curling iron, then I thought about targets that are physically curling, like the thing a person would shoot an arrow at... then I went back and revisited sports, then hair...

We have the definite ""Mercury is in this"" for GLASSTHERMOMETER---but plenty of glass thermometers contain ethanol rather than mercury. Clearly that clue should have been ""Mercury might be in this"" , but then it would duplicate the clue for RETROGRADE. ""The Mercury might be in this"" is fine for the interesting entry WNBAFINALS, but ""Mercury was in this"" seems odd for BOHEMIANRHAPSODY. Do we say that a singer is ""in"" a song?

"My heart did a happy little jump when I saw the name Sam Ezersky at the top of my puzzle this morning.  I figured I was in for a real workout.  It was a nice enough puzzle, but not what I expected in terms of difficulty.  Fun anyway, with novel clues for ENT and ARSON.  I wanted BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY as soon as I saw 17 A, but a few crosschecks made me realize that wasn't happening.  Glad to see it pop up (more appropriately with ""was"") at 58 A.",9,positive,0.9555479288101196
"Got the strong feeling Mr. Sam is a reader of the comments here, what with the inclusion of fill that sparked, ahem, spirited discussion.  Such as ATTA, ECHECK and BICEPS. 

Great fun swinging for the fences and filling in those spanners with a minimum of crosses.  Thought the Longshorepersons drank Rum but RYE fits - they're landlubbers after all.

"I was stuck at the very start looking for a three point letter other than the letters in the word ""scrabble"". Was it T, A, V? Seemed like a weak clue at the time but I wasn't getting it.
Also fixated on the sport of curling.

The mercury clues were quick for me but the clues that should have been simple did me in until I had them filled in with crosses. I didn't think I'd be able to finish the puzzle but finally straggled across the finish line.",6,negative,0.6081568002700806

I got hung up in a few sections (unknown sports or political clues) but the theme came to me quickly and the crosses helped the unknowns.

"I finished in a couple of minutes over my average time. It‚Äôs funny how carefully selected clues can mislead me into umpteen wrong answers. The theme part was the easy part. 

I came up with two or more possible answers to many clues, and somehow managed to pick the wrong answer to enter for each. The curling clue was one. It is curling season, after all, so I wrote STONES. Turns out the curling with a weight was the type of curling Sam had in mind, so BICEPS it was. 

Anyway, great work, Sam.",14,neutral,0.46357452869415283
"A Wednesday with a gimmick and a Thursday without one, what a strange week.

I had to look up some trivia, but otherwise I did not find the puzzle particularly hard. I understood the theme, with the exception of RETROGRADE - I only have a basic knowledge of astronomy, and it is mostly in Polish. I got the word from crosses and I googled it then, so now I understand the clue (and unwittingly I learned some things about the annoying idiocy of astrology, too... Apparently my wife can get angry at me because Mercury is in retrograde). WNBA FINALS I was able to fill in once I got a few crosses, even though I don't know a single name of a WNBA team (and very few NBA teams, too. Sadly you are right if you see a hint of sexism here. Basketball is not popular here these days, and all I know about it I learned from friends who were fascinated by it in the quite mysoginistic early 1990s, when after the fall of ""communism"" we were in inundated with Western culture, inaccessible before, and an interest in NBA was one of the fads, but nobody cared about women's sports üòê).

I was glad to remember IMARET from a puzzle a few weeks or months back.

I was about to ask here for an explanation of ENT and their stuffy clients, but then it dawned on me - that's what you call a laryngologist, for short. In Polish it's... Laryngolog. In fact, we call most doctors by their Greek or Latin names. It took me years to learn what it is they do, since the names are so strange.",16,neutral,0.5626329779624939

"On the first mercury clue, I immediately thought RETROGRADE but of course that was too short. But it meant that I had the fill right away for the second one and caught on to the theme quickly. Only got stuck on the WNBA team because I hadn‚Äôt heard of them- I was convinced that one had to do with the car and kept trying things like PARKINGLOT and CARGARAGE.

"Good golly that was hard. So a Thursday with no tricks is harder than a ‚Äòtricky‚Äô Thursday. 

Going to the column, I see that it was Sam E who made this puzzle. So now, I‚Äôm pleased with myself for getting the gold. The themers were clever enough.  But all those two word phrases were awkward fill. 

I definitely feel like this puzzle required a bunch of knowledge to get through. Maybe I‚Äôm just trying to pat myself on the back.

"Stately, plump, the used '83 Mercury Lynx, responsive & flesh colored, was my first car; I feel a twinge that such a loyal car met her end from an unfilled radiator.  Some cars later I found myself driving a Mercury Sable, sleek and fast and prone to a terminal illness that left the mechanics at a loss. The oldest and wisest of them came forward and pronounced, almost rabbinically, ""That which we cannot see we cannot fix."" So I was hoping against hope that there would be a shout-out to my cars, like, the answer to ""The Mercury might be in this"" could've been REPAIR SHOP, since that's where the Sable spent a lot of her time. On the other hand, I don't like to eulogize cars or see them in a puzzle. And I like The WNBA Mercury. I'll like 'em even better if they get Elena Delle Donne, though the Mystics would fain give her up.

I don't believe in these things, but when there's a lot of negativity in the air and things just aren't going my way, there's an uncanny correlation to those times and Mercury being in retrograde, which could last for some time. Weeks! And I bet astrologers can deduce personality types from natal charts: the mercurial sort, the saturnine, the martial kind, the venusians, the earthy. Poor Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune, they got nothing! And Pluto's been bumped!

"I need to explain my aversion to the (now quite dated in academic circles) term HERSTORY.

Women - like men - are part of *history*. If we segregate women to their own ""story"" (or special offset box on the textbook page), we end up making them peripheral to the dominant tales we tell about the past. The story of the Nineteenth Amendment is not exclusively a story about women gaining the franchise; after all, at a basic level, it relied on the votes of male legislators to make it happen. It changed the makeup of the electorate as a whole. It reflected an evolution in ideas about citizenship. (It also enfranchised white women *far* more successfully than women of color.)

(It's also true that the wordplay doesn't work grammatically, but that isn't my main concern. Additionally, the amendment as written didn't actually grant the vote to ""women."" Rather, it excluded ""sex"" as a criterion for limiting the franchise. Though given the historical moment, the effect was to grant the vote to [some] women, it was worded to apply broadly to everyone.)

Paying attention to groups who have been traditionally overlooked in mainstream accounts of the past shouldn't just add other stories we can pay attention to or ignore as we choose; it should transform the stories we already have to make them more accurate because they have become more inclusive and therefore better reflective of their subjects.
