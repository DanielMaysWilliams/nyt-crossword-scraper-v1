"I love a Saturday puzzle that makes me feel smart. 

Unrelated to today, but what is the general feeling about using the help functions among solvers?  I think using the ‚Äúreveal‚Äù function is a definite no-no if you want to consider having solved the puzzle (as is looking up a clue online, or googling something within the clue), but I think using the ‚Äúcheck‚Äù function occasionally is..sort of okay?  It doesn‚Äôt give answers but it helps move things along and avoids getting stuck forever because of a wrong square. I‚Äôm at a point in my solving where I generally solve through weds (sometimes Thurs) with no help. But Thurs on I tend to use the ‚Äúcheck‚Äù assist as needed.

I was frozen, staring blankly. Like I had fainted standing up.(Hopefully not emitting an odor of decay like one commenter here mentioned.)

A server there asked if he could help me to a chair and I nodded weakly. I feel bad for the employees as I must have been a frightful sight, and not something they should have to deal with. They were wonderful though.

So I'm sitting at a table with a glass of ice water they brought me, trying to collect myself. Then-kapow-I spent a minute or three on fire, sweating profusely. Huh. So my fever broke and I hadn't even realized I was sick.

I felt a bit better after that and walked home. I don't know if it was the flu or something else, but the symptoms weren't too bad so don't cry for me Argentina or any other country.

My nose wasn't stuffy or runny. Minor sore throat. Slight headache. I almost feel guilty because the worst symptom was also a saving grace: I was utterly exhausted. So rather than lying in bed suffering, I slept. The whole day. Woke up a few times feeling too hot or too cold, but quickly fell back asleep.

ONCE MORE you show us that you've got the chops, giving us a PLETHORA (gosh I love that word!) of interesting fill, less passing the muster and more flying high. Kudos!

Speaking of flying...

I misread the clue ""Coming out phrase"" as ""Coming out *phase*"" and filled in IMago, convinced that gay people had an insider lingo for different phases of coming out. 

I stopped for a moment to take in the magnificence of IMago as the last step, past any guilt or fear they might be made to feel, when they can be liberated to fly free.
 
Perhaps they should adopt the word, evoking the beauty of the butterfly, finally taking wings and at last being able to be who they are. 

Lou Rawls  said it best when he said
 ""You've got one life to live 
   So live it in peace
   Live it in truth 
   Live it in love.""

May all those who are gay be able to do just that -- imago! -- encountering respect from all others and equality of rights with all others, being able to  live their life in peace, in truth, in love.

It was a great day for CLEveland when they sent Chief Wahoo back down to the minors, and changed the name of the MLB team to the Guardians. The name was chosen to honor, and logos designed to reflect, the Guardians of Traffic, eight monumental Art Deco sculptures which decorate the pylons at either end of the Hope Memorial Bridge in Cleveland. Each Guardian protectively cradles a different mode of transportation againt his bared bosom: hay wagon, stagecoach, automobile, truck.

Desgned by architect Frank Walker and sculptor Henry Hering, and built in 1932, the Hope Memorial Bridge spans the Cuyahoga River and has its eastern terminus near the (MLB) Guardians' home Progressive Field. Formerly, and more functionally, named the Lorain-Carnegie Bridge, in 1983 the bridge was renamed to honor Harry Hope--father of Comedian Bob--a local stone-mason who worked on the bridge, and, presumably, all the other construction workers as well. But they didn't have famous sons.

"Very quick for a Saturday.  If I hadn't written IGUANA in the boxes where SENTRA belonged and failed to notice for a bit, it probably would have been my fastest ever.  

TORERO brings to mind a quote I copied from a letter to the editor in a local paper over 40 years ago, and still have posted at my desk.  I think it was written in regards to a circus, but it fits so many other situations.

""another example of mans selfish insistence upon exploiting modified animal behavior to suit his entertainment needs""

"Hello, I‚Äôve been doing crosswords for 15 years and it is obvious that they are being dumbed down. I completed today‚Äôs Saturday puzzle in 20 minutes with no lookups. In the past I needed at least 40 minutes to an hour. This is very disappointing. I am considering cancelling my subscription as I can get second rate crosswords anywhere. You once were the gold standard. Now you‚Äôre like the rest.",7,negative,0.8726980090141296
"I loved this puzzle - mostly because it‚Äôs the first Saturday puzzle I have completed without help - no lookups or auto-complete. Whoo-hoo! I loved all the long spanners.

"Great puzzle! I wonder at the difference between smooth and easy. 

I had to look up the source of Brahmaputra, I simply didn‚Äôt know IMPUTE or JIA, so I looked up the latter and got the former from crosses. Wordplay gave me PLETHORA, and then I was home free.

Just a minor nit - that the Brahmaputra is indeed what the river is called in India - in Tibet it is the Tsangpo.   Perhaps that‚Äôs okay as a Saturday level misdirection.",5,positive,0.5309879183769226
"I didn‚Äôt think I would ever solve a Saturday puzzle in less than 10 minutes, but this grid came along to prove me wrong. Nevertheless, I found it quite charming and very fun to solve.

"Very clean. Very thoughtful puzzle. 
I liked the three down spanners. 

It was so smooth, that is maybe why so many people got through this so quickly. 

This is what I aspire my regular Saturday solve to be like. 

Hoang-Kim Vu clearly got good constricting skills. 

Yesterday was all about‚Äùhooking up‚Äù.SHAG, BOOTYCALL.  Today was all about what happens if it aren‚Äôt careful. ONESIE, BABYMOON,

"Sounds like there were a few personal bests on this one. Just a weird tidbit, but in New Zealand, the ‚Äúo‚Äù is dropped and the possum is a pest. Beautiful, warm fur, but decimates the landscape. In Oz, the possum is a protected species, go figure? So if you see a possum in Hyde Park (Au) and it gets a bit vicious (which they can), lay on your back with your feet in the air - they will always go to the highest point.

"Easy for a Saturday, but *so* well constructed. Beautiful long fills, clues that perfectly mixed trivia, wordplay, and some solid crossword puzzling. On top of that, there was nothing overly obtuse or dubious. Everything felt like it flowed so well up and down the puzzle and all the crosses were well placed. 

Anyway, I really enjoyed it‚Äîa good puzzle from a talented constructor.",24,positive,0.9426332116127014

"I found this the easiest puzzle this week since Monday. Granted, I had to turn on Autocheck to complete it in reasonable time, mostly for alphabet runs in unknown trivia, but Tuesday thru Friday I resorted to revealing answers on top of autochecking.

TOR, BABYMOON and SIT SHIVA were completely new to me. Yet again I was amazed by the American tendency to abbreviate everything. Do you really use ATTN to call attention to something? Would the full word not do the trick better? I mean, it is much more poignant than some abbreviation. Such shorthand is very rarely used in Polish, and after over 6 months of doing these puzzles I am still surprised by how often things get abbreviated in the US.

I do not understand why Caped crusader? works as a clue for TORERO. Could somebody please explain?",10,positive,0.7259621024131775

"LOL!  I started to writing something using the E word even though I hate when people say that when the comment section started closing on its own every time I tried to continue.  I'll take that as a sign and move on to this was indeed a super smooth solve. I did have to do a little fixing on AMARETTO because I had __A__T__ and I decided to try blAckTea.

BENTS
EWER
IMPUTE

"Also. There's only one thing I think of when I come across the word PLETHORA: 

El Guapo : Jefe, what is a plethora?

Jefe : Why, El Guapo?

El Guapo : Well, you told me I have a plethora. And I just would like to know if you know what a plethora is. I would not like to think that a person would tell someone he has a plethora, and then find out that that person has *no idea* what it means to have a plethora.

Jefe : Forgive me, El Guapo. I know that I, Jefe, do not have your superior intellect and education. But could it be that once again, you are angry at something else, and are looking to take it out on me?",9,negative,0.49208590388298035
"A few things I wasn't familiar with, but the crosses helped out a lot. Solve was very much random at first, with words going in all over the grid. But that got me started, and things filled in nicely after that. Liked the phrase answers and a few of the others as well.

Hoang-Kim's grid has lots to love. In addition to the wonderful down spanners and the temporal pairs at 28A and 45A, I see:

(1) The rotationally symmetric pairing of SOIREE with NO SHOW (so disappointing!)

(2) The rotationally symmetric pairing of LISTENED with BABY MOON (ultrasound, anyone?)

(3) In the North, we spot two sets of swamp creatures -- OPOSSUMS and MANATEES
