"I seem at a point in life where I have no sense of time. I faithfully worked out to Billy Blanks' Tae Bo videos back in the day, but confidently plopped Zumba down, which I've never done, instead. That held me back but made me smile when I eventually had to switch it and remembered my much younger, eager(er) days as a Tae Bo enthusiast. 

Everything else that held me back was less smiley. There were so many names I just didn't know, sometimes close together. I did well on the bottom and got the double theme early on. But the upper west side, especially 29A through 63A were so hard for me. I guessed at KRYSTal and had no idea about the country singer. I had DATAS and tried so many reasonable sounding things that didn't work. 

Had THE ghost instead of THE CURSE for a long time! I knew there was a haunted deal out there but thought it had something to do with Babe Ruth's ghost! Ha! 

Many have mentioned the SNOOZE ALARM. Agreed! I thought SNOOZE button immediately, being rather well-versed in them, but no alarms went off for alarm until it was obvious! I'm sure some people call it that, though. 

Many mentioned UPPISH instead of UPPIty. I'm glad to know UPPISH now because of what UPPIty came to mean, already explained in comments. 

I loved the theme and revealer! I thought that was a lot of fun! I loved DEAR ANN, though it took me a wee bit to remember ANN instead of Abby.

ANORAK - in the UK this is a lightweight waterproof. Not particularly ""warm"".

"Very clever and enjoyable idea for a puzzle.  I was hooked on the quite interesting double clues.  But to finish, I had to cheat on STP; had to ""check"" the A of ARIKARA, a tribe I never heard of; and I still ended up with a 1-letter DNF:  MIDSEASON/ABI instead of MUDSEASON/ABU.  I don't know from ""Aladdin"" and in New York, we don't have a MUD SEASON.  Not even those of us, like me, who spend a lot of time in Central Park have a MUD SEASON.  It's a term that's never used because we're a city of sidewalks.

Yes, ABU sounds more Aladdin-y than ABI, but I still never thought of MUD.

I expect that, when I go back to read the blog, lots of other solvers will have mud all over their faces too.

So what's an UPPISH person?  Someone who's a little bit UPPIty?  (Which is what I had for, like, forever.)

I also give the side eye to SWIM SHIRT.  Some people do swim in a shirt to avoid sunburn, but there's no such thing as a designated SWIM SHIRT.  One person may wear a Polo, one person may wear an Aloha and the rich guy paddling next to you may be wearing Armani.

A couple of lovely serendipities: SNOOZE ALARM abutting HEAR ME, and four A-bookends (AROMA, ACELA, ALBERTA, AGRA) in the space of five columns (I felt for poor ARIKARA on the other side of the grid).

Thank you, Michael, for a splendid solve.  You‚Äôve got the chops, and I eagerly await your next!",23,positive,0.9656873345375061

"This was a fun puzzle.  I found it a little more difficult than usual for a Sunday, but I really enjoyed it.

"Well... after reading the comments, it turns out that my first search for 15 letter answers today was probably quite appropriate. Two results:

LETSDOTHATAGAIN
DONTDOTHATAGAIN

Each of those only ever appeared in one puzzle. 

Where was I. Oh yeah - tough one for me, of course, with quite a few answers that were complete unknowns as clued,  and... with my overly focused brain I have to admit that I never entirely caught on to what was going on with the paired across clues until I came here. Head desk. That was really, really clever. 

And... twelve answers appearing for the first time in any puzzle and eleven more that had only appeared once or twice before. That's... unusual. 

Oh... and must admit that I was a bit surprised to see that several commenters were, uhhh... FLUSTRATED with one of the answers. I though that was fairly familiar.

I'm done.

"When I saw Michael Schlossberg's name this morning, it made me happy.  I like his style.  Double clues are fun, and I don't remember seeing them with such long answers before. Getting those FEELINGs in there was a bonus. BRAVO Michael, and thanks for another great puzzle.

I recently learned UPful from another vendors puzzle (where it gave me great agita), so UPPISH went in without a qualm.

I was certain I would be spending as much time tracking down errors as I did filling the puzzle in, but I didn‚Äôt have to correct a thing. The crosses provided enough words that I was certain were correct that the theme answers worked despite my not parsing some of them until later. 

PR AGENCIES and FLU STRAIN, I‚Äôm looking at you. Even knowing what they are doesn‚Äôt keep from thinking, ‚ÄúThat looks wrong,‚Äù for a second when I go back to the puzzle.

"Very odd experience for me.  I‚Äôm in Atlantic City for poker tournament tomorrow.  Not my usual milieu.  Played some tonight to warm up.  Did first half of puzzle on phone while waiting to be called to a table and second half on phone after playing (a modest win which would have been better if my pocket aces were not rudely cracked).  Well, this story is frankly going nowhere.  I‚Äôve lost my train of thought and should be asleep by now.  Casinos are weird places. Like visiting an alien planet.  But I really enjoyed this puzzle.  I did not struggle as much as some others.  I thought the prevailing sentiment might be ‚Äútoo easy‚Äù and ‚Äúnot tricksy‚Äù enough.

"Got through most of the puzzle okay, but had to turn on autocheck for the Dakota tribe and SE corner. I started iterating though all the letters because nothing was making sense. 

You can imagine the curse-laden question that came out of my mouth when I saw 119-A was a FLUS TRAIN. I figured it was some BS kiddie crap from Fortnite or YouTube or something. Imagine how silly I felt when I came here to dread the comments and finally realized I was reading it wrong, but using a Chinese name as the crosser always throws me because almost any combination of letters can work, so it doesn‚Äôt help one bit if you don‚Äôt know the person in question.",5,negative,0.6541634202003479

But a harder Sunday. I am sure many appreciate, but not me. 

That said.  A solid puzzle. Appreciated the double clues. More than the shaded trick.  Made me work. Thank you. 

Maybe create something like this for a 15x15?

"Completely irrelevant to solving this puzzle, but ""Once More with Feeling"" was a musical episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer that is generally considered one of the best in that series and simply a great use of musical influences in an otherwise non-musical show.

"My brain was definitely not in the GODDESS mode for this puzzle.  Many struggles, despite nearly wrecking my arm from patting myself on the back when I wasn't fooled by some tricky clues, but I know GEN-Z, so why was I sliding over GENERATIONs while I was doing all that flyspecking?  

I've heard uppity, as in ""Don't get uppity,"" for as long as I can remember.  So what is UPPISH?  Does it mean you're kind of uppity?  

For a minute FLUSTRAIN seemed like it might be a bit off-color because I don't think of flu as the target of an ad campaign. It's the vaccine they're selling, not the flu.

Grousing aside, I loved this puzzle.  A challenge on a Sunday is good, and if others found it too hard or too easy, I thought it was just right.  Michael Schlossberg does not disappoint. Thank you, Mr. S.  I had a really good time with this one.",41,negative,0.7543707489967346
"Quite a bit slower than average for me! Wasn't really able to get into a flow on this one. The whole area around PRAGENCIES especially ground my solve to a halt. 

Also, seemed like a high density of niche/unfamiliar author names in the grid. One or two can be fun, because I solve the crosses and then learn about someone new. But these just felt like friction/grid-glue to me.

Still, the repeated cluing was very enjoyable wordplay. Hope to see more puzzles from this constructor, just with slightly crunchier fill!",16,negative,0.535072922706604

"I solved this puzzle without the help of the revealer or the title. For some reason, the hints didn't click with me.

(1) I'm used to seeing clues repeated in puzzles for different entries. So my reaction here to the identically clued pairs was ""ha, pretty cool,"" never once connecting them with ""Gimme a Second!""

(2) Yeah, I saw the shaded letters spell words like ZEAL and RAGE (""ok, that's nice""), never once connecting them with 68A. Maybe because I didn't understand the title to begin with, I didn't understand what could be an alternative title either.

The one themer that gave me a little trouble was PR AGENCIES. Like DR FREUD yesterday, I wasn't seeing the PR and instead was trying to make out a word that began with PRA_. Also, I wanted Idling rather than IN IDLE.

Anyway, this was wonderfully executed, Michael. And I love the explanation (""100 theme letters, give or take"").",18,negative,0.49605539441108704

"About five minutes faster than my average, even though I dozed off for some unknown amount of time with the puzzle about 20% complete (maybe just seconds, who knows?). I got PRAGENCIES and FLUSTRAIN on the crosses, and after the music played I stared nonplussed at the two of them for quite a while before I managed to parse them. (FLUST RAIN? FLUS TRAIN? What the...?) I almost googled them, which probably wouldn't have helped.

Let me express my admiration to the constructor for not just coming up with four pairs of entries that could share clues, and not just pairs where one of them contains an emotion, but in all four cases pairs that have a total of 20 letters. Well done!",12,neutral,0.5414509773254395

"This one was an average-buster for me, and all the trouble was in the SE corner, where I initially had BCC for FWD and ATM for URN, and then took out ATM to put in COST instead of DENT.  I had no idea what was for me ""random East Asian surname"" and could neither see what kind of STRAIN nor what emotion --ST could be, even though both should have come easily (especially the STRAIN, because I did notice ""viral"" in the clue, but I kept thinking of Covid).

I didn't know what went before SAVED either, and tried some weird stuff--CITY while BCC was still in there, LIFE once I was sure of SET, etc.  

The bottom line is that when you get into an area like this, you have to realize that the instincts that got you through 95% of the puzzle have failed you here, and you have to rip it all out.

Luckily, FLU finally came to me.  (Who thought I'd ever write that sentence.)  I realized that BCC had to be FWD, and COST was actually DENT.  With those in place, WE'RE became clear, and at that point, Bob was my uncle.  (Actually, he's my brother-in-law.)

I assume Min Jin LEE is more famous than I realize. (Why not Ang, Spike or Robert E.?)

In retrospect, none of it was that hard to come up with, and I should have gotten all of it much faster.  The worst part was it came at the end, so I had nothing to move to and come back later.
