"Traveling and late to the party, but for the record:

This was a GREAT themeless. 

Hard for a Friday. Yes, that NW corner was a bear. I had to put the puzzle down and come back to it which I rarely do. 

But when I did come back to it I finished it, without any lookups, even with PHYLLIS WHEATLEY crossing SHILOH and LIV TYLER and OPIE.

As to the complaints about vague clues: As @Steve L and others have said: The vagueness of the clues is THE WHOLE POINT. That is literally one of the features of a NYT Friday or Saturday crossword, and what makes it a ‚Äúpuzzle‚Äù for many of us. 

You don‚Äôt have to enjoy vague clues. But you also don‚Äôt have to do crosswords on Friday. The one think you shouldn‚Äôt do is to try a Friday puzzle and then complain that the clues are too vague!

At first, I worried it was unsolvABLE for me. There was tumblin' tumbleweed blowing across my screen. But one by one, I filled them in, while sipping a MARTINI (though I'm a purist with martinis and hate coffee). I finished it this late morning with my caffeine of choice, a nice crisp Diet Coke. 

REWRITES HISTORY came to me fairly quickly once I got going‚Äîmostly for a negative reason. I've recently said to a few people that a certain close person in my life got her PhD in Revisionist History. Just a little truthy joke that helps me cope with this person.

The NW corner was killer and the last to fall, like many of you. I mistook the slangy catchy tunes I've found in past puzzles to be pOPS, so that didn't help. It made me think put on blast would be to poSt, like on social media. 

Lots of fun and proud moments. My time in the archives may be paying off. Also, glad to learn about PHILLIS WHEATLEY!

This was in my opinion a very solid Friday puzzle.  It actually played more like a Saturday for me, as I had very little the first time through, and I figured I was in for a serious battle.

Having found a few things near the bottom to get a foothold, I was able to make headway, and eventually completed the puzzle at the top, which was quite sparse halfway through my solve.

Experienced solvers look forward to puzzles like this one because we can breeze through a lot of supposedly challenging late-week puzzles, even though these puzzles give trouble to less experienced solvers.

I can appreciate that this one might have been a backbreaker for newer or less proficient solvers, but that doesn't make it a bad puzzle.  Vague cluing?  A feature, not a flaw.  Obscure trivia?  Ditto.
