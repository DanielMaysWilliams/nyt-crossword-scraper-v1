"I much enjoyed today's puzzle! Very fun! I finished it a little above my average for a Monday, I think more because I'm starting to get used to some of the crosswordese more and more. I enjoyed it thoroughly! 

Because I had a little extra time I decided to do a Monday from the year 2000, somewhat randomly. There was a question about where you place the needle on a phonograph, and I liked that connection to today's puzzle! Some of the other clues surprised me though because I don't think they would be clued that way these days. I only started doing the crossword in early August of this year so I'll have to do more from back in the day.",0,positive,0.9748695492744446

"Gee, and I thought gadgets were getting exponentially better by the day.

Let me tell you about the compact Harman Kardon STEREO that I bought 2nd-hand from a neighbor in my building back in the early 1970s.  (He was upgrading to a major apartment-wide system.)  Since it bought 2nd-hand, I figure it was vintage 1960s.  Maybe even 1950s.  It lasted me about 30 years, and here are all the things it could do completely by its lonesome -- without the help of a DJ.

It could SET A NEW RECORD.  You stacked them in maybe 5 at a time).

It could MOVE THE NEEDLE.  You wouldn't want ME moving the needle, now, would you?  I'd scratch the record.

It had its own TURNTABLE.  I mean you wouldn't expect ME to run around the table that was holding the gadget myself -- at a quick pace of 78 RPMs a minute?  Even 33 RPMs a minute would be taxing.  Although one could save a bundle on a gym membership.

"More radio nerd info related to 4D:

AM is short for Amplitude Modulation. It does not specify any radio frequency band. A better term for this band is MW for medium wave,  530-1700 kiloHertz here in the US. 
AM broadcasting is found on LW (longwave), MW, and SW (shortwave) frequencies.

AM suffers from electrical noise created by nature (lightning) and manmade (modern day switching power supplies)

"Oh, good eyes, Sean Ziebarth, to find these four phrases that normally are used outside of a DJ context, yet describe what DJs do.  Very clever theme.  Bravo on that!

There were some lovely serendipities today:  
• A final-letter schwa-de-vivre parade of KARMA, NANA, ERA, SEGA, STAMINA, and LASAGNA.  
• The abutting neighbors TOTEM POL.  
•  It was hard to add to the Ezrameister’s excellent PuzzPair© list, but I did find BOLT and FLEA.  
• And how nerdy is my brain?  It tapped me on the shoulder to point out the anagrammed AGED (from EGAD) crossing a backward AGES.  I believe I need to get out more.

To those following my feeble attempts to guess the revealer – after leaving it blank and not reading its clue, a skill I’m so weak at – I actually did it today! I did it! Dear reader, don’t tell me it was obvious.  Don’t tell me it was easy.  Please just let me float on my cloud.

So, Sean, you got me spinning in many directions, all of them good, in your spinning-themed puzzle.  Thank, you sir!",25,positive,0.9251143932342529
"On the slow side (flip side?) for a Monday for me - but a cute puzzle and enjoyable workout. Side note: 

While still in high school back in the 60's I was an evening AMDJ occasionally on the local radio station (WMIQ) managed by my father. Interesting to see that WLS and WCFL were already mentioned in earlier comments, since those were the go-to stations for the teenagers in my home town, so I typically didn't have all that much of an audience. But...

...one evening in 1968, I got to the station and found that we'd just received the Beatles' White Album and announced that I was going to play the whole thing that evening. Found out the next day that word got around quickly and I might well have had the largest evening audience ever for that station.

Sorry for the drift. Enjoyed the puzzle. Rock on.

"A fine puzzle with its PuzzPairs* creating a nice stereo effect: DUOS such as psst & nodded at; stamina & stoics; sega & gamer; since & olde; vented & ash, and the echo of AMISS and DON'T MISS A BEAT. Curious about AM Stereo, I read a few paragraphs on it and while that doesn't make me an expert, I am now confident that it is NOT the radio band for news & talk, typically not currently anyway, but was a technique meant to emulate the stereo qualities of FM radio on an AM band: it was first adopted in the late 80s but quickly grew unpopular and was largely not in use until a resurgence of interest in the mid-2000s thanks to the advances of C-QUAM decoding in HD radio receivers but are still a tiny fraction of the market. I rest my case and am eager for a rebuttal from either Steve L. or Senor Ancona, or any other radiohead. I wanna be sedated!

Sam Corbin, I have no idea what bubblegrunge would sound like, but would certain enter it in a crossword if the clue was ""Ring around a bathtub."" 

Sean Ziebarth: I like how you deal: no one will ever have to tell you to be cool 'cause you ARE cool, and while I am no fan of Visage I can tell you're a musical omnivore and will look you up to dj the next bar mitzvah in our family (it's going to be a fair few years, don't worry).
