"""Bird with a lot of stuffing?""  It was joke.  A play on words.  You know, like you put stuffing in a turkey, or as some people like to do, call the turkey a bird.  When you are making a joke or using humorous wordplay you are allowed some leeway.  Larry Bird did some stuffing.  Do we need to argue whether or not he did a *lot* of stuffing?  Why do people go out of their way to nitpick the puzzle?  Stop being so negative and just enjoy a humorous clue.",10,neutral,0.658519983291626

Apologies, but the comments were closed by the time I finished the Sunday puzzle, partly due to the super bowl, but also to the difficulty.

Sports knowledge really wasn’t necessary, so I was a happy solver. I do at least know who Larry Bird is, and I thought that was a terrific clue. (In spite of a couple of grumpy complaints.)

"I am glad that the constructor bided his time all these years until he could come up with an appropriate theme fill, owing to the team name change.

The puzzle was somewhat harder than the usual Tuesday for me.  I do take somewhat of an exception to a previously discussed clue/fill.  Larry Bird in his heyday was much more apt to take the outside shot rather than “stuff”  or dunk the ball.  I feel , therefore, that the clue is somewhat of a stretch to use the Bird surname with the masked capital letter and the play on words with the basketball term “stuff”, as in dunk.

All in all, however, it was an enjoyable puzzle with a well executed theme.",9,positive,0.6817164421081543

"Sports.  Oy.

To say that I am unsportsed may be something of an understatement.  So this was a slog, and ended with a complete misunderstanding, which I learned from the column.  I got real proud of myself when I figured out the whole gimmick, which turned out to be wrong.  I thought the first word of each theme entry would be the name of a player on the team in the second part.  I figured there was someone named BROWN who played for a team called the  BEARs.  I thought there was someone named BLUE, who played for a team called the FLAMEs.  Is there really a sports team called the FLAMEs?  A sports player named GUARDIAN?  So today I learned the names of some sports teams and thought I had learned the names of some players.  Well, win some, lose some.

"The two entries that some people had problems with are related.  They are absolutely correct but the confusion arises from new usages and language evolving.

Long before a basketball dunk was possible, let alone common, it would be entirely accurate to describe a a high scoring shooter as stuffing the basket with lots of balls going through the net.  It was only later that the term started being used to describe a dunk and took over that term.

As for the supercharger thing, as others have noted the original means of charging the cylinders with more air than the ambient atmosphere allowed was a mechanical item that was powered by the crankshaft.  Later, turbochargers were developed and used the engine exhaust to do exactly the same thing without putting a load on the engine.  The old standard of the mechanical became the norm for supercharger though the turbo is also one, simply powered in a different way.",6,neutral,0.7495058178901672

"I was completely unaware that there was a theme while I was solving, didn't look for one, didn't miss one.  Then I hit the revealer, saw TEAM PLAYER, saw that there were asterisks I hadn't noticed, and thought: ""Better go back and see what this was all about.""

Who on earth are the MLB ""Guardians""?  Never heard of them. Must Google.

Cleveland Guardians???!!!  Really?  Never heard of them.  Who's the Cleveland team that I actually know?  Think, Nancy, think hard.  Oh, yes, the Cleveland Indians.  Aha, now I see!  One of those names that was culturally insensitive and had to be changed like ""Braves"" and ""Redskins"".  When did that happen?  Beats me.

That may be because my last year of watching MLB was 1969, the year of the ""Miracle Mets"".  After my beloved NY Giants were unceremoniously whisked off to SF in 1957 by the evil and greedy Horace Stoneham, I had tried to switch my allegiance to the Mets, but failed abysmally.  Gave up watching baseball entirely.  There's no disillusionment to compare with the disillusionment of a young child.

Anyway, while today's theme was a clever bit of construction, it was also completely miss-able while solving.  Which means that it didn't do much for me.",7,neutral,0.5819478631019592

"As a former Cleveland, I wholly approve of the MLB team's name change. It was a great day for the city when they sent Chief Wahoo back down to the minors, and changed the name of the MLB team to the Guardians. The name was chosen to honor, and logos designed to reflect, the Guardians of Traffic, eight monumental Art Deco sculptures that decorate the pylons at either end of the Hope Memorial Bridge in Cleveland. Each Guardian protectively cradles a different mode of transportation against his bared bosom: hay wagon, stagecoach, automobile, truck, etc.

Designed by architect Frank Walker and sculptor Henry Hering, and built in 1932, the Hope Memorial Bridge spans the Cuyahoga River and has its eastern terminus near the (MLB) Guardians' home Progressive Field. Formerly, and more functionally, named the Lorain-Carnegie Bridge, in 1983 the bridge was renamed to honor Harry Hope, father of Comedian Bob a local stone-mason who worked on the bridge; and, presumably, the tribute was meant to extend to all the other construction workers as well. But they didn't have famous sons.

For those with an eye for bizarre detail, the areolas on the sculptures' chests are designed to resemble little wheels.

"This is Peter’s 127th Times puzzle, and we see several reasons why today.

He is persistent, yes, hanging on to this theme idea for a quarter century.  More evidence? Peter once told me that in his experience, nine out of ten theme ideas don’t work out, that constructors get an idea, spend 20 minutes on it, get nowhere, then toss it. (I agree.) And yet – he persists!  Amazingly, he continues his output of sparkling themes.

He is skilled at grid-making.  Where is the junk in this puzzle? (Crickets.)  Then look at that double-stack of theme answers TEAM PLAYERS and GUARDIAN ANGEL, and look at the answers crossing it – smooth as can be, not a hint of desperation.

Other factors contributing to his constructing excellence – he has an amazing memory, and his brain is lightning quick and clever.  This became obvious to me after he edited one of my puzzles, which involved real-time online back-and-forth.   

Crosslandia is extremely lucky to have Peter.
