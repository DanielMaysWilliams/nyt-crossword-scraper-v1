"Quite an odd menu of DRINKS, is it not?  

My first take on looking at the puzzle as I printed it out (one for me, one for PhysicsDaughter) was to think, ""Jon Marquez!  Oh, joy!  Is it the actor who portrayed the feckless Constable Penhale on ""Doc Martin""?  Then I saw this is, at best, JOE, his younger brother.... and likely not even a relation at all.

But I digress.  Like all Monday puzzles, this was over too soon, so I used the extra time to check the Constructor's Note....  interesting to read this was accepted before he ""could legally drink,""  which doesn't exactly mean he wasn't getting up to something despite his age....   

We are expecting a Blessed Event:  a pair of House Sparrows are nesting in the bluebird box.  It took me a week to get a good enough look through my binoculars to identify the male.  He is so 'sturdy' that he has to struggle and wriggle a bit to get out of the opening, while the sylphlike female slips in and out easily.  These 'imports' are larger than native sparrows...  The bluebirds and the chickadees that were investigating the box are out of luck for this round.  You snooze, you lose.",8,neutral,0.6416390538215637
"Perfectly reasonable for a Monday puzzle, but the theme seemed a bit weak to me. RIVERMOUTH sounds odd, unlike, say, riverbank. Yes, it contains VERMOUTH, but feels a bit forced to me. Really wanted another themer in there somewhere. The GIN in TWINENGINE missed by one letter, and even a drink above the ME in the revealer would have worked.

VERMOUTH, WINE and SAKE seem a bit underwhelming as drinks go.

"What an adorable theme.

But I made it harder for myself when trying to guess the revealer because I considered the rather obvious DRINKS [ARE] ON ME to be a no-no.  You can't use ME twice, once in the grid and once in the revealer, can you? I thought.

So I eliminated ME in my mind and substituted ""I"".  I'M UNDER the what???? 

Nope, can't be UNDER; we've got an UNDER in UNDERGO at 10D. Moving right along.  I'M BENEATH the what???  I'M BELOW the what???  The booze?  The liquor?  The alcohol. Meanwhile I'm slowing my solve down to a crawl so I'll figure it before I get to the revealer.  

Too fast.  There's the revealer, obvious as all get-out, hiding in plain sight.  With a repetition of ME.  

So more guessable than I expected.  But still a very cute puzzle. It went down nice and easy.  Hic.",9,neutral,0.5063443183898926

"This theme triggered the memory of an unforgettable moment of my life, probably the longest moment as well.

Ages ago I was working as a waiter in a steak house, and on this night, I was serving a four-top of men in suits.  Everything had gone smoothly through the main course, and they were sitting with coffee.  I came around with a carafe to top up their cups, and was behind one of the guests when my to stubbed against a crease in the carpet and a dollop of steaming joe spilled out and landed on his shoulder.  Nobody saw this happen.

Now this scalding liquid had some distance to go before reaching this guest‚Äôs shoulder.  It had to soak through the jacket, shirt, and perhaps an undershirt as well.  This was that longest moment, that agonizing wait, two seconds probably, that felt like an eternity.  I was frozen, speechless, helpless, not knowing what to do.

Oh, the burn came, I saw a moment of confusion on his face, then he rubbed his shoulder with his hand, quickly stood and looked at me, jaw dropped, as I profusely apologized.

It all ended well (I paid for having his suit cleaned), but what I will never forget is that moment of waiting, waiting, waiting for the coffee to travel through the layers.

These are the moments that add texture to a life.  Now I laugh about it.  It makes for a good story, and thank you for triggering it, Joe, with your DRINKS ON ME theme!",31,positive,0.8084685206413269

"Nice Monday puzzle. Across, down, across again and... I finished. Cute theme and a smooth solve - not quite a record time for me, but close.

First answer history search today was for RIVERMOUTH. Two previous appearances and... both times it was also used to imply VERMOUTH.  In one puzzle it was paired up with:

extravirGIN and diaperservICE, with the reveal being DRYMARTINI. 

Then the other puzzle - a quite amazing Sunday from March 9, 2008 by Patrick Berry with the title: ""Splits and mergers."" Tough to describe the amazing trick in that one. Here's one try: 

79d: riV (with the clue being - ""See 90 across""
with the V crossing 90a at: dryVermouth
And the clue for 90a: 
""Martini ingredient / Delta site [merger] ""

A couple of other examples: Down and across with the crossing letter in caps: 

down: foreS (so the implied answer is FORESTRANGER)
across: dontbeaStranger

across: notificAnhelpit
down: Ation (so the implied answer is NOTIFICATION)

A couple of other pairs:
down: cleAnslate
across: trAnslate

across: eventhOrizon

"Intriguing subtheme: Japan in WWII with Enola (Gay), the B-29 that dropped the A-bomb on Hiroshima, Iwo (Jima), the month-long battle exactly 74 years ago, and while the B-29 was a four-engine plane, the B-25s and B-26s used over Japan were twin engine planes -- with Japan as one of the AXIS powers, and at the other end of the diagonal axis: Utah, as in Utah Beach, where the Allies engaged the Germans at Normandy. The proximity of Exes and Axis tickled me; there is indeed a band called Exes of Evil (thanks, google). Also, did you know that kamikaze pilots performed a special ceremony before flying including drinking SAKE and eating rice? Hasta la vista! 

I wonder whether any of Henry VIII's wives could be called EXES. At least two of his marriages were annulled, and he only had two of his six wives killed. Anne Boleyn was beheaded (she is one of Henry's ...axes) as was Catherine Howard, but there is compelling speculation that Catherine of Aragon, whose marriage to Henry was annulled but who died very young (36) by no apparent cause, was poisoned. 

In any case, if Henry VIII bellied up to the bar, got out his royal wallet, turned to any of the women in his vicinity, proclaiming aloud in the sudden subdued silence, ""Drinks on me,"" this would cause quite a bit of UNEASE in the crowd. If you bought him home to dine with the folks, saying, ""Mom, dad, this is my fiancee, Henry, he wants to make me his queen!"" no mother will afterwards whisper in your ear ""He's a keeper!""",18,neutral,0.6342368125915527
