"I enjoyed this.

As someone who is old enough to have played with Mr. POTATO HEAD sets that came with wooden features that you would stick into your own potato, I expect certain generational clues that I just won't know. I'm looking at you, Li'l UZI Vert and SUZIE.

My favorite clue/answer combo? Even though my Detroit connections lead me to BELLE Isle, which New Yorkers might like to know was also designed by Frederic Law Olmstead, my favorite was definitely 9D: -- EMDASH. I'm surprised nobody else has mentioned it yet.

Thanks!",8,positive,0.7830485701560974
Fabulous! Thanks Dominic Grillo. I never had one and always loved visiting friends who did. Happy to know 55D and TIL 27A (from the crossings). What a great Thursday puzzle.,5,positive,0.983491837978363
"Uber nostalgic one today!

Obviously, the main theme, but I loved that the parts were all over the place. Because no child ever, in the history of the universe, didn‚Äôt put a smile or mustache on the forehead and a hand where the nose *should* be‚Ä¶

But also that as a wimpy drinker, the only wine I could handle in my 20‚Äôs was white ZIN. 
Now I far prefer a ZIN. The other stuff is way too sweet!

Fun Thursday! 
Thank you!",9,positive,0.9431766867637634
"One of my more enjoyable projects in commercial RE development was in the lovely central valley town of Lodi,CA, where I met several fine and lovely people, and was introduced to an ancient wine varietal that grows particularly well in that climate: zinfandel.

What a coincidence! The morning off, what better way to spend it than solving the NYTXW, hanging with Deb and my Wordplay buds, a piece of avocado toast, then off for a walk on a CERTAIN URBAN RIVERINE ISLAND PARK! My plans, no lie! If the weather were a little warmer, I'd bike there.

Thanks for the POTATO HEAD fun fact.  I had forgotten about this, though I was 10 years old(e) when Hasbro introduced the plastic potato shape.  For everyone's viewing pleasure, here's a pre-1964 Hasbro commercial using real spuds as well as other vegetables:

Too many googles and one flat out cheat (looked up the NYT answer) to count this one, so I'll go into 'no google' mode tomorrow which I'm sure will end my current (very short) streak.

"Might be a case of a puzzle that was too cute for its own good. Fun, nostalgic theme. 
But I was a bit thrown off by the fact that 'smile' in circles is actually smile shaped, and some of the others (hat for example) are just...there?
Not to mention the obscure fill-in-the-blank nouns. 

This one had me rearranging my face a bit, trying to determine how I felt about it!",21,positive,0.6605381965637207
"This was an otherwise easy puzzle with ridiculously hard spots. I usually take care to make it clear my complaints are subjective, but today I will risk it and say that the naticky N section with several proper names crossing was just unfair. I knew CAMILLA but not any of the other names, so I was forced to look stuff up. That did not feel great. 

I was confused by ZIN. Now I see below that it was short for zinfandel... Jesus, I would never have come up with that, and it's not like I don't drink wine. Do you really shorten every other word to something unrecognizable to non-Americans? Or was this just crosswordese? 

That part of the puzzle was hard for me also because even though I think I had once known skinny could mean INFO, today I could not come up with that for the life of me, and the quite arcane clueing of INS did not help in that general area, either.

I needed the column to get IST for ""Natural finish?""

"Fun puzzle! I caught on to the theme fairly early, and was able to gain some traction by filling in the circles. I love puzzles that give you two ways to solve‚Äî it‚Äôs just that much more satisfying when you discover the trick. 

I still got stuck in a few places, though, and had to look up ADELEH, ARHAT and UZI so I could keep going. I hate doing that, but you don‚Äôt know what you don‚Äôt know until you learn it. And now I know all three of those things, so I still consider it a win!

ARHAT / HOSTA. Had the play the alphabet game with the H. but thankfully, there were no other errors. 

Thought this was a pangram. But I guess J and K are missing?

I appreciate the creativity. The clues seemed sufficiently hard given there was no ‚Äòtrick‚Äô. But the clue for 9Down did throw me for a while. It seemed like standard Thursday clueing.

"I did not have a Potato Head toy as a child, but I still enjoyed this fun puzzle. My favorite part was that none of the ""parts"" were in the correct spot, so it had the feel of a child's creative play.  :)

I found a number of the clues and answers difficult, so this was not a speedy finish for me, but it was not so difficult that it felt like a slog. Some of the crosses in the SE corner were a little rough though.",16,positive,0.9198886156082153
"The whole way through I kept thinking that I could never finish this puzzle, I hadn't a clue, much too hard, over my head, then, miraculously, the SW corner was done.  Other fills kept teasing me through, until there were only a few holes left.  I realized that I had no way of knowing any of the characters in Stranger Days, so trolled through the cast and it had to be SUZIE!  But I was still left with the nirvana ace and the shady plant, so back to Google to traverse a list of 20 of them. HOSTA!  HOSTA, you darling! Popped in the H and I was done. Not so ARCANE after all, and without much AGE GAP INFO or pop GENRE know how necessary.  Watching while the crosses filled up the crosses was delightful.

"OL√Å de Portugal! The music shocked me today. What!? I‚Äôm done already!?

I had to look up TSAI and PHILIVEY. I could have gotten the latter through crossings with a tad more patience. 

One of my favorite lines from Toy Story was when the then-Mr. POTATO HEAD saw Barbie zipping around in her pink sports car and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a married spud, I‚Äôm a married spud!‚Äù ü§£ I‚Äôve been there and I bet many of you have, too!

I think SIGNALBOX came to mind from my son‚Äôs childhood fascination with Thomas the Tank Engine and model wooden trains. He could tell you everything about the world of trains and spent hours configuring the tracks. How I miss those simpler times.

I had two absolute Naticks, UZI and SUZIE and ADELEH and BELLE, all fairly obscure references, and since three of them could have been clued less ARCANEly it seems like it would have been fair to make at least one of the references more accessible.
