"So, as an Eli who was at Yale during bladderball days ... it was crazy!  The bladderball was huge, I don't know where it was stored but once a year they would inflate it and roll it out onto the Old Campus a huge green in a quadrangle surrounded by freshmen dorms.  All Yale undergrads were affiliated with one of the (then) twelve residential colleges, and there were some rivalries.  So the actual bladderball event basically consisted of masses of people, some in t-shirts affiliated with their colleges, shoving this massive ball around.

I think the eventual goal was to roll it all the way to the President's house, about 1/2 mile away.

In my time there was a rivalry between my college (Saybrook) and the next college over (Branford) in which, on bladderball weekend during brunch, some Branford students sneaked into our dining hall and opened the windows looking out onto the Branford green, where Branford students with fire extinguishers filled with fish juice were waiting to spray the concoction into the dining hall.  I remember our Master and Dean and several other people got splashed.  I got fish juice on my favorite winter coat!

The following year, a group of 12 Saybrook students took revenge, but they went way over the line (I'll spare you the details); I think all were suspended, a couple had lawyer parents and sued, and it was a big mess.  That was around 1977.  So, not the proximate cause of Bladderball being canceled in 1982, I don't think.

"In music notation, a slur is this shape ) except turned 90 degrees left or right, placed over or under two or more note heads. As others have commented already, it means the notes contained by it are to be smoothly connected together, taken as a single phrase or idea.

The same sign has a different name and meaning when it is used to link two notes of the same pitch: a tie causes their rhythmic values to be added together into a single value. A half-note C tied to a dotted-quarter note C adds up to a value of 7 eighths, which there is no other way to write in modern notation. (Curiously, there was a single note with that duration in early music: a colored-in whole note!)

One of the important lessons I got from an early teacher is one that I earnestly pass on: a slur has two equally important meanings. One is taught, that the notes under it are connected and belong to each other. One is largely ignored: that those notes are separated from the notes before and after the slur.",5,neutral,0.8645331263542175

But dang, I am impressed by how totally arcane that thing was for me. Bladderball, ELIS...

"It all went very quickly until I hit a dead end in the NE corner.  I was unfamiliar with MAGE but I presume it's the singular of 'magi' which is sometimes translated at magicians.  John Fowles wrote 'The Magus' which was a superb novel and maybe MAGE seeks to be the ungendered word because Magus is clearly masculine.

"Jacob McDermott has provided us with a breezy, entertaining puzzle.

5-Down, viz. ""They're proven to be true"", whose answer was THEOREMS, got me thinking.

Of course, the answer is correctly clued, but until 1993 there was a famous ""theorem"", Fermat's last theorem, (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat's_Last_Theorem) which defied proof since it was proposed about 358 years ago.

Yet people continued to refer to this, once unproved statement, as a ""theorem"" because they were so sure that it was a true statement and, indeed, Andrew Wiles finally proved it circa 1994.

One other somewhat related thought, very roughly speaking, there are true mathematical statements which provably ""cannot be proved"" in a very well-defined sense. Such statements are referred to as ""undecidable statements (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems)."" So, in a very rough sense, these are ""theorems"" which cannot be proved.",8,positive,0.661956787109375
"Interesting about UPS drivers.

ELKS sounds a little funny to me but it is valid. The plural can be ELKS or ELK and I‚Äôm used to the latter.

"Deb, money well spent. The Overstory is a fine novel, and very affecting; there is quite a bit of sadness in its leaves, be forewarned, and while trees tie the book together, it is the varied stories of the humans that is most captivating. I hope you like it!

Liked the AHA MOMENT followed by SAY AH and that I was tempted to put ALCOHOL (same number of letters) as being responsible for making a drink alcoholic (and for that matter, making an alcoholic drink), like it was so obvious that maybe I was overthinking the overstory here. Like ""DIJH."" But in the end the music played without so much as a slur. 

I'm a little tired of ERTE being the only Deco artist permitted in these puzzles (perhaps CASSANDRE, LALIQUE or the sometimes used ICART), yet ERTES over TREES is so fetching an anagram that it was a beaut. And steep, soak, in hot water. Cuppa tea, Mr. Hyde?

I had to laugh seeing MAGE as answer to ""good speller,"" mainly because Puzzlemucker tinkered with that one a few days ago when the puzzle had all those wonderful --ER misdirects and puns. If I remember, PM's was ""bad speller"" ... Crazy how that happens!

The stores analogy seems a little outdated. I would say Chain Store:: David; AMAZON:: Goliath would be more truthful. 1990's calling: they want their clue back. 

Say, ah...I should let it ride. This one definitely passes the smell test, and I'm a guy who gags around oinks and mulch. Anyway this was double OK by me, nothing kinda sorta about it. Plus, tatertots!",37,positive,0.8126804828643799

"Not sure how I feel about Ares being hinted with Marvel.

Marvel has very famous and prominent deities with 4 letter names - Thor, Odin, Loki - all appearing across several movies and TV shows. Ares only appears in the comics.

And Ares appears in DC movies, in probably their biggest hit at that, Wonder Woman. I don't think he ever makes an appearance in a Marvel movie. His presence is much more prominent in the DC universe, and predates the Marvel Ares by over 2 decades.

Yes, on a technicality, Ares is in the Marvel Universe, but unless this was a deliberate choice to mislead, it should either be DC Universe, or at the very least, both the Marvel and DC Universes.",51,neutral,0.8144897818565369
"This was a very ""talkative"" puzzle. And by that I mean, it's packed with spoken phrases and sayings -- words that should be set apart by quotation marks:

Maybe even AHA MOMENT.

By contrast, there's very little culture -- ARES, ERTES, UTA, SNL, SEA, THY -- and the clues are pretty tame IMHO.

Example: ARES - pretty much any god appears in the Marvel (or DC) universe; both comic book publishers like working in the pantheons as super-powered beings. Now they're just waiting for their MOVIE DEAL in the equivalent cinematic universe.

"I was definitely not on the constructor‚Äôs wavelength tonight.  After trying the acrosses, I was nearly blinded by the glare from the remaining white squares, but I kept ATIT and had my flash of inspiration, or AHAMOMENT, if you will, and the puzzle came together nicely.

I‚Äôve obviously absorbed too much Simpsons-speak because I immediately entered doh instead of DUH, which kept me from identifying MULCH as the bed material in question.  Ultimately the gardener in me prevailed, and those answers unlocked the SE and finished the job.

I think the latest cold snap accompanied by our first measurable snow in quite some time will spell the end for the brave daffodil that bloomed just before Christmas and persisted into the new year.  It‚Äôs not unusual for daffodils to be poking slightly above ground this time of year, but this is the first time in 30 years in Ardmore that one has actually bloomed before late February.  A small collateral benefit of climate change I guess.  I wonder if it will survive to next year without the benefit post bloom recuperation time.",15,neutral,0.5849910378456116
