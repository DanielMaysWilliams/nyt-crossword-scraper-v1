Just kidding -- there isn't any breathless suspense to take away.

I tried to guess why the H thing was happening.  No ""two H"" or ""Double-H"" phrase came to mind.  That's because there isn't one -- just as there isn't any revealer to explain/justify the theme.

Thank you, Peter and Bruce. So entertained by your heroic handling of hick hop and ham hocks - smarty pants indeed!",16,positive,0.978779137134552
"I‚Äôm not liking ‚Äúyeah‚Äù as the answer for the clue Hooray (51D).  People screw up yea, yeah, and yay so much maybe the definitions have changed?",14,negative,0.8833590149879456

"Finished and only needed help with a couple letters, I‚Äôm very proud of myself! Fishy got me, I‚Äôll blame it on being the last corner I worked on today. A few too many names for my taste but I was able to get them all, including the football guy.",5,positive,0.9623117446899414
"enjoyable and clever! I saw the grid art and noticed that all the clues started with H, but it wasn't until I finished that I saw that the them answers were all double H terms.  Good work, constructors!  And I love doing the puzzle the night before, so it's one thing off my list the next morning.",5,positive,0.9657232165336609
Can't say this was my favorite Wednesday. 1D really sums up my feelings for this puzzle.,41,positive,0.9309993982315063

"Happy holidays, everyone! Loved how beautiful the double-H monogram looked in the center of the grid. Holy Heck, I said to myself, how handsome!

We were just talking at lunch today about presidential gaffes and I mentioned my favorite was when, in a tribute,  Jimmy Carter called his late near-great VP ""Hubert Horatio Hornblower Humphrey."" Ha!

In contrast, Biden's gaffe's are pretty ho-hum.

I was about to enter ""RAP"" for ""Hammer sound"" when I realized I had used it already. Xwordinfo says the only other time Hammer sound was the clue (June 13, 1997) the answer was indeed Rap. 

Anyway, this was a dazzling puzzle, worthy of POW honors for sure. But remember: heavy is the head that wears the crown.",16,positive,0.9328051209449768
"Didn't get it until I read the column but really liked the idea of all clues starring with H and the H theme in general. Not a fan of some of the crosswordese /nonsense fill like TEC, STS, STE - could've done without it.",28,neutral,0.5953214168548584
"Yeesh! Two sports clues in the SW corner. Ugh. Yet, somehow I finished this puzzle without looking anything up.",9,negative,0.6638391017913818

Never heard of EVO",25,neutral,0.5421648621559143
"I hereby nominate the clue to 62A as clue of the year.

I'm expecting to see it on Lewis's list on Monday.
