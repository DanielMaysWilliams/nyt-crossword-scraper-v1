"Loved this one, Adam! The theme answers felt really tight: elegant and unforced. I love a Monday puzzle that doesn't seem basic! 

I almost didn't read the constructor notes, but now that I did, I'm here to root for some Adam Wagner themeless grids!! C'mon, if you can stretch and make an ""easy"" (Monday) theme this lovely, surely you can bring that same composer's eye to Friday/Saturday! Perhaps a way of easing into it is to permit yourself a ""mini theme"" -- you know, where some subject just happens to crop up more than once.  ...My vote is for chocolate, always!

"A crosswords-in-general comment.

There was a piece in yesterday’s Times about the value of fostering intergenerational understanding by bringing older and younger people together – which results in benefits for both.

I see that in crosswords.  When I solve a puzzle made by one in their teens or 20’s, say, it provides a glimpse into the world as they see it and into the way they think.   I find that so enriching; it broadens the way I see things.  

In the puzzle comments, I often hear the olds complaining about puzzles by the youngs, and vice versa, and it makes me sad.  This promotes us-them thinking and begets tension and stress.

Thing is, when unfamiliar not-part-of-my-generation words appear in a grid, the Times puzzle team is so good, that they make sure that these answers are fairly crossed.  

These words can be bridges rather than moats.  They, in my view, are precious gifts, and may they continue!",61,positive,0.5715171694755554

"This was a perfect candidate for the Guess The Revealer game I like to play, where I fill in the puzzle except for the revealer, don’t read the clue for it, and try to figure out what it is.  It creates an extra layer of riddle that makes the puzzle more compelling.

So, there I was looking at the ONE-TWO-THREE-FOUR theme answers, wrestling my brain, trying to find some connection anywhere.  Totally stymied.  I went to step two – read the clue to the revealer, which led me to look at what was counted in the second word of each theme answer.

At first, I thought it was vowels, because that worked for the first two theme answers.  But no.  Nor did consonants work.  When SYLLABLES finally hit me, well, I have to say, that was one sweet I GOT IT moment.  And right after the spontaneous “Hah!” and “Aha!” it wrought, my whole being was flooded with praise for what hits me as a most original and splendid theme, and filled with respect and gratitude for being so superbly outwitted.

The cherry on top was when I saw GONZO and BEANS in that little SE corner, and my brain shouted “Garbanzo!”

One clue made me cry 😭 like a toddler: WAWA. Not because I didn’t like it but rather because I am reminded that I won’t be eating a delicious hoagie or bowl of soup from WAWA any time soon 😩.  

If you have lived in Pennsylvania or New Jersey and then moved away from the region (or country, in my case) you may understand. You’d get a little rumble in the tummy but it’d be easily resolved by pulling into your nearest WAWA and ordering on that wonderful little kiosk. Then you’d stroll over and make yourself a huge coffee with a plethora of creams and other fixins. Go pay for it all, and then grab your food and go. How I miss that!!

In Portugal, where I otherwise happily live, one goes to a cafe or restaurant and properly sits down to eat for ridiculously long, relaxing time. No wait staff will bother you until you ask. The food is fresh, and the coffee was just beans just moments ago. The bill will be shockingly inexpensive.
