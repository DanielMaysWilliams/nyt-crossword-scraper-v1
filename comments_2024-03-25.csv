Agree about Sam.  I enjoy her writing.  I can imagine it is no easy task to make the columns interesting day in and day out, but she manages to do so.

Emu emu.  Emu.

"Another reason why I love Monday through Wednesdays in Crosslandia:  SAM.

For starters, look at the picture she gave us today, the underwater musicians, an image playing off the clue [Reef composition].  Wordplay right from the start.

Sam sprinkles wordplay throughout her columns, and I never know when it’s going to come, only that I’m going to like it, in a range from a groan underscored with pleasure to an out-loud “Hah!”

So right off, the she's is an entertainer.  She’s also a color commentator, throwing in facts, interesting and sometimes from left field, like today’s Hawaiian fish, accompanied by Don Ho.

Furthermore, she delivers what she’s supposed to deliver: Explaining clues and themes.  But it’s never dry; it’s like she’s your buddy, sitting across the table from you.

She’s one-of-a-kind, her words are saturated with humor and wit, and, IMO, she’s not to be missed.  What a marvelous chaser to the puzzle.  Sam, you’re a gift, a day-brightener, and I’m so very grateful for you.",20,positive,0.9493622183799744
"“Spring has finally sprung in New York.”  Oh man, Sam. Way to rub in the difference between The City and the state.  I just snowblowed (snow blew?) more than a foot of the wettest, most obnoxious snow that I have ever snowblowed (snow blown?) off of our driveway.  Last week I planted grass seed in a t shirt. (Don’t, do not, ask me why I put the grass seed in a t shirt.)",22,neutral,0.4757963716983795
