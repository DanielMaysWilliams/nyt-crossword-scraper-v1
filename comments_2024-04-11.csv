Then 'got' FOOD[P]REP[A]RATION & thought What! Not S? Not 2 P's? 2 diff ltrs??

As I neared finish I got a bit grumbly: ""If secret added letters don't spell out sumthin then it isn't THAT clever!"". Dunno why I felt so demanding, as it's overall such a good puzzle!

Played Clue as a kid but all I recall is Prof Plum, lead pipe, Library etc. But the puzzle made things solvable. Some TIL's, even if unknown, were crossed fairly & let things flow‚Äî but w/a wonderful crunch! Excellent Thurs!

TIN was another interesting TIL.

MOOR evoked nostalgia, read/liked Baskervilles as a kid (for school?).

"Very clever.  This goes into the (small) running list I'm keeping for POY because, as you know, I won't remember it otherwise.  But it's going in with an asterisk: more pop culture names than I tend to like.

Even though I know nothing about the game ""Clue"", I picked up FOOD (P)REP(A)RATION immediately.  So, too, with COURTSIDE SEATS.  This is because even though I have severe puzzle weaknesses in the pop culture arena, I'm very strong on word pattern recognition. 

OTOH, MAN EATING SHARK was extremely well disguised, I wasn't expecting it that as an answer, and I wasn't helped at all by not knowing ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" location nor Walt's meth-dealing partner.  (I hadn't gotten to the SHARK answer at 62A yet.)

Was the crossing of the assorted names fair?  Since I didn't have to cheat to finish, I'd have to say yes.

A solving aid that worked for me:  I put a small dot in the margin before the 1st, 4th, 12th and 15th rows right after reading the revealer.  This helped me immediately know what I was looking for.

It seems that since the draft is seemingly but a bad dream for many of us Boomers, it did exist.  ENLISTED is in no way a draft status, nor was it ever referenced in that manner.  While serving in the US Army, my serial number, as an enlisted soldier, started with RA, those drafted, US.  Draft status was a number and letter code, such as 1A, 4F, etc.
As a medical practitioner previously pointed out, blood is drawn from VEINs, but shots (or ‚Äújabs‚Äù as our medically challenged governor refers to them in his sneeringly derogatory way) are given intramuscularly.
Finally, LICE do not a scratch the head.  They cause the itch that we alleviate by scratching.  Take it from one who knows.

Took a while to figure out the rest; the bottom entry falling last just because we don‚Äôt call building stock REAL ESTATE here, so it just never occurs to me.

The other thought I had was that perhaps the clue for the revealer was too revealing and would have been better worded "" . . . or a hint to four rows of this puzzle.""

"Dan likes midweek.  Two of his five NYT puzzles are Wednesdays and three are Thursdays.  He also likes gimmicks.  For instance, one of his puzzles ( https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=2/1/2023 ) had three extraterrestrial vehicles, one beaming up a cow, one a man, and one a car.  So, the machinations of today‚Äôs puzzle don‚Äôt surprise me.

Much skill went into producing this.  The theme answer in the top row, for example, has three words, their letter counts being 4-3-6, which means the theme answer in the bottom row must have a count of 6-3-4 to meet the requirements of symmetry.  But not only that, only certain letters could go into the black squares of those rows.

Tough, tough, tough to find answers that would work, and work smoothly!

Most importantly, how was the solve? Sweet! For me, there was a terrific ‚ÄúHah!‚Äù when the theme became clear, and the SW fought me hard there for a while ‚Äì much to my brain‚Äôs delight.  Other territory filled out in a swoop ‚Äì much to my brain‚Äôs delight.

"As some of you know, I spent most of Monday driving to and (mostly) back* from the totality path of the eclipse, so I had some light TV viewing to try to catch up on last night. So I decided to solve while also watching some recorded stuff in the background.

Big mistake. By the end, I decided to just put the TV on pause until I finished.

I started by putting PREP in 1A. A slam dunk, right? But then 1D had to be FALCO, and 1A turned into FOOD because ANNO was a gimme, LICE made sense, and COURT kinda halfway made sense.

That's when I realized it was the return of the tricky Thursday that's been missing the past few weeks. I knew something was afoot with FOOD and COURT, but not quite what.

The big issue here was that the other two entries on each line weren't clued with hyphens this time. They had real clues, so it was less apparent that unorthodox tricks were at hand.

Well, eventually, I got the trick and filled in the first two.

But then, because I was splitting my attention, I completely forgot what was happening when I got to the bottom two. That made the SW corner a debacle for me.

Until I paused the TV, and said, ""Wait a minute!  I know what's wrong!"" Up till then, I couldn't figure out for the life of me why PRIMER was ""Valuable property"". Finally finished at nearly double my average, but it wasn't the puzzle's fault.

Multitasking is way overrated.

"I had a lot of fun with this one.  What was shocking for me was getting the trick on a sports related clue.  Almost everything I know about team sports comes to me from crosswords.  

For whatever reason, I had trouble seeing MAN EATING SHARK.  I was a little stuck with JLO crossing JESSE until I got the SSE, guessed at JESSE, and then saw that JLO looked familiar.

"Dear Editor,

Clueing is everything, and this one was clued poorly.  The Times used to be better and more challenging than this.  This is the 4th time I‚Äôve commented in as many weeks, and it seems that the direction for harder days is heading more towards the clue creator wanting to impress the clue creator more than wanting to  impress the solver.
