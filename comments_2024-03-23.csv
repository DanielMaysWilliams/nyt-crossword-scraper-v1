"Sam Ezersky and I do not inhabit the same wheelhouse. Our brains do not work the same or have the same associations. He includes words I consider dubious at best and the words he neglects are indicative of a young man who thinks what he doesn't know isn't worth knowing. I know I shouldn't get offended over puzzles but I detect an arrogance in him that I don't get from Will Shortz, who manages to be more playful, more elegant. and more inclusive. When I miss one of Shortz's clues it's actually fun to see how I failed and the twisted way his mind works, while it feels like Ezersky is smugly laughing at me for not being cool enough to get it. Weirdly his attitude is reminiscent of Eugene Maleska's. who was famously off-putting for his obscure vocabulary and assumption of an elitist body of knowledge. Like Maleska, Ezersky seems more interested in asserting his authority - I'm the editor and you're not, deal with it - than in genuinely wanting to play with us the way Shortz manages to convey.

"Good morning, all!

I always pop by the comments section on my own puzzles, because the discourse is invaluable. Normally I'm just a lurker, but today I figure I'd chime in with just couple thoughts:

1) My personal constructor style is to give you one heckuva Saturday workout, knowing that at times it'll be polarizing. So of course your mileage may vary! If this one wasn't your cup of tea, no worries, and no need to hold back; just hope you'll enjoy tomorrow's offering, or next Saturday's, whichever ... the editor in me wants something for everyone.

2) Regarding the constructor notes, the goal here certainly wasn't to come off with excessive self-praise. It's a privilege to both create and edit puzzles for The Times, and feel like I owe it to y'all to peel back the curtain more: My thought process behind the construction, but also some of the hallmarks our team seeks in (what we hope are) good, enjoyable puzzles. I hope this clarifies things better!

Forever grateful for the compliments, and also the incisive feedback.

So, on the theory of ‚Äúbetter late than never,‚Äù here goes:

First, kudos to @Deb Amlen for being willing to buck the convention that the column must only say nice things about the puzzle. I thought it was enormously refreshing to read her piece. To me, it modeled constructive criticism: she acknowledged that she was expressing her own opinion (rather than an objective Truth about the puzzle‚Äôs quality) and she explained why she thought it fell short. The fact that there was so much blowback, to me, was more a function of how rare such gentle criticism is (and therefore how ‚Äúout of character‚Äù it was) rather than being justified by what she actually wrote. In particular, calling it a ‚Äúdiatribe‚Äù as some did was ridiculous. 

Second: While I wanted to share my view, I could have saved space by just writing: What @Tito said (in yesterday‚Äôs comment section).

ALL THAT has a more negative connotation than ""Legit,"" in my experience (as in ""He thinks he's all that""), and glances are what one typically steals, rather than PEEKs. Perhaps that's it: Sam's clues tend to strip words of their connotations and common usages, so I don't get that rush of pleasure from ""Oh! I never thought of that word that way!""

ABBA is a word in English, but it is not a word in English as clued in the puzzle. As others starting with Steve have noted, plurals in Hebrew are not created by adding an S, so ABBAS is not ""Fathers, in Hebrew."" ABBAS as an answer would be fine with another clue.

‚Ä¢ Looking at the grid afterward, only a few no-knows, and yet it was chip, chip, chip, from beginning to end, due to devilish cluing. Much time spent waiting for my brain to make the right connection, and fist pumps when it did.  Footholds were precious.
‚Ä¢ OMG, the freshness!  That SW stack is all NYT answer debuts.  That NE stack has one debut and two answers that have only appeared once in the NYT puzzle.  Five debuts elsewhere in the puzzle and many, many hardly-used answers to boot.  This puzzle pops!
‚Ä¢ Lovely answers all over: WHY SHOULD I, SAFETY NET, ANGEL FALLS, STOLE A PEEK, KISSY, ELOCUTE, BE GENTLE, TORPOR, LET IT GO.
‚Ä¢ Deep bow at [Take, as a pointer] for DOGNAP.

"BOXFISH and THALAMI? GENO SMITH? Gimme a break.

I ran a calligraphy business as a sideline because I love the physical act of writing, so that's why I continue to solve pen on paper. Therefore, I tend to not fill in an answer unless I'm fairly certain it's correct. I thought STRIPSTEAK, THUNBERG, and AUDIOBOOKS were probably right, but that was only the NE.

I loved the clue for DOGNAP, but many were diabolical, so it's hard to pick a favorite.

15A reminded me of when I cut my husbands hair out on our deck during the pandemic.

After 9 months of solving these puzzles I am beginning to be able to tackle most of the hard ones, and it feels pretty good üôÇ.

I am sure veteran solvers enjoyed the hell out of this, and I hope one day I will be able to do puzzles like today's without any help. I'm slowly getting there.

The only clue I was sort of disappointed with was 'Trace of music' - it ended up being just another proper name clue, and of the worst kind, with the capital letter obfuscated.
