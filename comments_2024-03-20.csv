Wonder if there will be a SIEGE in Jerusalem next month during passover.  Probably not.  I guess that's just reserved for those in Gaza trying to observe Ramadan.  At least those silly Gazans don't have to eat during the day!  Hopefully we can start razing Rafah during Eid!

"Very nice debut, Ms. Capassakis, and how wonderful to have had two favorite teachers to inspire you!

Mullion got me to thinking about Muntins, and I can never remember the subtle difference between them, but I think muntins are the ones that separate smaller panes of glass in, say, a ""six over six"" sash window. But I think most of us use Mullions, and the rest of us eat Mutton.

Karel came easily, but I wondered why the famous bridge across the Vltava in Prague is called Karlovy Most, and discovered that -ov is a possessive ending.  Like Karlovy Vary, the old spa town of Carlsbad, or Warmbad. Named for the same Charles as the guy who commissioned the bridge, plus he was the Holy Roman Emperor. So thanks for prompting me to seek out that clarification. And making me want to go back to Czechia for the waters.

"Oh, Sam, false dichotomy.  Since when have creative expression and math/logic been separate endeavors?  Where would music be without rhythm? Where would physics be without creative speculation?",40,negative,0.5211232900619507
"I enjoyed the numerical clues in this puzzle.  My only real stumble was mopup for sponge instead of MOOCH, but I was able to sort that out in a reasonable time.

I did like seeing virtuoso banjo player (banjoist?) Bela Fleck make an appearance in the clues. Although a master of traditional bluegrass music, he has done much to make the banjo an instrument that‚Äôs comfortable in a variety of musical settings from African music to jazz and everything in between.  His album with Chick Corea features spectacular playing by both of them.  His wife, Abigail Washburn, is an accomplished banjo player too. Proving that opposites attract, he most often plays in the three finger picking style popularized by Earl Scruggs, while she plays the older clawhammer style.  Both of them whether together or apart are worth a listen.",17,positive,0.9384209513664246
I haven't been this angry at a puzzle in a while. The north west was ridiculous.,5,negative,0.9225968718528748
"I can never remember if it is NEMEA or NaMEA where Hercules slayed THE BEAST.  If I HAD TO, I could probably find that INFO in an INTRO CLASS.  WHOA, what an IDEA!

"Well, it was a perfectly fine puzzle, but to me, this was more like a themeless that just had some clues that were numbers.  There's nothing unifying about the numbers except the fact that they are indeed numbers.",18,neutral,0.48038849234580994
