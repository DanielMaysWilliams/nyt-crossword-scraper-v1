I, for one, enjoy Deb’s digressions. Makes her column fun.  Compare it to, for example, the boring Connections column.",8,positive,0.7657415866851807
"@festy 

The whole Doctor Who digression is just Deb's fangirl obsession with practically anything on the telly that comes from the UK.  The Doctor is not anywhere in the puzzle, and you don't need to know anything about that show to do it.

(Personally, I like Sex Education and Derry Girls, and I'm starting on the original Ghosts, called Ghosts UK over here.)",2,neutral,0.46936944127082825
"This is the type of puzzle that I often solve without catching on to the theme, answering the themed clues with a shrug and plowing ahead.  But today I caught on at GALLEON and enjoyed the aha moment.

I was happy to see Jennifer Egan grace the puzzle with an appearance.  For my money she is one of our finest contemporary novelists, and I heartily recommend A Visit From The Goon Squad and its sequel, Candy House.  Goon Squad is a particularly apt reference in this puzzle because in the broadest sense it’s about time and the story makes many leaps back and forth in time.",13,positive,0.8343919515609741
"Deb Amiens, you are a kindred spirit!  Once I caught the clever trick, my first thought was of the Doctor and how much I loved the anniversary special.  Thursday puzzles are the best!",11,positive,0.9829695224761963
"@Sean Sheer Me too, as someone who is very much not into sci-fi, I was somewhat thrown by the revealer clue, and wrote the whole thing off early thinking I just wouldn't get it. I did, with some crosses and yes the help of the column, actually found the concept clever. But perhaps a clue that didn't sway toward the sci-fi genre would have been better. I've watched and enjoyed time travel movies that I would not have put into that genre.
I'm still a newbie in relative sense (only been doing these since July) and also a  non-US player, although my two weeks there last year has been more help than I would have thought. For both of these reasons, I don't consider having to check the column a fail, it teaches me new words and ways to read a clue. I can do early week puzzles without lookup now, which I could not back in July. Eventually I'll get Thurs - Sun under my belt too.",17,neutral,0.5035797357559204
"One of my favorite David Tennant performances was in the PBS mystery series ""Broadchurch"" which ran for three seasons between 2013 and 2017.  He starred alongside Olivia Colman, who also was fantastic (of course).  As a bonus, the series (at least the exterior shots) was filmed in Dorset in southwest England, and the scenery is spectacular.  Well worth watching if you're a fan of British mysteries!",36,positive,0.9864618182182312
So good to know there are Doctor Who fans are on the Crossword staff! I 'm excited about Tennant too!,24,positive,0.9873290061950684
