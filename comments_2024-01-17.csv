"I find questions about names of Winnie the Pooh characters very hard, even though I know the stories quite well, as they are popular with kids over here, too, or at least they were in my childhood. What's the problem then? The Polish translation.

Given the, to put it mildly, unusual names of all characters in the English text, the only way to translate the books was to have equally unusual names in Polish, possibly in the spirit of the original, but completely different otherwise. Pooh himself became... Kubu≈õ Puchatek (in Polish Puch- sounds like Pooh; and since there is no name similar to Winnie in Polish, Pooh became... Jake, say, since Kubu≈õ is one of the diminutives for Jacob - Jakub - in Polish; Puchatek indicates he is fluffy - puch=fluff), Eeyore became K≈Çapouchy (one with the droopy ears), etc.

So today some product I have never heard before (I have no idea what SANKA is, but given its slogan it must be some horribly, industrially mistreaded coffee not on sale in Poland for food safety reasons) crossing with the English name of a Pooh character I have never seen or heard before was my personal natick. At least the missing letter was easy to figure out.

I really enjoyed this one as well.  One of my faster Wednesdays but i think it was a Potter-like mind meld that allowed some subtle or tricky answers to pop out of my head!  Sanka‚Ä¶ Askafter‚Ä¶ Lariat‚Ä¶ Hold Dear‚Ä¶. It felt great to finish it!,10,positive,0.980246365070343
"I already love me a Wednesday puzzle as it is, but give me one like today's and I'm in heaven.

Caught on to how to come up with the dash fills at HOLD DEAR, and it was a splendid solve from there on out.

The only glitch was at the crossing of LARI _T and DO _S I DO.  
Never heard the former and couldn't parse the latter because my brain was stuck on seeing do-si-do. 
Took a shot at the ""A"" and -- 
oh, DO AS I DO. Doh! (Nothing like a good laugh, even if it's at my own foibles..)

Such a well-constructed, intelligently clued, and satisfying puzzle.
Thank you, Mr. Mendelson!",28,positive,0.9604422450065613
"What an L of a puzzle -- AGAIN!! This time figurative Ls, as opposed to literal Ls, although they are that, too. 

BUT IS IT ART? -- Loved that. A question both to mock for its pretentiousness and to ponder for its answer. My friend Pat had a baby, we'll call him Reese. Pat loved art, loved going to museums, to galleries, to openings, and would drag baby Reese around with him starting when Reese was six months old. Reese enjoyed it, from what we could tell--he was a tactile kid, liked to look at things, handle things, get involved. He kept being told, especially at the museums, to keep his hands to himself, etc.  And when he was one and a half (or should I say half past one?), we all heard him utter his first sentence when some doting friend tried to pick him up: ""Don't touch me I'm art.""  We were all like: Whaaaaat???  Reese is probably in his early thirties now. And of course we still kid him about it, singin' ""U don't touch me!"" to MC Hammer's U Can't Touch This when we see him...which is usually at an art opening...

Anyways, this was a lively, cheery puzzle, with good humor and good intent. I felt challenged & enlivened by puzzlin' through, and even the glue words, ERR, ORCA and the like, had cluing with a bit of pizazz, which always redeems those words in my scoresheet. 

OK, Sam's photo choice is particularly challenging. They're on a SOFA? They're HOLDING DEAR little Toto there?  Did NOT come from different UTERI? Go from soda to ale without getting a ticket? Yeah no.",30,positive,0.8196422457695007

"fun puzzle, i went through it pretty quickly (for me) but then got stuck at the lower right corner. Could not get those words for a while. What is the hairy hoax associated with yeti? I'm thinking Star Wars but still don't get it.",5,neutral,0.4620758891105652
"I was sure this wasn't going to work for me, because I thought the ""-""s were going to be words that turned into some clever sentence, but I stepped back and let the ""-""s alone, and it literally fell into place..  Baffling until I stopped overthinking it.  

Thanks, M.J.M.  Nice puzzle.",15,negative,0.4119211733341217
"Hey, what about these entries in the puzzle that turn the other corners?

FUNKS SANKA: the drink you need when even coffee won‚Äôt cheer you up.

TACOS SEER: they will tell your future in exchange for two carne asada.

IRATE EDITH: she really doesn‚Äôt like your new adaptation of Ethan Frome.

PIBB BULLET: latest trend in energy drinks.",70,neutral,0.6367028951644897
"This one was so fun. Really interesting and very unique in my limited experience. Like a themeless with a twist. No real theme. No real revealer. Just a series of confounding dashes you need solve your way through.

It was HOLD DEAR that tipped me off, after my puzzle was 80% complete. I entered the D and thought, I guess HOLD kinda works for ‚ÄúCherish‚Äù?  And thats when I noticed the DEAR. Very cool. No ‚Äúbirds flying south‚Äù. Just some good old fashioned puzzle solving. (Birds flying south was also very cool, for the record)

Thanks for the good time, Morton J. Mendelson",21,positive,0.9502266049385071

"A fun little twist to the puzzle today! It didn't take too long before I picked up on the trick, and that helped to work on the other themers.

I'm just wondering that if we're tricky today, what's coming tomorrow?

Nice one, Morton; don't stay away so long!",20,positive,0.9712750315666199

"It's worth noting that Mr. Mendelson maximizes the number of twists in the puzzle. Out of the seven across answers that share an ending with the beginning of down answers, he twists all of them.

Pretty neat!",70,positive,0.8353660702705383
I didn't spot the semi-revealer at 39D until Sam pointed it out.  Loved the Potter clue although I am wise to that little trick and I saw it immediately.  15A Pre-nursing homes? was a great clue.  Good fun and a classic Wednesday - pitched just right IMO.,27,positive,0.9274001717567444

"I liked this for a Wednesday. I finished at about 2/3 my average, so it was slightly easier for me.

For any new solvers that might not be aware, a hyphen/dash as a clue usually indicates that the answer is a continuation of another answer. Usually it is horizontally on the same row, but today it was vertically, running on from the horizontal, which is a nice difference.",21,positive,0.924745500087738
