Check and check! 

I was a bit below average on this but I loved every moment! Especially loved the clues at 10a and 11d. I'm just not very fast. 

Plus, I made a very silly mistake at 34a and quickly typed in YOlk instead of YOKE. I do know the difference so it surprised me that I did that. Then again, my husband has a friend that he's helped with a lot of things recently. This friend happens to have a dozen hens, who happen to produce  a dozen eggs most days. I'm sounding like a math problem here...  Anyhow, in gratitude, said friend has been giving us many dozens of eggs every time he sees lately... that's at least twice a month. Last time she gave us 10 dozen! We are two people! So, now the yolk is on us! We are all egged out!! Who AMASSES this many eggs? WHO DOES THAT!?

SENIOR MOMENTS, btw, is one of the English language's great euphemisms.  If it didn't already exist, it would be necessary to invent it.  I use it all the time.

How nicely that goes with Jeanne Moreau's lovely (and oh-so-French) definition of AGE.  I love this kind of clue: one that provokes enormous curiosity the minute you read it.

Fortunately I had no SENIORMOMENTS while working this one out, and despite thinking I was stuck in the mud, actually finished well under my Friday average.

I enjoyed seeing Goya crop up. He was a true polymath.  He was a fine portraitist.  He made painting and etching powerful vehicles for political commentary, particularly against the inhumanity of war and the dangers of autocratic power.  And late in life his black paintings were a precursor to surrealism.  I have spent hours in the Prado, my favorite of the world’s great museums, admiring its vast collection of his works.  His art is just powerfully human.

I was also happy to see an appearance by another of my artistic heroes, Louis Armstrong, crop up via his sobriquet.  His Hot Fives and Hot Sevens created a template for jazz that remains in use to this day.  In addition to his virtuoso trumpet playing, his influence on jazz singing, or singing in general, cannot be overstated.",16,positive,0.9334228038787842

• I liked those SEED BANKS planted at the bottom.
• Gorgeous grid, with its photo album corners and super symmetry, a design that allows for the long answers to frame the grid, and for a bonus mini-puzzle in the middle.
• Getting a long answer with few crosses is one of the great moments in solving, IMO, and that happened a good number of times today.
• Robert can flat-out make a puzzle.  Clean short crosses in all four stacks, tough to pull off, and ten NYT debut answers – nine of them long! – for sparkle. (Hi, @RIA!)
• TURNED HEADS was apt for me, as I’m in the middle of reading “What An Owl Knows” by Jennifer Ackerman, an entertaining look at what I’m learning is a fascinating animal.

"The grid looked pretty daunting with all those long entries. Fortunately, it was not as tough as it looked, and was a fun solve.
 I had to put it down and come back to it a couple of times, but ultimately wound up finishing in about 3/4 my usual (unimpressive) Friday time.",12,neutral,0.3673502206802368
"What a brilliant puzzle, with virtuoso clues and satisfying fills. Intricate, but no look-ups necessary, and no SENIOR MOMENTS for me tonight. You have one very happy West Coast fan.  I hope your fifth puzzle is already scheduled to run and that we will see it soon. 

Right on, Robert Logan, I am indeed dazzled.",15,positive,0.9804090261459351
"There is a richness to this puzzle like a good cabernet and the shape lent itself to that: I peered into my glass and swirled it, watching the lees and dregs gather. Shipments and Senior moments supply a sonorous set of north-south bookends, as do coma and Goya for west-east, not to mention the half-reverse-rhymes of Party Tricks and Brickyard. Correct me if I'm wrong, but ""Coma"" was by Robin Cook, the author's first novel; he became a major author in the vein of Ludlum or Crichton, using his experience as a doctor to create a new sub-genre of medical thrillers, he's now largely forgotten though still alive and kicking. 

Sagan and Satan crossing, what fun, I'd much prefer them to be at the next presidential debate getting into whether we are all stardust or not, but as it is, it's a drag! I used to like to imitate Sagan going ""Billions and billions of..."" to amuse the kids until learning he NEVER said that phrase, just as Sherlock never said, ""Elementary my dear Watson,"" although I've been told by some very smart people that Henry Stanley did indeed say, ""Dr. Livingstone, I presume?"" Now it takes more than that to turn the heads of my kids, like barely running, that might do it. 

The proximity of Yamaha musical instruments and Wanna make a bet made me think of the Wanamaker grand organ, located in the Philadelphia Macy's and played twice a day, the largest playable pipe organ in the world, truly worth a visit!",28,positive,0.5270068049430847
"Boy I sure wasn't getting this one without the Wordplay column. I just could not get enough answers to start crunching my way through. Those long spans were impressive, but to tough for me to get on my own today.",11,negative,0.5749354958534241
"I had to make lots of (educated?) guesses, many of them right. Fun puzzle! Happy Friday!",13,positive,0.9826870560646057
"Very fun - I really enjoyed the cluing, especially ""Barely run"" LOL The grid felt intimidating at first, but it all fell into place nicely. Bravo!",37,positive,0.9832451343536377
"Really loved this puzzle. Like a game of Trivial Pursuit. A big circular board with a bit of trivia from each category. 

“Sports” is always a good category for me, and there was a fair bit of that. Shout out KLAY Thompson (Where you at, Dutch Iris)

TATTOO ARTISTS is all time.

i had a great time with this puzzle. Thanks, Robert Logan!",20,positive,0.9740879535675049
"This is quite a gem of a puzzle. The symmetry, the cuts in the center (or CENTRE?), the balance of fill, ... I could go on. Well done, Robert!

This was also a rather quick solve. The long phrases rolled right off my crossword tongue. In addition to the pairing of 10D and 12D noted by Deb, how about 10A -- WHO DOES THAT? and 53A -- TURNED HEADS?

And then there is the triplet of affirmations: I DO, AMEN, and AYE, plus a close cousin -- BID.

Lastly, this puzzle could have had a golf theme. In addition to RANGES and CADDIES, I could also add NARROWS THE GAP, 10A and 53A as crowd reactions, and maybe even SENIOR MOMENTS from the PGA Tour Champions.",17,positive,0.8883717060089111

1. Shape of puzzle
2. Shape of solve (sort of a corkscrew)
3. Some very lively cluing

"A very nice puzzle, with style and substance.",14,positive,0.9659057855606079
My first thought was “donut”! My second was “this looks hard”. But this was an enjoyable (though quick) solve with some clever clues and sparkly answers.,11,positive,0.8834729790687561
Very quick for me - once I got going it just seemed to flow.  Beautiful grid.,26,positive,0.9775671362876892
"Glad we didn't need slashes for any of the boxes. 
(Of course we didn't need them yesterday either, but...)

Needed just a bit of time 
to get on Robert Logan's wavelength, 
but no SENIOR MOMENTS.

Not too many RISKS in this one.

Canadians will like the 26A clue; 
my grandmother always liked to see Mel.",11,neutral,0.4553509056568146
"I'm always very nervous when I see a puzzle with such beautiful symmetry--my experience is that they can be harder (for me) than less regularly symmetrical ones. This one did not have that problem. It was not hard to get at least parts of the long answers on the top and both sides, and that made it possible to fill in those areas early on. I was afraid the fairly isolated middle would be a problem, but YAMAHAS was a good start (my more-than-50-year-old Yamaha guitar is still a thing of beauty) and then I learned how popular HINDI is. So NO APOLOGIES, I liked this one.",16,positive,0.37367862462997437
"Sorry, Deb, but this is not a new clue for OTT.  It appeared verbatim on July 26, 2015.  The hockey team has also been clued various other ways, last time being on Jan. 13, 2018. 

Cluing him to Master Melvin of the New York Giants, however, has occurred about 400 times, though, especially before the Ottawa Senators was a thing, or three-letter scoreboard abbreviations.

Maybe the word you meant was ""rare"".",1,neutral,0.7904570698738098
"WANNA MAKE A BET this puzzle doesn't garner anywhere near the number of comments that the Thursday puzzle did?

This one was an average builder. Not too many pop culture  proper names, and I'll admit I didn't know KLAY without all the crosses.  SAGAN was an educated guess.  

Good one, Mr. Logan.  Let's have more.",11,negative,0.5750290155410767
