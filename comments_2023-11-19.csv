"On this Thanksgiving week, it touches me personally that one of the constructors today is Rebecca Goldstein and I just can't not say something about it.

And so please allow me the honor of this shout-out to  Rebecca, and to Merck, with my deepest and most heartfelt gratitude that can't be put into words. 
Because of you, Rebecca, and Merck, each and every day is a day of thanks-giving for me; each and every day, an astounding miracle.

Yes, the crossword today was a beautiful work of construction by you and Rachel, and I thank you both for it.

But my greater thanks today goes to the work you do, Rebecca, figuring out the more significant puzzle of beating the odds. Please be assured I am in that class of living proof of its success.

And so here I am, getting to enjoy doing daily crosswords and interacting with this wonderful community, as if it were just another day. 

But it's never just another day. Because of you, Merck, and the work that you do, it's always yet another day.

With all my heart, thank you.

And a very Happy Thanksgiving to all!",18,positive,0.9489192962646484

(1) Like some other solvers, I was slowed down at the end by PH SCALE. I too had PH Strip, which actually measures acidity, whereas the entry might have been better clued as ""Indicator of acidity"".

"A very clever pun-filled, US Thanksgiving-themed Sunday puzzle.  A few comments:

1.  I don‚Äôt agree with the answer given for 120A.  In both auctions and bridge (and in auction bridge, for that matter), one will OPEN the bidding.  You LEAD a card on each round of play.  Had to OPEN with that because, coupled with MAN instead of BOY, that got me stuck forever in figuring out the clue for 112A.

2.  19A reminded me of the hilarious mohel who was hired to perform a BRIS in one of my favourite ‚ÄúSeinfeld‚Äù episodes.  What a cut-up (oops!).  Anyone else care to share one of their favourite episodes?

3. 79A across reminded me of Aaron Sorkin‚Äôs play (never did get to see it performed),‚ÄúThe Farnsworth Invention‚Äù about Philo Farnsworth, the inventor of television, who never received his due.  Interesting reading on the web about Gray and Bell, the former evidently having submitted his patent on the same day as the latter, a few hours earlier but due to a strange series of events, Bell‚Äôs patent was registered first. Maybe it was for the best.  Hard to imagine ‚ÄúGray‚Äù‚Äôs becoming as ubiquitous as ‚ÄúBell‚Äù in the commercial world.  (‚ÄúSouthern Bell‚Äù is my favourite.)",10,positive,0.5134617686271667

She was probably 3 or 4 then but she was an old soul (my first thought tonight before OLD SONG) and, after the big meal (during which she was bribed by nearly everyone present), she repaired to the bedroom to which we had been assigned for what she hoped would be uninterrupted nap.  Lo and behold, things got slightly raucous out in the living room.  There was laughter, there was merriment, there may have been some singing.  Ellie came out from the bedroom, looked around at the group of us like a disapproving school marm, sighed loudly, and returned to the bedroom.  The first of many Thanksgivings for that wonderful dog, including one that involved a purloined pork belly.  She learned to abide us and we, in turn, would have fun telling each other that we better keep it down or we were going to hear from Miss Ellie.   

May it be a good week of thanks for all of us, starting with our old friend Rachel and her partner in gravy, Rebecca.  Thanks for the punny puzzle.",52,positive,0.7915233373641968
"A fun and enjoyable puzzle.
Happy Thanksgiving to everyone!",10,positive,0.985749363899231
"Wish I'd checked the name of this puzzle first, but I had a blast and still guessed some of the punny theme clues quite early on. Lots of words in this one and plenty of new ones for me (ALPO, SEWARD, etc), but I still had plenty enough fun to take my time and enjoy my longest solve of the week!",10,positive,0.9624402523040771
"Such a fun puzzle. Each theme answer became my favorite as I solved it.   Liked seeing the Macy's DAY Parade, as it was called by our family, in the puzzle, too. And I hate to mention this, but does one really want E COLI anywhere near their Thanksgiving feast?

Question for Lewis. Are ALPO and GRAVY TRAIN a puzz pair, or am I doing that wrong?",18,positive,0.951790988445282
"At our usual neighborhood FRIENDSGIVING, participants vie for unusual preparations of the old standards.

Butternut gnocchi, leek and delicata puff pastry, glazed Blue Hubbard slices‚Ä¶
You could say we have
SQUASH AMBITION.

I‚Äôm absent from them this year in order to be with family (yay!!!), so they‚Äôll have to kick the can (absolutely on the list of bylaws) and shepherd the (many) pies (also in the bylaws) without me.",16,neutral,0.6721612811088562
"Solid punny holiday fun!
And we had a head start since we started the holiday menu planning last night....",9,positive,0.9793204069137573
"Good? Good! I really enjoy the Goldstein-Fabi doubles team, and learning from the column that most of the acrosses are Goldstein, and downs, Fabi, is a novel twist on collaboration, it's ALL EVEN. Google apps was a bit of a stretch, I liked it enough, but it seemed a little strained, partly because if apps is short for appetizers, then congruently hors d'oeuvres shoulda been hrs dvrs or something like that (therein lies the dilemma, since hrs dvrs isn't a thing and looks ugly). But reading over what I've written I look like a twit. Alright, I'll own it: I'm a twit! Cool? Cool!

Epee clue is bound to make the Lewis List and I hope I'm not jinxing it, cuz I was thinking of some silver star...and the Napa clue also caught my fancy. Able was I ere I saw Alba. Enya face, boyo!",27,positive,0.9230912923812866
"This is a Sunday crossword 
where I expect every solver 
who does *not* look 
at the puzzle title 
to be able to discern the theme.

A breezy and pleasantly silly offering 
to take us into the holiday week.

My one hiccup was 
UNclOg before UNSTOP.

And no, I did not know 
85 Down as clued, but
this is a crossword, so now
I know but will likely 
not remember ENOCH.

This is the crossword,
not the Business section,
but by the time we 
""Enter a bear market""
it's a bit more than a SAG.

"Wow, new Sunday record for me at 13:30! Things were falling into place so well that I knew I had a chance to break the previous one, which I think was about 15 minutes. Glad to not run into any snags or a mistyped letter. üòÅ",9,positive,0.9800518751144409
"Never having seen ""Nomadland"", I didn't know to raise an objection about RV LOT...if it indeed takes place in an RV park, that's not the same thing.

An RV LOT is where you go to buy an RV, not where you use one to park it on a trip...or a lifestyle.

There are some RV LOTs out there that are as big as campgrounds, and then some.",5,neutral,0.6234899759292603
