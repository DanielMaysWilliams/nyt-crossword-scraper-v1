I already know that Thursdays often feature the rebus gimmick. Would that it were not so.

It's more a feeling of everyone else knows something I don't; yet when I do find out, I don't feel rewarded, I feel annoyed. 
A crossword is a word puzzle that I find entertaining. It's a fun game. I don't wish to play another hidden game at the same time. When I am playing tennis, if you offer me a chance to play chess at the same time, it's not more fun. It's annoying and distracting. 
Now, in my view, some gimmicks such as a clever Sunday idea can be quite fun. The difference is that they offer some kind of logic as to why they exist. Put another way, a joke has to have two meanings, not one. A good Sunday puzzle has three, a third way of combining what is said. 
A rebus like this is just a hassle. There's no clever reason for the gimmick. Violating the rules of crosswords should be done for a purpose.  Why are we spelling ""Diet"" in two ways? I don't know. Why?

In particular, placing two rebus squares in a (dated) proper name (17A) which many solvers likely won't know should be a no-no. Moreover, crossing that name with two other words that require specific knowledge (1D in the clue, 3D in the fill) which, themselves, are crossed with another proper name (20A) and a foreign-language term (1A)... that's a bit of a mess.

Then, again in the SE, one of the rebus squares is in a proper name (51D) which has, as it's immediate neighbor, a foreign language term (50D). Not knowing either of those would leave a sizeable hole in that corner.

How inspired it is to get two EI or IEs into each theme answer!  I wonder if there's a computer program that can help a constructor out with that?  But it doesn't matter if there is: we solvers are the beneficiar[IE]s of that A.I. assistance.  I loved this puzzle and was sorry when it was over.

I had entered all the rebuses with just IE and paused before I finished, wondering if I'd be able to sort out the correct format once I got the 'close but no cigar' message. Was surprised to finish successfully and nice to know that they had decided to take the rebuses either way.

One answer history search today was for... EIEIO. Well - it's been answer 73 times, but... only 3 of those in pre-Shortz puzzles. Puzzled by that.

"Like Jon Michnovicz, I also did 1st grade in Albuquerque, way back in 1980-1981. While I don't recall any concern about our capacity to grok the ""I before E"" rules and its various caveats, the school board seemed very concerned that any of us might flee the state at some point and spread misinformation regarding the spelling of our fair city (Bugs Bunny had the pronunciation covered ... well enough anyway).

Let's face it, is a nutso-looking series of letters. Worse, it doesn't match the spelling of its eponym, Francisco de la Cueva, AKA The Duke of Albu*r*querque. Where'd that ""r"" go anyway? None who made serious inquiries in that vein lived long enough to report back with their findings, so we may never know.

So this is how they learned us: every so often, we'd stand up and intone: AL..... BYOOOO ...... QUARE....... KWEEEE. Over and over again. Kind of screwed up our pronunciation for a while, but once we nailed the spelling, peer pressure and idle threats from adult authority figures set us straight.

And the school board was right to be paranoid. My dad got a job in Maryland two years later and we made east whereupon my lifelong mission began to spread the good word, or spelling as it were, to folks who habitually mispronounced my last name and didn't believe me that New Mexico is a state of the United American variety.

"Fun puzzle - I think the rebus was gettable even without a revealer (and I think having a revealer for something like this would be either impossible or so on the nose that it would ruin things / not be a clever clue)

I try to make it a habit when doing rebus puzzles to always enter them as slashes, putting the across part of the answer before the ""/"" and then the down part of the answer after.

In this case, it really helped me appreciate what a beautiful construction this is - four long across answers which all had both IE and EI in them - and - all crossed with the opposite pairing! Well done!",68,positive,0.8154128789901733

"I caught on to the rebus pretty quickly, but wasted a lot of time deciding whether to place the correct pair of letters for the across answers before the / or after.  Not the first time I have needlessly complicated matters for myself by being persnickety.  I should have known that multiple formats including ones without a / would be acceptable, but a rebus never satisfies me unless it contains all the necessary letters and, if appropriate a /.",23,negative,0.5731282830238342

I got through this one in a little bit better than average time. Figuring out what to enter for the rebus boxes took the most time. This puzzle only served to reiterate my dislike of rebuses.,6,negative,0.461373507976532
"It‚Äôs funny.  I wrote a comment, which I then deleted, to the effect that while I love a particularly apt revealer, I think I prefer no revealer for a puzzle like this.*  More puzzling.  I see Steve L.  feels differently.  Different strokes.  

* I deleted it because I began to think about other stuff, non-crossword stuff, and when my mind drifted back to my comment, I thought: ‚ÄúIs this really consequential enough to even think about - whether a crossword should have a revealer?‚Äù  I was going to skip Wordplay comments altogether because I am so preoccupied  by the non-crossword stuff.  Then I read the first few comments, including Steve‚Äôs, and thought to myself:  ‚ÄúHey, what‚Äôs more consequential than crosswords?!‚Äù  Hence, this comment.",34,neutral,0.6102206110954285
"I rushed through this one and to my chagrin I missed two pairs of across/down rebuses, leaving HieSMANTOPHeiS as an appropriate if not ignominious memento. Is there a way to edit a ""solved"" grid without starting over?",0,negative,0.7909175157546997
"For the first time since I have started the NYT crossword puzzle years ago, I give up on this one.  This one is just ridiculous.  I intelligence to the Rebus.  Just random uses of E and I.  No thanks.",34,negative,0.9054989814758301
"This puzzle kinda needed to have a revealer (or was EDITORS supposed to be one?)...without one, it just seemed pointless.

I got through the puzzle in a normal amount of time, and saw there had to be a rebus right from the start...it had to somehow be VIVIEN LEIGH, which didn't fit.

Soon after, I discovered that the IE's and EI's were the rebus, but the across answers and the down answers each had the other digraph.  

But why?  

Just because they could?  That didn't seem like a satisfying reason.  I was waiting to see what clever gem tied all of this together.

And there was none.  Quite disappointed.
