"This is a callback to the Sunday puzzle that included the word ‚Äúchiasmus‚Äù which was new to many commenters.*

Chiasmus means ‚Äúshaped like the Greek letter ‚Äòchi‚Äô: X‚Äù and that is because one element / is answered by its reversal \ to give an X shape.

When Abraham Lincoln went from Springfield, Illinois, to Washington D.C., for his inauguration, he went by train through a roundabout route that made stops in all the big cities as it went. When he was assassinated, and after lying in state, his body was brought from Washington to his burial in Illinois by the same trains, using the same crews, tracing the same journey backwards. That is a real-life chiasmus and a great example that the device is not limited to clever turns of phrase, but to any construct where the elements are reversed within the larger whole.

Walt Whitman‚Äôs colossal poem written to honor the fallen Lincoln (When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom‚Äôd) recalls that journey and echoes it by being made as a grand scale chiasmus itself, with hundreds of chiasms within it. Paul Hindemith‚Äôs deeply felt musical setting of that text does the same thing musically. The poem and the requiem are challenging, and sobering, but worth visiting for those interested in a deeper understanding of the beauty in chiasmus, beyond the trite and empty reversals like ‚Äúwar is peace, peace is war.‚Äù

My mother who passed away 4 years ago would always do the Sunday crossword on print with an ancient (red) crossword puzzle dictionary nearby. As she aged, she would get upset and frustrated, and eventually stopped doing them altogether. I always loved doing crossword puzzles but thought the Sunday too hard for me although I usually could help her with clues she couldn't get it.  It was her thing and I did not take the thing up until the pandemic, first doing the Sunday puzzle like her, on paper, changing to digital, and now doing the crosswords every day.

"Lovely theme because it‚Äôs so true to life, where there's a constant presence of statements that strain credulity. And thus, ironically, the theme is so believable!   

One statement that I will believe every time, however, is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so excited!  That‚Äôs my name atop a New York Times crossword puzzle!‚Äù  Congratulations on your debut, Benjamin.

Smooth puzzle, in which I kept coming across things in threes:
‚Ä¢ Eye related: LASH, LID, STYE.
‚Ä¢ OO-sounding enders: REVIEW, REGREW, LONG U.
‚Ä¢ Four letter words with double-letters in the middle: ABBA, ESSO, APPS.
‚Ä¢ Theme echoers, that is, things that can be hard to believe: HAIRPIECES, EPIC, SWOON.

I tried to guess the revealer (without reading its clue) before uncovering it and got to the point where I knew it had to do with things that are often hard to believe, but couldn‚Äôt nail it.  So, I began uncovering it one letter at a time from the beginning, and finally got it at CANY.  Small steps.

"What a timely puzzle! At dinner, I was describing a scene in Oliver Sacks' ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"" (1985), where he was passing by a ward where a group of aphasics (people with trouble processing language) were all laughing hilariously at the TV, where Reagan was speaking. As a result of their challenges many aphasics are supersensitive to body language, facial gestures and expressions.

‚ÄúThus it was the grimaces, the histrionisms, the false gestures and, above all, the false tones and cadences of the voice, which rang false for these wordless but immensely sensitive patients. It was to these (for them) most glaring, even grotesque, incongruities and improprieties that my aphasic patients responded, undeceived and undeceivable by words. This is why they laughed at the President‚Äôs speech.‚Äù

""I wonder what they would have made of the latest GOP debate,"" said my wife. ""'Speaking as a man' is never a good way to begin a response on abortion restrictions. And that weird smile pasted on De Santis's mug...""

Sometime later I asserted that, conversely, cruciverbalists are the antithesis of aphasics in their super-sensitivity to meanings, wordplay, sounds, linguistic oddities, etc. ""Case in point,"" I said, ""there was a dispute yesterday over whether 'pearl clutching' could be considered sexist or ageist."" 

""Depends,"" said Leslie, ""but probably.""
