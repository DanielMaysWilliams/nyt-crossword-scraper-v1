"I hope it's okay to share this here because it's not about today's puzzle. As I've mentioned before, I only started doing the crossword in August. And I'm actively trying to be better at it. Part of that is that I have started going through the archives, now that I've been getting a bit better. I had been doing it kind of randomly, like picking a random birthday or some such but then I started a few weeks ago with January 2023. 

Today, I did Thursday, January 18th. The blog column is labeled Accumulate Charges. And it was the first time I completely and all on my own got the trick and worked it all out by myself! All of it!  No lookups, nothing! Not only did I identify there was a trick, I worked it all out! 

I figured it all out!!  Squeal!!! 

I am over the moon!! And it was a little bit under my average. I read the blog and the comments section after, and, as usual with Thursday tricky themes, there was a lot of controversy about it but I enjoyed it very much!! I am just tickled pink!!  Huzzah!!!

Now to see if I can figure out this fine Thursday puzzle! ü§ó",137,positive,0.6647369265556335
