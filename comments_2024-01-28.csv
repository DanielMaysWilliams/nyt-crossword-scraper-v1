"A gentle and playful Sunday ‚Äî just the thing for a foggy, rainy day.

And a clue sparking thoughts of ‚ÄòA Farewell to Arms.‚Äô

I‚Äôve never read a biography of Hemingway, or even serious literary criticism on any of his work. In fact, the last time I had thought about Hemingway was in high school, when I rammed my way through 4 of his novels in the space of a week or so and wrote the usual essays. I had called his prose pithy and had thought it terse; called it unadorned and meant simplistic. I spent the next 30 years calling it my least favorite prose style.

Which was simplistic.

I went back to Hemingway last summer, prompted by something I read. In a space of a week or so, I breathlessly read 4 novels. And then I spent the next week or so just thinking. I marveled at how much could be said without saying much about it at all. I thought about Hobbes and thought that maybe Hemingway had read him‚Äîof course he had read him‚Äîand that he then set out to append an adjective to a declaration of his: that life was ‚Äúnasty, brutish, and short‚Äù‚Äî and also beautiful.

‚ÄúThe world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.‚Äù

"After moving by the acrosses and not getting very far, I decided to let my solve wander and by chance hit the MOLE(CULES) on the first WHAC. That, with the title, made for a smooth solve for the other HOLEs (though I wondered if we were going to see pit, void, and other synonyms as the rebus). I agree with those who say the circles took the edge off the puzzle, but it's Sunday, not Thursday, so I can forgive. The reward graphics were completely delightful. 

I expected moaning at the rebuses, and I was not disappointed. It's fascinating to me that folks call this ""cheating,"" even though the practice (along with many another diverse puzzle style) is accepted, even welcomed by the Crossworld. As in so many other venues, clear (if complex) rules, widely agreed upon, are not negated by one person's deciding he doesn't like them, no matter how loudly he complains.",15,positive,0.5669193267822266

The OZONE HOLE, the environmental problem addressed by the Montreal Protocol, is *not* a climate issue. The ozone layer, a region of the stratosphere, absorbs almost all of the sun‚Äôs ultraviolet radiation ‚Äî thus protecting life on the surface (including us). In the 1970s, scientists discovered that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) ‚Äî manmade chemicals used in refrigeration, cooling, aerosols, and other applications ‚Äî were depleting the ozone layer (atmospheric circulation and polar temperatures means that ozone depletion is concentrated over the poles, leading to a ‚Äúhole‚Äù over the Antarctic where the lowest ozone levels have been recorded). The 1987 Montreal Protocol instituted a phaseout of CFCs (and, subsequently, other ozone-depleting chemicals) that has led to a dramatic reduction in ozone-depleting substances, leading scientists to project that the ozone layer will slowly recover to 1980 levels over the next several decades.

"Rebuses, shaded squares, left/right grid symmetry ‚Äì a grab bag ‚Äì yet nothing out of whac.

Fun to fill in, to discover which rebus was unlike the others, to smile at the play on ‚Äúknuckle‚Äù in the NOOGIE clue and the play on ‚Äúspot‚Äù in the TEATIME clue, to nod with respect at the exemplary misdirect [Make perfect, maybe] for PRACTICE, and to say hello to PLOSIVE and PALPITATE ‚Äì a couple of old friends I haven‚Äôt visited in many an age.

And yet, what I‚Äôm walking away most with comes from Nathan‚Äôs notes, where he reveals he worked on perfecting this puzzle for more than two years, including many iterations.  The persistence, drive for excellence, and patience, not to mention working to bring the best experience possible to the solver ‚Äì I‚Äôm wowing and bowing at that; I find it deeply inspiring.

"I like the idea, although wasn‚Äôt expecting a rebus and that threw me off for a while!

However, I take issue with the clue to 53A. ‚ÄòTiter‚Äô (or to me, titre) is not a measure of solution strength. I would excuse concentration, but strength and concentration are not the same thing in Chemistry. If we consider acids, acid strength tells you how well an acid dissociates into ions in solution. Acid concentration tells you how many moles of acid are dissolved in a given volume of solution. So, they are very different properties. Sorry, as a Chemistry teacher I couldn‚Äôt let this one go!",7,negative,0.5258001089096069

I found the mole, and thought that perhaps there would be others, but WHAC-A-MOLE took care of that. TIL how to spell that correctly!

Once I got that sorted out it still wasn't done. I had GIG cars instead of ZIP, which is the version I was familiar with but seems to be limited to the SF bay area.  Finally, YENT_/A_OU was a natick for me so I just had to run the letters.

My Sunday and Monday strategies are similar: lay down the low-hanging fruit as quickly as possible on the first pass and avoid thinking too much. My success with this varies as it's tempting to check crosses on a long puzzle, but usually I net 40 or more answers about 8-10 minutes, but today I doubt I got half that.

While a rebus in the NYT Crossword *may* involve 
putting two or more letters in one square, 
it may also be what non-crossworders call a rebus,

you linked. There were years of traditional rebuses 
here before the first ""squishes.""
