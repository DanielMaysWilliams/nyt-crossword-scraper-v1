"Whew! Just got back from my ECLIPSE jaunt. There was the most traffic I've ever seen on I-95 north of Old Town; heading there is almost always very little traffic once you are north of the Stillwater Avenue exit in Old Town. Today, it was like Massachusetts traffic. 

When we got to the Medway exit, where one gets off the highway to head west to Millinocket, the exiting traffic was backed up all the way onto the right travel lane for about a half mile. Scoping out the situation, we decided to abort Plan A (Millinocket) and go to Plan B (Milo/Brownville). That meant sitting in that exit line, on the line acrid the overpass, to get to the southbound entrance. Not too bad -- the police were prioritizing getting the backed up cars off the interstate so we lost no more than 10 minutes. 

We got to Milo and found a little museum with rest facilities and extensive grounds where we parked and set up. And bathrooms! 

The down side was that Milo is close to the edge of the zone of totality, so we had only a little more than a minute. Cf. about 3 minutes at Millinocket. But, we decided this was good enough and set up our chairs and pulled out the cooler and snacks and tied the dogs up. 

It was lovely, if short. And what a view of the corona we had! It was stunning. Jupiter and Venus were clearly visible in the dark sky around the sun. 

Overall, it was a great trip north followed by some great Thai food, and then home. 

Highly recommended.",11,neutral,0.44299399852752686
"I do the crossword on my phone, zoomed in so the grid fills the screen width. Happily, this means the revealer on Mondays is almost always ""below the scroll"" out of sight. 

So when I hit the second theme clue this morning and realized there was a musical connection, I started getting excited that Bonnie Tyler might make it in. How cool that her hit was the revealer!! Teenaged G was a *huge* fan -- the drama! That video! Aahhhh!

Even better, my weekday soundtrack is supplied by WFUV, and all the DJs today were picking up on the eclipse theme as well. So many great tunes, here in the puzzle and the column and there on the airwaves -- it was a synchronicity/wavelength moment for sure. 

I spent the afternoon in a graveyard with hundreds of other Brooklynites (the incredible Green Wood Cemetery, who did it up right). As the sliver of sun got smaller, and I repeatedly donned my cardboard glasses, one lyric above all kept screaming in my brain:

Mama always told me not to look into the eyes of the sun
But mama, that's where the fun is...

"Here's WNY we're supposed to have mostly cloudy skies, but as long as they're mid to high elevation - which it appears that they will be - we should still see some really cool effects!

From this article:
""mid-to-high-level clouds — cirrostratus, altostratus and/or cirrocumulus...

But upon the arrival of the moon's shadow, we saw its distinctly sharp edge move in. For those of a certain age who might remember the long-running television soap opera ""The Edge of Night,"" whose opening showed an animation with a line of darkness sweeping over a city, that's exactly what I was reminded of as we were enveloped by the moon's umbral shadow. Once you actually experience it for yourself, it becomes easy to understand why this sight was so terrifying to ancient people. 

Along with the sudden darkness came a change in the clouds' color. Behind the forward-moving edge of the moon's shadow were strange and exotic colors. The dull gray suddenly became yellow-orange and tints you'd see while looking through a beer or iodine bottle. Indeed, along the very edge of the disappearing sun at the start and end of totality, an arc of ruby red or fuchsia associated with the solar chromosphere appeared. It looked bright red because the hydrogen in the sun was emitting a reddish light at high temperatures, and some of this light may become evident in the clouds at the beginning and end of totality.

One wrong guess.  I guessed MOONSHADes and it was instead MOONSHADOW.  But the rest were easy.

Biggest question upfront: Would it be TOTAL ELIPSE or SOLAR ECLIPSE?

I'm guessing that none of these songs have anything whatsoever to do with an ECLIPSE.  Am I right?

So my last question about this quite enjoyable and very timely puzzle is this:  Is it a big ""Planning-in-Advance"" piece of construction: i.e. Peter Gordon knew w-a-a-a-y in advance (which is how the NYTXW works) that the ECLIPSE was coming and planned accordingly?

I took a poll amongst myself and it was unanimous: Peter is remarkable.

I like the serendipitous echoes to today’s Big Event that showed up in the puzzle.  The word that goes with “moon” (NEW), and the word that goes with “sun” (RAYS).

Better yet, the letter O, which echoes the black circle we see in pictures of the total eclipse.

Say you are the sun.
You emit rays, eschew frost.
At dusk, you're seen out.

Really enjoyed this one, which is not always my opinion of Peter Gordon’s work.",4,positive,0.8970235586166382
"Very enjoyable. While doing this, ""Here Comes the Sun"" and ""That's Amore"" rattled around inside of my head.",17,positive,0.9522151350975037
"Add Eclipse by Pink Floyd to the song list.  Most people think it, with Brain Damage, is a song named Dark Side of the Moon.",13,neutral,0.8127582669258118
"If you've never watched the literal version of Bonnie Tyler's Total Eclipse of the Heart video, please treat yourself right now!

You're welcome! 

Oh and a very fun puzzle too!! 😊",12,positive,0.8827522397041321
"To take up Sam’s invitation, how about the Beatles’ “Here Comes the Sun”?  (OK, so you have to wait till the tail end of the event.)   But at least you have to admit that it’s more appropriate than ZZ TOP’s “Cheap Sunglasses”. 

I would have liked a few more topical clues, such as “The right cigar to smoke (or the right rum to drink) for this occasion”.

????????

!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"How great to have an eclipse themed puzzle, and even better that it is based on a musical playlist. My favorite is MOONSHADOW. 

My favorite eclipse fact is the weird numerical coincidence that the Sun is approximately 400 times larger than the Moon but also 400 times more distant from the Earth. So, even though the Moon is much smaller than the Sun, it is just close enough to Earth to appear the same size as the Sun when seen from Earth. How cool is that!

To those in the path, enjoy the show.",46,positive,0.9865759015083313
What a cute puzzle! Loved the music references.,6,positive,0.9793830513954163
"I'm not good with music, but Downs were easy enough and the theme made the word combinations clear. Fun puzzle, 5:30, think that's my best for a Monday or close to it",2,positive,0.8832745552062988
"Quick and certainly on topic. I took a minute longer because I put solar instead of TOTALECLIPSE and then I had to adjust everything around it.

Never heard of the songs mentioned but their titles certainly seem appropriate as a soundtrack for the big event! 

I loved the retort AMI. I’ve been told I have a habit of answering a question with a question so I snorted at that clue 😜.

Exciting day ahead!",18,positive,0.5786893963813782
"Love the musical tribute to the eclipse in today’s puzzle. For me, this is the song that is emblematic of the eclipse:

“I guess we will be making history when we all join hands just to watch the sky… for a moment”

Remember your solar glasses!! Keep your eyes safe.
