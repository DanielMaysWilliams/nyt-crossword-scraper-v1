"For those who got the Sunday Magazine but who are not planning to try the Diagramless since they're sure they can't do it:  Today may be your day.

In a Diagramless, ""regular crossword symmetry"", which is what you get most of the time, is not your friend.  ""Right-Left"" symmetry IS your friend; it makes it much easier to avoid big gaps in your grid and have building blocks you can trust and build on from top to bottom.

"Still a NOOB here at puzzle 127 for me!  Always one to love a good (or bad) pun, I had a lot of chuckles in this one.  The only bummer for me was finishing on 20A - OBESE. It was fine but after so many lovely clues and answers, that had to be my least favorite. That's probably why it was the last one I got, I suppose. I just couldn't come up with it for the longest time. 

Things I'm proud of today:
-Gold star - without having to correct anything! Huzzah!! It's new for me to be able to correct myself as I go through. Ex: SPIkEy versus SPINED.
-Beat my (very slow but improving) average.
-Only one lookup (84D - RORY. I had no clue who that was and was struggling with SOPOR (new word for me) and CRANNY, which was surely stowed away in some nook in my brain.
-Remembered CABAL from a recent puzzle and got that pretty quickly!
-Instantly remembered 85A - ANIMA - from an ancient psych class, which I was moderately obsessed with for a while when I was much Junger.

"Would have gotten the gold star except for two crosses that seemed *extremely* obscure to me; SPINEy made the most sense for 102D (once I finally got away from RuM for 113A) but EyITED looked like a misspelling of EVITED. When Y turned out to be incorrect too, I had to run through the alphabet. The real obscurity: I had ClANNY for 104A, and since I didn't get 98D at all that left me clueless as to what it could be. I would have run the alphabet there too if not for R being the first letter I tried; couldn't get away from ""niche"" as an adjective, not a noun. This on the heels of a number of semi-blind guesses down the stretch, especially in the south (though since I had aAH for 52D, the 50A/51D cross almost required running through the alphabet as well); not being a gamer 109D was sort of an ""I guess?"" for me, and with 126A I pretty much had to guess what D_N_E_Y was, since I didn't know what 121D and 123D were getting at either.",3,neutral,0.538323163986206

My other brother and my sister were nice, chubby kids, so she would always point to them, and say ‘See, see, I feed all of them’. She loved them for it  because they were her saving grace. I remember going swimming and my cousin sticking a finger at my ribs, saying I see your skeleton. 
Anyway, we are all grown now, our weights are fine, and I’d quite forgotten about this until reading the comments about Jabba. If being on the hefty side is considered appropriate and even attractive in Hutt, where Jabba is from, then calling him obese may not be pejorative at all.

"While I enjoyed the punning overall, I found the clue for 105A a bit weak.  What do a carpenter’s skills have to do with a CABINET POSITION? Isn’t that all about furniture layout in a room?

Speaking of CABINETS, I am reminded of a bit of hilarious pun humour that arose from the infamous “Profumo Affair”, a scandal that rocked the British government led by Harold Macmillan in the early 1960s.  John Profumo was the Secretary of State for War in Macmillan’s CABINET.  He had been having an extra-marital affair with a 19-year-old model, Christine Keeler.  Although he denied the affair before the House of Commons, a police investigation soon determined that he had lied. (It wasn’t just the affair itself that was so unsettling, but the story that Christine Keeler may have been having an affair at the same time with a Soviet naval attaché, raising the spectre of a risk to national security.)  The scandal led shortly afterwards to Macmillan’s resignation — stated to be for health reasons — and to the Conservatives’ losing the general election the following year.

In order not to offend sensitive eyes/ears, I won’t repeat the CABINET pun that arose soon after news of the Profumo Affair broke.  I will simply remind those of you who are of my vintage about it and assume you all remember it well.",7,neutral,0.5392059683799744
"John Cage,an experimental composer, sat on his piano seat for 4′33″ in 1952. 

Instead of any ole gong or oboe solo, there was silence. Cage said  4′33″ was, in his opinion, his most important work.

Perhaps, amongst the hazards of lame duck bills and hot button issues, our elected hens might practice a little silence -  talk less and avert another iffy cabal along party lines.

Plato would applaud THAT republic, but it would take an act of congress!

Thanks, Zachary David Levy and Jeff Chen for a fun solve. Congratulations JC on 150 grids! Miss you at xwordinfo.",14,neutral,0.5693594813346863

"Legislatively speaking, this was monumental.  Just enough in the way of checks and balances to make it a bit tough, but not a fill(a)buster.

Thanks, Messrs. Levy and Chen.  If this puzzle is representative of your construction skills, I would elect to see you again soon.

   ""...it’s a goofy and inane puzzle...""
I agree.

Hi Jeff: If you had not co-constructed, 
would you have given this one a ""POW!""?

"Just to add to @CLM’s description of Sid Sivakumar’s 5/14 puzzle in Tito’s Sunday Puzzle of the Year thread:

Titled “Alternate Endings” with ZIPPER MERGES revealer. Two vertical entries “merged” into a third vertical entry, which completed the two above through alternating letters.

Ex:  “Person with a stopwatch” (TIMEKE) and “Meat -and-vegetables dish with Creole and Cajun varieties” (JAMBA) “merged” into “Many a presidential election occurs in one (LEAPYEAR).  LEAPYEAR’s EPER completed TIMEKEEPER while its LAYA completed JAMBALAYA.
