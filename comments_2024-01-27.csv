So much great wordplay!! Far and away my favorite is ""Way down below"" - helped in part by the H in SHADE, one of the first answers I got and definitely one of those ""no way this is right"" moments. Also enjoyed the echoed 7D and 39D.

Well... 16 letters, so it's never been in a puzzle, but 'distress' was in the clue for DAMSEL (and DAMSELS) several times.

I'm done. Looking forward to more from the Warringtons.

"Smooth sailing until I reached the bottom corners.  Probably needed more sleep but soldiered through.  Knew DAMSEL flies but that clue really bugged me.  Not remembering ELON SERTainly held things up on the other side.  

A charming debut and hope to see more from this dynamic duo!

I hope Mr. Kite will benefit from that HOGSHEAD of wine.",9,positive,0.44987207651138306
"For me, a great example of doing better after a good night‚Äôs sleep!  And when I woke, it still seemed hard and then, one by one‚Ä¶.",7,positive,0.7996195554733276
"Having hired one of our best workers based nearly entirely on admiring the tattooed visage of John Steinbeck on their shoulder, I am now also perfectly willing to vote for Grace Warrington as President of the United States 18 years from now (when she's 35 or so) because of the staggered triple stack in this puzzle in which she has expressed justifiable pride. Someone so good at stacking can probably do the same for the Supreme Court after all!

A double albatross for me means two versions of Baudelaire's ""L'Albatros"" (1841) from Fleurs du Mal:

Often, for pastime, mariners will ensnare
The albatross, that vast sea-bird who sweeps
On high companionable pinion where
Their vessel glides upon the bitter deeps.

Torn from his native space, this captive king
Flounders upon the deck in stricken pride,
And pitiably lets his great white wing
Drag like a heavy paddle at his side.

This rider of winds, how awkward he is, and weak!
How droll he seems, who lately was all grace!
A sailor pokes a pipestem into his beak;
Another, hobbling, mocks his trammeled pace.

The Poet is like this monarch of the clouds,
Familiar of storms, of stars, and of all high things;
Exiled on earth amidst its hooting crowds,
He cannot walk, borne down by his giant wings.

-- Richard Wilbur trans.

"Just read all 44 comments posted so far.
I solved the puzzle, but I do not get the commenters references to Spinal Tap or the band Rush. Oh well, a solve is a solve.",0,neutral,0.6261795163154602
"Quick but nice.  MANHOLE brought back memories of sticking a rake handle in the notch and sliding the cover aside to retrieve a Pensie Pinky that rolled down the sewer during a stickball game.  We became much more careful after my brother nearly lost his big toe.  

CONFIDANT is such a great word and Secret lover? was an excellent clue.  I was surprised to see that the word was a debut in the Shortz ERA.",10,positive,0.745760977268219
Very impressed by this father and daughter team and certainly look forward to more.  Maybe a fun theme next time.,9,positive,0.9899439811706543
"This crossword was not as seamless for me as Friday's puzzle was, which means I had to resort to Google.... a lot. Even with help I solved over my Sat average. 

I just wasn't on the right wavelength, the clues threw me for a loop. Or maybe I've been hit on the noggin too many times.",7,negative,0.8541139960289001
"Would loved to have solved your 23A clue and glad you referenced it in your comment. Any HS soph who loves ""Spinal Tap"" has got a wicked (and I'm sure delightful) sense of humour. Good going Dad & Dot!",8,positive,0.9704229831695557
"One of those Saturdays where intuition must come to the rescue of ignorance.

Atop the list of things in this puzzle I don't know is .... how I ever finished it!  But the 'don't' is now 'didn't' -- which is why we solve in the first place.",9,negative,0.5958258509635925
I had to get to ‚ÄúANDY‚Äù through cross-answers. I was unaware that ‚ÄúDY‚Äù is Spanish for ‚ÄúAN‚Äù‚Ä¶and the little bit of Googling I did was unable to confirm it for me.,4,neutral,0.6488648653030396
Nice puzzle and I think the constructors really rocked it with their original clue for 23A.,21,positive,0.9772910475730896
"I had HOPoN x BoNET down there in that tricky little south east quadrant. 

A very nice puzzle with a crosser or two that definitely added tens of minutes to my solve. 

But it wouldn‚Äôt be a Saturday unless we all spent a little time in Natick! Gotta love a good Saturday.",13,positive,0.8775179386138916
"TIL that there are at least 14 different sizes of wine barrels, and that a HOGSHEAD is one of the three most common, somewhere in the middle size-wise. I have a much greater appreciation for the naming of the Hog‚Äôs Head in the Harry Potter books. 

I also learned that the world‚Äôs largest wine barrel is  considered to be the Heidelberg Tun, holding 220k liters and built with a dance floor on top of it!

"Sam's explanation of an albatross and a condor is not quite correct. They are not the same. An albatross is three under par, so on a PAR FIVE, it is not a hole-in-one but rather it is two strokes. A hole-in-one on a par four is an albatross.
A condor is 4 under par, so it is a hole-in-one on a PAR FIVE- (or two strokes on a par six).
In my golfing days, I never needed to know those terms. I mostly recorded bogey, double bogey( buzzard) and even double par quite often.",8,neutral,0.758374035358429
"I solved this one in fairly good order, except for trying firstborn before settling on ELDESTSON.  I held on to my mistake a little too long because the terminal N fit nicely with MANDALORIAN.  I enjoyed seeing the word HOGSHEAD crop up. I‚Äôm not sure why.  It‚Äôs just a word that tickles my fancy.",13,positive,0.8093910217285156
"This was a lively puzzle and fun to work.  I nearly TOOK LEAVE of my senses, with so many slightly off-kilter clues‚Äîwarnings to PLAY IT SAFE and not be over CONFIDeNT or I'd wind up a DAMSEL in distress. (Consider the PAR FIVE MAN HOLE.)

Thanks for the fun, Warringtons. You made my Friday Saturday.",18,positive,0.8009900450706482
"Loved your original idea for 23A - I wish it had survived.  

No idea what a BOSS BATTLE is but I can see how it can be the highlight of a video game.  I should have got the English word + Spanish equivalent = Boy's name but I was looking for a 2 + 2 and I  was still wondering until a few seconds ago why (Spanish) DY should be the same as (English) AN.  D'oh! (or is it DUH? - someone here will correct me).",29,positive,0.8784211874008179
"Seems like Mando would fit in nicely at The Hog‚Äôs Head‚Ä¶ 

NBA‚Ä¶has that been clued like that before? Loved it! And HOPIN‚Ä¶great misdirects in this one.

A few minutes off a personal best ‚Äî I was expecting a bit of a tougher road for a Saturday but I really enjoyed this puzzle through and through.

Thanks so much!",9,positive,0.959459125995636
"Well, this was slightly harder than Friday. That's something, I guess.

In addition to Rush, the puzzle has echoes of Taylor Swift with ERAS and SHADE.

And while Grace highlights the staggered triple stack, my eyes turned to the entries down the middle: you have AMASS and HOARD (do plutocrats COO?), and the image of triumphing in a BOSS BATTLE GLORIOUSLY.

Great to see you in the late week, Sam.",16,neutral,0.7163367867469788
"The southeast sector really threw me off, but generally had a great time with the rest.

ABASE, ASCETIC, BOSSBATTLE?  Don‚Äôt see those every day!",17,positive,0.44800975918769836
I had lots of fun with this puzzle and finished in near PR time. Congrats to the constructors on a very fun and clever Saturday!,8,positive,0.9902616143226624
"‚ÄúDouble albatross, eh? That must be when you take way too many shots. Probably, like, say, 15 shots on a PAR NINE hole.‚Äù

I submit my thinking so that you golf people can have a good laugh. Now I see that ‚Äúalbatross‚Äù means the opposite of what it sounds like it should, and there‚Äôs no such thing as par nine. 

Enjoyed the puzzle, GW&GW, and the extra laugh from my golf goof.",18,neutral,0.5084547400474548
"UGH, please tell me what is going on with the sudoku puzzles??! Why aren‚Äôt they released along with the crossword anymore and when can we reasonably expect them to be live? Today‚Äôs puzzles STILL weren‚Äôt up when I woke up this morning.",2,negative,0.908453643321991
"Congratulations on a fun NYT debut, Ms Warrington and Mr. Warrington! I enjoyed pulling out little bits of stuff that I have learned from crosswords like BOSS GAME and ERAS.

"Took a punt on MANDALORIAN, I have never seen it. ‚ÄúIce planet Pagodon‚Äù just sounded so Starwarsy. Gave me a real foothold for a near fastest solve, helped by gimmes SAGAL and BINET.",7,positive,0.39435797929763794
"I loved this puzzle and absolutely will not complain about it being ‚Äútoo easy.‚Äù  At a certain point, who cares?  I‚Äôll take x minutes of sheer fun, which I thought this was.  Sure, I love that Saturday feeling of being up against it, of feeling like I might be a lot less good at this Xword thing than I thought I was before I started it, of pushing my brain to its upper limits.  But I also love puzzles with personality and this had plenty of it.  All of the ‚Äú?‚Äù clues were keepers and the ANDY clue was brilliant.  

Of course, I‚Äôm blown away that a high school sophomore was the primary constructor.  Yowsa!",69,positive,0.9278088212013245
"TIL about BOSS BATTLE--something completely out of my wheelhouse. And I was happy to suss out MANDALORIAN with a few of the cross words. Nice job, Grace and Greg!",27,positive,0.9561750888824463
