I figured it might be there b/c I'd guessed TONoME and KNoX b/c I just didn't know either way. 

I hope no one forces me to choose a favorite of the theme answers but once I figured out HEAT THE BEATS (after trying bEAT THE BEETS, which had me chuckling but didn't make sense), I enjoyed filling out the others fairly smoothly. 

A small victory: it took a while but I remembered HI HAT at 11D from earlier puzzles. Huzzah!!! Maybe one day it'll come quickly but I struggled with that little section mightily. I didn't know the NJ city, never heard of eboys or goth girls, wasn't sure if it was ESO or ESe, and had a hard time not thinking of struck out as either baseball or got turned down. But I persisted and earned my gold star! 

I was also pleased to remember YALIE from a previous puzzle!  And I really enjoyed a lot of the non-themed longer answers too. NEATO, indeed! 

Btw, checkers is banned in our household because my darling husband and I cannot agree on the rules (i.e., he cheats!) He grew up with Honduran rules, and I with (the proper) U.S. Midwest rules. We otherwise get along swimmingly!  üòä",12,positive,0.6915422677993774
"This puzzle was a shear delight, I loved the witticisms.  I admit to six cheats, but for me on a Sunday, that's a reasonable amount.  I can't say I'll remember the 'sound unit' for next time, or the police captain on a show I never watched, for example, but I didn't mind looking them up.  I hope to see many more puzzles from Spencer Leach!",7,positive,0.9539925456047058

At first I had Lego for 74D but was delighted to change it to KNEX. I still have mine from when I was young and love taking them out to build with my kids whenever we visit my parents‚Äô house.,23,positive,0.9472423791885376
"What a great debut.
I caught on early to the trick but the rest of it was a struggle.

"When I got to SCREWS THE TITANS I recalled TIGHTY RIGHTY from days of yore (five or six days of yore ago) and gave this puzzle a swipe right, hoo boy!

It was a rich jumble of a puzzle, at times with easy fill and other times bumptious and ornery, a whitewater feel and with a few bruises awaiting the solver, not your elegant kayaking on Lake George.  

Ah, the Python program. It reminds me of when digital cameras replaced film cameras; my professional photographer friends all disdained the new cameras and the lack of darkroom hands-on work involved, just as audiophiles upheld analog records in the face of CDs, etc. Sooner or later most of them come around to the Dark Side. But the argument still goes on, and will for generations. I assume it makes the fill easier but who can replace humans for the cluing? I'm sure no-one wants google's Gemini to try its hand. I mean, gah! So we can say the cluing is where the creativity lies these days.

Of course, Python offers a range of options and I imagine that the better the constructor the more there is a give-and-take in the choices of words, which is why I feel fine in applauding Pissarro, Cat Burglar, Eat The Rich, even the horrible Thneedville: the constructor put them there, not some program, and I'm a fan! It's pretty organic, or more accurately, 80% cotton, 20% rayon.

YEET was new to me.  As was KNEX.  Got lucky to correctly cross TONEME with KNEX at the first try.,3,neutral,0.48650944232940674
"I got it from the crossings, so it wasn‚Äôt a problem, but ‚ÄúThneedville‚Äù does not appear anywhere in the original Dr. Seuss version of The Lorax. I know this because I read the book on repeat to my toddler recently. For those familiar with the book, the thought that the land of Truffula Trees and Brown Barbaloots would be called ‚ÄúThneedville‚Äù (presumable after the dirty Onceler‚Äôs destructive product of commerce) is offensive!",41,neutral,0.6864438056945801
