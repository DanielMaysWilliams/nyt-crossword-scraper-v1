Not knowing the four H thingie did not help when the H was the only letter missing there for me - but HAH made most sense for HA_ so I dealt with it. 

I also had to look up pig out and I thought I had to google Rathskeller, because I was convinced it was one of the zillion American brands I have never heard of. And then it turned out it was an alternate spelling of the German Ratskeller.

"So much fun to work this puzzle!  I was wowed each time a theme fill unfolded, intricately constructed with clues that were delightful to figure out.  FOUR H LEADERS was my favorite, until I looked back and saw ONE EYED JACKS, DOUBLE AGENTS, and THREE WISE MEN.  I mean, really, how to choose?  And almost as good were the other fills.  No fat on this one.  How'd he do that?

Brad Wiegmann, you are a wizard of a constructor and I'm so looking forward to seeing your next one.",33,positive,0.9820398688316345
"Sam, a papaw is also known as a paw paw, a fruit that is very unlike the papaya. They grow here and are even more plentiful in western Maryland, but southern Ontario is also known for its paw paws, so next time you go ice fishing, you can try them out (and they're good bait for the pawpoises too!). I don't know if they make paw paw wine, but I'll ask around. Just in case you want to go into the paw paw ice wine business. Around here we sometimes play softball with them, but they don't usually last more than half an inning, if that. We need to find a better fruit.

OK, back to reality. A fine puzzle, I came, I enjoyed, I solved. Not a perfect puzzle -- Double A Gents was brilliant but Three Wise Men would have improved if Mr. Wiegmann had indeed inserted Fyodor Doestoevsky; with only 2 wise men it just doesn't click right -- but I enjoyed learning the origins of jerky and pez, and there was a pluckiness to its spirit that I responded to with hearty good cheer. 

Speaking of which, Mr. Wiegmann, you should crank up some Miley Cyrus (she was so awesome at the VMAs!), grab a few brewskis -- what a word! and echoing Bruce up above -- and sit down with The Brothers Karamazov. Oh man, there's so much achey breaky hearts in that book it would cause even Billy Ray to slowly remove his hat, bow down, and sweep the hat along ground, in obeisance and servitude to his master, the king of jerky twerky heartbreaking Fyodor you know whooski...

"Playfully tricky and fun puzzle, thanks Brad! I love Wednesdays because they're usually gritty enough to get me stuck in a few spots, but surmountable enough to give a great swell of satisfaction when I get unstuck. And this one was a perfect example of that for me. Cheers!",15,positive,0.9767133593559265
"Any puzzle with LEMON BARs is okay by me.
Enjoyed the theme entries, too.

No need to go to the tropics for papaws.  You can find them is southern Maryland (and they are tasty...),13,positive,0.7480459213256836

"Well, the first thing I noticed was:

ONE-EYED JACKS
DOUBLE AGENTS
THREE WISE MEN
FOUR-H LEADERS

As they sing on Sesame Street, one of these things is not like the other...one of these things doesn't belong...
