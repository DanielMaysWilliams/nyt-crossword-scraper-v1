"I'm a younger millennial (30) but after guessing PANGS, PADIDDLE was an easy fill for me. Surprised to see how many commenters had trouble with that word! After the last few Saturdays felt like impossible slogs, this one was much more solvable yet still a good challenge for me. I did Google YOGINI to confirm it was even a word and had to look up types of felt hats to find DERBY, but otherwise lots of patience got me to the end today.

TBH, I wasn't sure when the mascot came into being and read up about it. Imagine my surprise that another answer in today's puzzle popped up in the backstory! Apparently when the student body was polled for mascot ideas, some students voted to be represented by a CIGarette(!). (Probably my favorite clue today was ""Butt to bum"".)

A NARWHAL as a school mascot, you scoff? In this household, it's par for the course! My undergrad is represented by a thoroughbred, because yes, Skidmore College is proudly located in Saratoga Springs, with its vaunted racecourse. And my partner's alma mater has the best mascot of all, the Drexel unicorn! It literally tops lists of these kinds, haha.

And with that, I've come full circle back to that monoceros!

"I find it ironic that the biggest gateway to the northwest corner was 32A, EASYMAN, because I found that portion of the grid to be  by far the most challenging. 

I eventually settled on 1A, Evidence of hunger, PANGS, although I entertained GROWL, GAUNT, and, in an act of desperation, MEWLS. I thought that 5D, D.L., represented a driver's license, so I had STATE there, which meshed with 14A, Benefit, ASSET. And, of course, I'd settled on 17A, Felt hat, BERET. I was also inordinately proud of 25A, Fit for a queen?, SNUG. In short, I'd made just about *every* possible mistake that could be made in that corner. 

But then, just when all looked bleak, I killed off the BERET, which allowed 4D, Taunt, GIBE, to replace my earlier choice of GEER, inspired by the meme, ""I don't often spell JEER, but when I do, I do it wrong üòÄ"".

For one thing, I had FLIT for 6A (a better answer, IMO).

We criss-crossed the continental United States twice (before interstate highways were a thing, so Route 66...and then a more 'northerly' path so as to visit Dad's Coast Guard buddy...)  and you can bet there were games....just nothing named PADIDDLE.  

JORTS?  Can that be correct?  (No one has ever accused me of being 'fashionable' or 'fashion-conscious.')

"PADIDDLE???!!! What on earth?  But I would have considered myself lucky if that had been my only problem in the NW.

Only at the very end did I think of GIBE instead of GOAD and only then could I finish the puzzle.  Oh, it's AVAIL!  Oh, it's DERBY!  Neither of them hard.

So many traps -- and I fell into all of them. Still, I maintain that all my kealoa answers were better than the puzzle's.  GASP is better than GAPE for the ""expression of shock"", but GAPE it was.  GEL is better than GOO for ""Mousse"", but GOO it was. 

And why did I even bother to study Latin if I now confuse BENE with BONA?  BENE left me with -ALLeN for ""tap"" and I knew the answer couldn't be FALLEN.  Finally I figured out CALL ON and that gave me NCAA.  It also enabled me to change cREPe to AREPA -- a street food I don't know at all.  Am I living in the wrong city or just the wrong neighborhood?

It would have been faster except I was stuck on alphabet for 1D. (I had heard of PADIDDLE as a word used in some families to denote a car with one headlight out, but never as a game). I also started with tiNA, but LOLCAT corrected that one pretty quickly.

Sometimes we would see who could find all the letters in the alphabet in order from road signs or billboards. Qs and Xs often proved problematic.  We also played the animal game.  Two players or two teams took a side of the car and got points for animals seen on their side of the car (birds and insects didn‚Äôt count): 2 points for a live animal, 1 point for an animal picture. If you passed a cemetery on your side you lost your points.

"A hard Saturday for me. I've never heard of PADIDDLE and had to get it entirely from crosses, which took forever because I had growl instead of PANGS and beret instead of DERBY for the longest time.

I'm curious about PADIDDLE. We took plenty of road trips when I was a kid in the 50s and 60s, but I only remember I Spy, supplemented by Bingo which used little reusable cards with things like cow on them. There was also the one where you punched your sibling if you saw a VW bug and the requirement to raise your feet off the floor when crossing a railroad track.

""cis,"" which means either the note C-sharp (then it's pronounced [ ¶Ãë ≤is]) or a yew tree ([ ®Ãëis]) and

""zamarzaƒá:"" to freeze [z√£Ààmarza ®Ãë] or to starve (somebody) [z√£Ààma ía ®Ãë]  - in this latter meaning the word is antiquated and its use extremely rare: I've never heard or seen it used anywhere in the 4+ decades of my life.",12,neutral,0.8227865099906921

"On Saturdays, I find it's best not to try to go in order, but rather to pick a section that has a few footholds, and build from there, and to work off those crosses until a corner or entire area is filled in completely, and then move to an adjacent area until there doesn't seem to be any spot where further progress can be made.  Then, you start the same process in another section until the two sections meet, or until you can't go any farther.  Then you repeat the process.

Of course, this works best if you are proficient enough to at least get somewhere each time you start an area.  But it's a good strategy, regardless of how proficient you are.

The advantage of this is that if you try to go in strict order, you're more likely to enter guesses that aren't right, and are hard to let go of...or to figure out what to let go of in the first place.  If you start with a cross of two entries with at least a 90% probability of being right, you're not likely to mess up that section.
