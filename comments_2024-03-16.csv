Didn't immediately get happy music because I don't know my POMs from my wOMs, I guess. I do not know that toy and I put wASTE for wollops... as in, you waste someone by giving them a beating. I had no idea what else it could be and have heretofore been unfamiliar with PASTE in such context.

"I got BRIOCHE BUN from just a couple crosses, as brioche buns are so trendy as to be a clich√©.

Never considered brie cheese, but now that you mention it, sure sounds yummy! Along with some sauteed shiitakes, and a tuft of arugula.

Got the wordplay of [Dog park?] right away; but reading the comments--Hi, Andrzej!--made me wonder the age of the slang: OED's first citation from 1916, but being slang, was probably used orally long before. Originally American, but by 1924 was appearing in the printed work of J. P. Wodehouse.",4,positive,0.8062889575958252

I had to get P in POM/PASTE from the comments because I would have never thought of a POM as a toy or PASTE as a wallop.  I thought maybe tOM was a cat toy and tASTE was like getting a taste of your own medicine kind of wallop. A stretch but just as likely as the P versions. (I do know why the P works now)

FOOTREST cracked me up.  Love EYETESTS. Shocked I remembered TOR. I pulled ASTER out of the random facts section of my brain. ASKEW was fun.

"I've been thinking about BRIe CHEese and how so many people thought that was the answer where BRIOCHE BUN went, and I wondered why that was.  For one thing, I've seen and been served, and even have served others burgers on BRIOCHE BUNS, but I've never given much thought to putting brie on a burger.

For one thing, I don't see it as a particularly good choice for a burger cheese.  Sure, it melts well, but I don't think the flavor pairs well with beef.  Still, if you Google ""brie cheeseburger"", you do find a lot of recipes for it, and even a few restaurants that serve one.

So I guess it comes down to this: just as some cheeses don't pair well with meat, some words don't pair well with each other.  We say ""Swiss cheese"", ""cheddar cheese"", ""American cheese"", but you're not as likely to say ""Brie cheese"".  You'd more commonly just say ""Brie.""  (As in ""baked Brie"".)  Much like you might say ""tuna fish"" or ""codfish"", but not ""salmon fish"" or ""mackerel fish"".

"Not being American complicated things yet again for me in what otherwise was a fun Saturday puzzle with witty clueing.

I had ""atlas"" for geography classroom staple - it worked with CAGE, which in turn meant it could not be a globe (my first intuitive association). As I kept solving it became increasingly obvious atlas was wrong though. However, I just could not come up with US MAP on my own, which is slightly disturbing. I mean, all my geography classrooms had a map of Poland on the wall, so I should have been able to extrapolate US MAP out of that...

KOA does not ring a bell, and misreading the clue (""... In campaigns"") meant I had PAC there for a long time.

I did not understand the clue ""Flag carrier of Panama"" (am I being asked for the Spanish word for flag pole, I thought), and I've never heard of COPA airlines.

PLATELET looks like random letters to me, and I have never hear of OLUO, so the SE corner of the puzzle required two lookups.

TAOS was new to me, too. I have heard of hundreds of American towns and cities, and I visited dozens myself, but the name TAOS I have either never encountered or I forgot I had.

Polish, and European sinks in general, don't have trash disposal - we collect our food waste to be composted or used for energy production, so I was very late to come up with DISPOSAL.

"‚ÄúMediocre: The Dangerous Legacy of White Male America.‚Äù

And this is why in November 2024, liberals will be wondering why we got Trump again. When this stuff is mainstream enough to be a crossword clue when a similar title for any other demographic group would be branded as hate speech (yes yes it‚Äôs different for white men), you can only hope that most white men will take part in the self-abasement for a very limited amount of time before they say ‚Äúforget this‚Äù and join the side that‚Äôs not intent on casting them as a perpetual villain.

The hardest thing was giving up 'bae' on 38A. Its also hard for me (being an old guy) to think of Shel Silverstein as a kid's author.,16,negative,0.7738094329833984
"Such a euphonious strophelicious puzzle, a joy to solve -- for me I started with the ever-hangdog Nicholas Cage and worked my way outward in a spiral. Took the lead --> ERASED was a total winner as was Small bit of mint --> DIME; those two alone were worth the price of admission! 

And yes the musicality: 

anger solder geiger aster
mochas copa coa
shel amble amoral disposal
eco boo pronto oluo

Speaking of Shel, if you only saw the back cover of this book: --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shel_Silverstein#/media/File:Portrait_of_Shel_Silverstein_in_c._1964_by_Jerry_Yulsman.jpg

would you suspect it was ""The Giving Tree"" -- one of the most singsong soulful of children's books? I would have thought it might be a book of revolutionary raging poetry, a cross between Amiri Baraka and Gil Scott-Heron. Well even an old pirate like Shel Silverstein (Ar, matey!) can have a soft side. Speaking of which, the pomeranian in that picture kinda gives me the creeps!

I skipped yesterday but noticed as has everyone that this one is edited by Joel Fagliano, too. Has there been further word on Mr. Shortz's recovery? I know that Mr. Fagliano is doing a fine job, but not seeing the Shortz name editing the puzzle is rattling me, I gotta tell you and it didn't help any to be beset with platelets, doses, shooting your shot, if you haven't ran low. I'm not puzz-shaming, this puzzle is a delight! - just worrying my pretty little head. Will, get well!",24,positive,0.9391049742698669
"No, you're not dreaming, Ms. Schuna -- you really did create a Saturday-worthy puzzle. Thank you!

I started out thinking 
""ohhh-kay, Joel is not kidding around here,"" but it turned out to be easier than yesterday's grid.

My one embarrassing moment was putting in COcA instead of COPA, with ""flag carrier"" going right over my head, and my brain somehow registering ""crop"" -- in which case, think about it, Panama does share a border with Colombia... 
Luckily SPONGE set it all aright.

And, yes, I did Google ASKEW!
Curiosity might have killed the cat, but had me laughing out loud. 

Bravo, Ms. Schuna for this delicious and charming puzzle, with just enough crunch to make me feel victorious on completion.",14,positive,0.9363320469856262

"Great puzzle and I enjoyed the circus video. 

A lot of my initial wrong answers made for a challenging puzzle.
My artisanal hamburger option was BRIE on a BUN. 
I wanted the power-saving mode (33A) to be OFF, but then that didn't fit with BRIEonaBUN.
My first answer for 23A was MEC, but that's too Canadian so I changed it to REI. And then finally remembered KOA.",8,positive,0.5199866890907288

I especially liked seeing BEDHEAD in the grid ‚Äî it‚Äôs a perennial problem for me, as well as the title of a very funny short film by Robert Rodriguez, the guy behind the ‚ÄúSpy Kids‚Äù movies. It‚Äôs been over 40 years since I saw it, but I remember it clearly.

"Here's the entry for the *interjection* ""ar"" in the Oxford English Dictionary, with historical examples:

Used to express a range of emotions or responses, esp. affirmations, assent, or agreement. Frequently in representations of *rural* speech  [emphasis added].

The buyer says: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a fine pig you have there, Mr. ‚Äî‚Äú (giving seller‚Äôs name). ‚ÄúAr, powerful fine pig.‚Äù ‚Äî H. Belloc, in Independent Review, p. 208 (1905)

‚ÄúAr,‚Äù Launce said contemptuously. ‚ÄúYou got a gut-ache or you‚Äôre coming out in boils.‚Äù ‚Äî K. Tennant, Lost Haven, vol. 89 (1946)

City Gent: ‚ÄúAh, lovely isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù Rustic: ‚ÄúAr, ‚Äòtis that.‚Äù ‚Äî G. Chapman et al. Monty Python‚Äôs Flying Circus (1989) vol 1. ii. 15

‚ÄúOoh, big houses them,‚Äù Dolly cooed. ‚ÄúDecent size, ar,‚Äù agreed Pop. ‚Äî K. Aldridge, Pop, p. 210 (2001)

It seems that ‚Äúar‚Äù is more typical of the English countryside than the Spanish Main. I believe that the notion of ""ar"" as piratical began with Robert Newton's portrayal of Long John Silver in the Disney film of Treasure Island (1950). RLS didn't provide Silver with a back story, but rural boys going off to sea when their elder brothers inherited the farm were part of the picture back when.",8,neutral,0.8712847828865051

"Fun puzzle, and (as has often been the case for me of late), a much quicker solve than the Friday puzzle that preceded it.

One cavil? ""The Lord of the Rings"" isn't actually a trilogy; it's one book. It was originally published in three volumes only because of paper shortages and attendant pricing issues in the postwar United Kingdom. The practice stuck, but Tolkien always considered his most famous work to be a single literary entity.",10,positive,0.8937082886695862
