"Well, here's my sad post-game report: Today was my 97th puzzle and I didn't exactly TANK but I certainly did not make the grade, either. I did well in the upper two thirds (even though I didn't know RIMES and had RInkS instead for a while) but the lower third - especially the SW corner - were killer for me. Hay before OAT for way too long, never thought for a second of boxing for canvas.

Ahh, well, I eventually had to do a ""check puzzle,"" which I've been trying (fairly successfully) to avoid doing, except maybe on Saturdays. I, surprisingly, had everything right except in the SW. I guess I'm moderately proud of that. I'll take what I can get. Anyhow, another - tough for me - but fun puzzle! 

I do find myself getting better at the crosswordese, like EPEE the other day... and so I should have gotten CEDE earlier b/c I'm sure I've seen that a few times.

I enjoyed both the clue (""glitter of the snack world"") and answer CHEETO DUST, and WORD SALAD was a fun fill.

Great puzzle!",8,positive,0.9840128421783447
REDSOLOCUP was indeed the funnest answer to plug in. CHEETO DUST was fun too but took a second longer because (pre coffe) I had sORdiD before TORRID for the love affair. And like @JayTee I had a bunch of half answers that took a little work to complete. All in all a very fun Friday! I was almost sad to hear the music in the end lol.,16,positive,0.9472877383232117
Excellent puzzle.   Thank you  for avoiding Star Wars and obscure rapper clues.  Well thought out and a good challenge.,16,positive,0.9448233246803284
"I love the crossword, but let me tell you, for us non-US citizens (and non-native speakers) they can be damn hard. In the early days of the week I can get by with googling tax agencies and abbreviations for health organizations and the like, but starting Thursday (sometimes Wednesday already), the answers I have to straight-up cheat on by finding the solution online, increase exponentially. I'd wager that a typical Friday crossword requires me to look up 25 - 40% of all the answers to even get anywhere.

But I finally subscribed to the Easy Mode newsletter, hopefully that will help. ;)
Still great fun to solve these, now off to Spelling Bee!",27,positive,0.4496878385543823
A ripper of a Friday puzzle. Solved just under my average and loved seeing CHEETO DUST in solve. Thank you Mr. Mehta!,8,positive,0.9822103977203369

"A nice one for misdirection, dresscode instead of STUDENTID at 35A, adeS vs TEAS at 46A, and my favorite, sORdID instead of TORRID for 15D. 

That last one hung me up for a while (CHEEseDUST worked OK for the cross). It might reveal something about my subconscious too.",6,positive,0.7564530372619629

"I managed to get this done a bit under my Friday average, but for the longest time I had a lot of half-answers sitting in my grid. The NW and a lot of the W got filled fairly quickly, along with a few words or partials elsewhere, but gradually I started recognizing phrases, getting things to fall, and correcting mistakes.

Not quite a Weintraub for me, but fairly close, so a big thanks, Hemant, and I'll be looking for more of yours.",7,neutral,0.5711601376533508
Wow.  40% faster than average.  A lot of guesses paid off.  I made a point on the first pass of skipping to the next clue if I did not immediately know an answer.,6,positive,0.9526150226593018
"This was a cornucopia of misfires on my part.

Either it was way above my pay grade or I was (almost) completely out of sync. 
Probably both.

After managing a third of it, auto-check had to come on.
And thank heavens for it. 
Had I been solving on paper, I might have walked away -- something I've not done in my three years of solving (neither doing it on paper nor walking away.)

Touch√©, Mr. Mehta!

Thank you for humbling me.",18,negative,0.595970630645752
"I filled in the north west and thought it was Monday.  Hour ten minutes later? Yep. It‚Äôs a Friday.

The north east slaughtered me:
Cows instead of ISLE. 
LOTTO draws instead of LOTTO BALLS
(Then changed to LOTTO cALLS)
MUse instead of MULL

But all my problems stemmed from sORdID affair instead of TORRID, which I refused to give up on. 

This was a tough one for me. I almost gave up and came to Wordplay for help but I battled through and I‚Äôm proud I toughed it out. 

A huge THANK YOU to Hemant Mehta!",24,negative,0.6305034756660461

"I liked a lot of the answers in this one.  In my time as a young lawyer I got to witness a lot of BLAMESTORMs.  And who doesn‚Äôt love a good MOBIUSSTRIP. I very confidently tried head for strung out sort and didn‚Äôt notice that doing so left me with tuh for thing behind a curtain until I got the dreaded message that at least one square was wrong.

"Fun puzzle with a rather thematic fill, even as a themeless; it's a celebration of American bro culture, with its red solo cups, tipsy bets at the casino, phony boasting, loudly ordering Moet for the table, washing down that bowl of Cheetos with it, like it was water, and that throwback Brut aftershave noodging at the senses (Joe Namath, everybody's favorite JET, pitched Brut on TV back in the 70s-80s: ""The world's a closer place and Brut's part of it, Brut by Faberg√©""), just proving he's just some putz from Tulane, the kind who was always losing his student ID, and that weird ascot of his, like a wannabe Mafia don. Uh oh, looks like that Brut (not the cologne, the champagne) is coming back up in a green wave along with that PBJ he had for lunch, time for me to arise and cede my spot at the table before I get TKO'd by that torrid mud, a word salad made visible. Don't remind me! 

And on the other side of the mobius strip, which is really the same side, there's Lady Hera, who emasculated Zeus (King of the Bros) whenever she could and whose cool Dior elegance and icy stare could, even from afar, tank the hopes of many an ardent odist and send them packing to some distant isle. If only there was a colony of such women across time and space, from Hera to Mamie to Traci to Reese Witherspoon who could set this world aright, ascend the dais and say the words we wish to hear, not that phony word salad, and declare, ""And I mean it.""

"Some surprisingly easy fills that seemed like Mr. Mehta must be whispering them in my ear.  Lots of puns and skewed clues, which made the puzzle entertaining, but it was all over much too soon. Will Saturday be another steamroller and we are getting a breather so we'll be rested up for it?

Your overseas friend should probably tell you that FIELD GOAL(S) not a soccer term.  It is an American football term.   A soccer player simply scores a GOAL when he or she kicks it into the net (or simply past the goal line within the goal area).  An American football kicker kicks a FIELD GOAL through the uprights for three points when his (or occasionally, her) team hasn't been able to score a touchdown for six points (plus one or two extra points), or when a FIELD GOAL would win the game with time running out.",26,neutral,0.8173867464065552
