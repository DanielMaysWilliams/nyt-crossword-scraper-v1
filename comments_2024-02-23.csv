One (perhaps appropriate for me) fifteen letter answer that dawned on me was inspired by 34d:

HOLEINTHEGROUND

Never been in a puzzle, but it's in the Xword Info word lists. 

And... puzzle find today was a Thursday from October 18, 2012 by Samuel A. Donaldson. Five theme answers in that one:

SADDLEINTHEBACK
HOLEINTHEACE
DARKINTHESHOT

I've never read anything by Rilke, but I have good memories of him. A friend of mine got on Jeopardy! and answered a $2000 clue on him correctly. (Now that I double-check it, the clue was basically ""This 20th century German wrote 'Sonnets to Orpheus.' Maybe I should've known that after all!) With control of the board, she picked Sonnets for $800 which had the second Daily Double. She bet everything, got John Milton right, took the lead, and eventually knocked off a longtime champ.

"Outstanding debut Larry Snyder.
Congrats on the debut.
Well crafted, Friday perfect.  Not too hard / not too easy.  It thought the grid art was fun, as well.
Aside from BLEH, no odd fill.  I guess some might quibble with ARO and ITT.
TATTEDUP seemed a bit too 'gansta' for NYT, but I'm glad my guess worked.
This puzzle was LEGIT.


If anyone can explain the lede photo, I'd appreciate it.  I was always Team Katy (over Team Taylor) back in the days of their beef.  But they have since made up, and of course, TayTay is now apparently the most important person on our planet.  So going against TS is grounds for being kancelled for life.",8,positive,0.888671338558197

"Ether is the earliest of the original five elements (air, water, fire, earth come from it) in ayurvedic thought, so I said ""ooookayy"" and popped it in, never knowing a homonym was smacking me upside the head. Numb & number, that's me!

I didn't catch the Escher design till the constructor's notes; glad I read the column first before complaining about the swastika. Just kidding! Plus Escher's stairs are amazing, how the knights atop the castle just keep on going up up up, endlessly. https://web.sbu.edu/theology/bychkov/escher_stairs.html

My old dentist had Escher's ""Day and Night"" (the geese), and every time he worked on me, numb and number on Novacaine, I'd glaze over thinking about the plots of farmland morphing into geese and the two towns below, one white, one black, but identical, next to identical rivers, and was there any interaction between the two, any cross-town romances, any rivalries, gangs of farmers...

A couple other things I loved: TOLD ALL crossing with the SLUMBER PARTY where ""truth or dare"" is played. ""Theranos"" next to ""alleged"" -- talk about an unreliable news source! The combo of Cheese Dip, Haute Cuisine, and Ate One's Words:  many a gourmande has succumbed to a delicious queso & been forced to eat their words -- & more dip. It's not a sacrilege to enjoy yourself! The classic economy of ""whence the phoenix"" - wow!

"Congratulations on your debut, Mr. Snyder!

Had it not been a great solve for me, it would have been enough to take in the Escher-inspired grid.

Had that not done it for me, it would have been enough to find RILKE hidden in the grid.

(His ""Letters To A Young Poet"" made my heart flutter, at the age of fourteen, when I first read it...
  ""Be patient toward all that is 
   unsolved in your heart and 
   try to love the questions 
   themselves [...]  
   Live the questions for now. 
   Perhaps you will then 
   gradually, without noticing it, 
   live along some distant day 
   into the answer."")
                 
And had none of that done it for me, the way all of it did indeed do it for me, well then, Teena Marie and Soul Train would have been enough to wash away any solving blues.

Yet there weren't any solving blues, only red hot entertainment all the way through, and joy from beginning to end.

Mr Snyder, thank you so very much for a Fantastic Friday outing!",22,positive,0.768416166305542
"INJURED before IN SHAPE


Also delayed by TATTooed - and SMH at TATTED UP - just because one can imagine a phrase which might be used in some random situation (""Dude became a yakuza, got all tatted up""), doesn't make it good crossword fill. YMMV",11,negative,0.6541500687599182
"Swiftly done, but that doesn't mean it wasn't intricately constructed and delightful to solve.  I was just lucky enough to be on the right wavelength and synced with clues.

"‚ÄúEarly number‚Äù got me but good. I didn‚Äôt pick up on there being other heteronyms because solving mainly on acrosses I never got to read those clues. For 2D though, with ETHE_ in place and there being left no other noun but ETHER, I *still* didn‚Äôt pick up on the silent ‚Äòb‚Äô in ‚Äònumber.‚Äô I ended up finishing the rest and then running the alphabet on 2D.

Other than that, this puzzle backed up so far up my alley that its back-up beeper alarm scared Se√±or Gato. Wait, can I pass this off as a segue to a gratuitous cat story?

Yeah. I can. 

So Se√±or Gato had his senior check-up today. He waited for the doc to come in very nonplussed already, what with having been brushed first, then tricked into the cat carrier, then hauled off for what he knows is also his monthly shot and nail trim. So he was hunkered down under the bench I sat on. The doc came in, said, ‚ÄúHey, Gato!‚Äù  Gato glowered. The doc took out his stethoscope. Gato popped out from under the bench, ran over to his kitty carrier, hooked his nails into the mesh on its long end, one paw on each side, and started backing up back toward the bench, dragging the damn thing in front of him‚Äîtug, drag, tug, drag‚Äîuntil he completely barricaded himself in with it. 

It was the funniest thing I‚Äôve ever seen him do‚Äîand he fills our days with funny things. All cats and dogs are special, but we really won the lottery with the two fur-kids that adopted us. 

Now returning to regularly scheduled Wordplay programming.",33,neutral,0.5436214804649353
"Congratulations on your NYT debut, Mr. Snyder!

I mostly had a smooth solving, but then that NE corner almost had me. I fell for the misdirection in ‚ÄúWindy location of myth.‚Äù And however many times I see THERANOS in a grid (what a constructor-friendly name that is), I always need a few crosses to get it. But my biggest problem there was sticking with HAUTE CouturE for too long.

Thanks for the challenge!",8,positive,0.5047203302383423
"Cool grid. First pass through I was despairing that I would ever get anything. The first entry I felt secure enough to put in was SRO, but then magically I was dialed in to the puzzle's wave length, so of course it became fun.

"Great puzzle.  Escher‚Äôs staircases were inspired by the real life staircases in Atrani, a small town (officially a city) on the Amalfi Coast, next door to Amalfi. It‚Äôs a magical place and is marked by a series of LABYRINTHian staircases.  It recently opened a small Escher museum.  If you ever go to the area, it‚Äôs worth checking out Atrani. 

I am tempted to post a Rilke poem, but will resist the urge. He‚Äôs a poet who can be appreciated by people not into poetry.  So much to love about this puzzle, including a PIPE ORGAN, which might lure our resident organist David Connell to make an appearance. Thanks, Larry!",27,positive,0.9595686793327332
"Congrats on your debut, Larry. I have to agree -- the staircases make for a lovely grid design.

I left the crossing of ARO and ETHER empty for a bit as I pondered the cluing of 2D. It then dawned on me, which was a good thing because I've never heard of 23A.

The only section of the puzzle that gave me any struggle was the SE, where, like Barry, I initially had TATTooed. It also didn't help that I had STEmS before STEPS. When I got the P, I changed BEGaN to BEGUN and saw the UP.",8,positive,0.876592755317688
