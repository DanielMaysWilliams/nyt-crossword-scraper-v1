"Late to finish today... I'm of two minds.  First, I loved the theme and how the double clues worked.  Cracked that early and had a fun time finding those answers.  Filled the puzzle pretty quickly, but with low confidence.  Then, my second impression is that there are WAY too many natick or natick-ish crosses in this puzzle.   If I don't know the name of a particular kind of stool or the name of a particular artist, I have a square I need to run the alphabet for.  One of those isn't really a problem... but if you add in the following proper name crosses you have a problem:

Iraqi city / Jewelry brand name
Curtain fabric / metrology tool name
Gymnast surname / apple variety name
Musical notation name / Obscure Japanese vegetable

And those are just the ones that had me scratching my head.  I'm sure things I took for granted were a challenge for others.  When you have 3, 4 or 5 of these crosses, you end up needing to get lucky or run the alphabet for hundreds of combinations.  Sure, you can infer that 33D is either ALI or ALY, but that multiplies the number of alphabet runs by 2.  18D is probably a consonant, so again, it isn't 26 letters to try, but we're already up to 40+ and we have 3 more trouble spots to include.

If you don't know either of the words, just just have to run the letters.. there is no puzzling out the name of a city you don't know and a brand name you don't know... you need to just try all the vowels.

"I'm going to pile on here with the compliments: this was a really fun puzzle! In retrospect, 1A perfectly sums it up. Oh yeah, IT'S ON! 

As I commented elsewhere, the echoes from previous puzzles this week added to the fun, without even my usual eye roll: CABOOSES after all the hoopla the other day, and TIVO for what I think is an answer trifecta. (Plus a different clue for AFRO, hooray!)

It has NERVE and ""kick"", and some lovely French words that float on the tongue. I was definitely on the constructor's wavelength with Tito Puente, Neve Campbell, Naomi Osaka, Dean Koontz, even GTE... (I even remembered the correct spelling of ALY Raisman!!) ...and got tripped up on the same vowels as ""everyone"" else: SAMARRA, SENECA, LIRE. 

There were many more. (How about BARER, BEHR, BEHAR??) But really I just wanted to chime in to say how much I loved all the gentle little pun-rhymes at 29D, 40D, 64D, 102A and 115A. TOO CUTE! üòç",8,positive,0.9729975461959839

Apologies to TMBG.] Further flyspecking yielded nothing, because I've never heard of STAYMEN apples, and STAiMAN fits the clue, and like so many others I have a hard time remembering that the gymnast spells her name ALY.

  Fascinating bit from Wikipedia:
The tabouret acquired a more specialized meaning in 17th-century France at the court of Louis XIV in Versailles. Sitting in the presence of the royal family was a much coveted honor, and the tabouret was the way to do it. The court tabouret was an elaborate, upholstered stool with curved wooden legs and tassels, carried by a liveried and wigged servant. Duchesses were automatically granted the honor of sitting in front of the queen. This stool became such a symbol of privilege that when Louis XIV's mother, the Regent Anne of Austria, granted the tabouret to two non-duchesses, such a storm of protest was raised that she had to revoke the order.",5,positive,0.6897833347320557

"Yay, a doable Sunday. For reasons too boring to relate, my brain is a little overwhelmed right now, so getting the theme early on felt like a win. Like Caitlin it was the BLACK EYED PS that pinged the lightbulb. Working out the others was a lot of fun. 
Yes, it was as crunchy as I‚Äôd expect for a Sunday, but knowing the theme was such a help.

As always, the many US centric names and products were the sticking point, but the crosses gave me enough for an educated guess most of the time. I stuck with Casey, as in Casey Jones, at 96A for too long. I remembered the tv show from childhood, perhaps it had started on radio?ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è As 72D and 99 D were complete naticks it was a good a guess as any. Ditto 123A. I had ‚Äòlit a fire‚Äô; it‚Äôs a no-no here, other than in designated fire pits.

The one clunky sounding clue to my English ears was CIDERY. Is that genuinely what they‚Äôre called in the US? Here in Somerset, the home of cider production in the UK, they‚Äôre called cider barns, or just fruit farms. I‚Äôm lucky enough to live in the middle of a large apple and pear orchard. In the next month (if the storm winds ease off) we‚Äôll be surrounded by blossom. It‚Äôs an incredibly beautiful sight.

"Whew. Another long, long workout for me, but a really clever puzzle and a quite enjoyable solve. I actually caught on fairly early with E's ONDOWNTHEROAD, and that made working out each of the theme answers a lot of fun.

Was surprised to finish successfully; probably shouldn't count this one - but... who's counting.

Someone in yesterday's comments mentioned Casey Kasem (thinking of him instead of Ryan Seacrest) and that's the only reason I knew it. It pays to read Wordplay! I don't remember who it was, but thank you.

I had to get CINC from the crosses because I only know POTUS to be Commander in Chief. 
The sad part is that I then stared at CINC thinking it was some americanized version of the French ""cinq"" and, of course, I could make no sense of it. I shrugged my shoulders and carried on. 
It was only after seeing the letters again in the column that it hit me, and then a huge head slap hit me as well. Doh!

It made me smile to see MEAN for ""intend"" since that was my entry yesterday, before ""hope.""
It's really interesting how ""hope"" or MEAN can stand in for ""intend"" but in slightly different ways. English is a phenomenal language, with all its twists and turns.

As I started out by saying, I enjoyed this beautiful puzzle to the max. 
At each Double Duty entry, I stopped to take it in, in awe of the mind that created it. 
The whole solve was a joy, from start to finish.

I actually had simply put the double letters as the rebus but didn't get the music so I changed it to the full words.  Turns out I had a S instead of Y in CIDERY.  Once I fixed that I got the music and the grid turned the words back to the double letters lol.

I lucked out with my guess for 17D/35A, and did think that was a bit difficult for a Sunday, but you're bound to run into a few things you don't know in a puzzle like this. I did pick up some trivia that surprised me, in that the Santana hit ""Oye Como Va"" was a cover of a composition by the 'King of Timbales', Tito PUENTE.

"I came in just under my normal average time and got the rebus early. Naticky crossing of 35A and 17D, oddball words like 125A, and a month‚Äôs worth (has Will really been gone that long? ) of tin-eared/obscure clueing notwithstanding, my biggest complaint today is the excessive letter doubling in the fill. If your rebus gimmick is letter doubling, then IMHO you need to avoid non-theme doubling elsewhere. Otherwise, ‚Äúwhy these but not those?‚Äù Yet I count at least a dozen instances, including one within a theme answer (16D)! This is either sloppy editing and/or insufficient commitment to an already loose theme. 

If this is the best NYT can muster on Sunday, I‚Äôm back to doubting my renewal. I find myself enjoying puzzles in other outlets much more lately. For $40 I think I have a right to expect better than what can be found free elsewhere.",6,neutral,0.5278385281562805
"Well, I'm not sure that I had a rollicking good time, but I got through. It is an impressive puzzle. 

I got the rebuses, mostly from the fairly easy double letter down crosses, E.g. NYANKEE for 72D. But 74A ending in ...THEYY made no sense to my brain. II think I expected the rebus to be identical in the crosses. Although I think I've maybe encountered and not understood similar rebus crossings in earlier puzzles. I will get smart someday (wishful thinking).

The rebus comment is not a complaint, The rebuses were very clever, much more interesting than YY across and down in what I cited above. Now I understand rebusdom a little better. 

I did find some of the trivia (my take, not necessarily anyone else's) obscure. But I'm no purist and after I've filled what I can I'm happy to use DuckDuckGo for inspiration. Generally a lookup makes an entire area clearer. And looking at a map of Iraq and following the Tigris looking for a city that satisfied my crossings was pure joy - I really love maps.
