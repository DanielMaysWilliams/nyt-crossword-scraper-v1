"Here's my debrief, but I'll remain fully dressed, thank you very much! 

There was a lot I enjoyed here, though the SW corner was a sticky mess for me. I had nod AT in 64A, and since I didn't know what AFTRA is, I didn't know SAG, which I know but not in association with AFTRA. I had RADIOE but didn't know the EDIT part. SIDE B wasn't coming to me because of all of the above. I know ""Wouldn't it be Nice,"" but didn't know the album name so I didn't connect it. 

I'm really not good with music clues that aren't about 80s hair bands! Ha!  Although by now I'm used to the rapper names that I never got at first. 

So all that was correct down there was EMO, AMIGO, and OMEGA. I had to Google after I didn't get happy music. I mean, I had nonsensical answers down there so it wasn't a surprise. It's been a while since I had to do a look-up on an early week puzzle. Not a melting face emoji but not heart hands either. üòâ

Really liked the clues for SEE ME, ORAL EXAM, EYES, and DAD (nice to see a nod to stay-at-home dads, instead of moms). Maybe DAD has been clued that way before but I don't recall it in my short time doing the crosswords. 

And I thought the theme was cute, especially the MAYO part. That was a nice closer for the theme!

Despite my own shortcomings, I thought it was SWELL!",11,positive,0.7348615527153015
"On Monday, someone posted that the clue ""homo sapiens"" shouldn't have been used for the entry MAN.  There was a nice thread that followed.  

Last night, I posted that ""stay-at-home"" for DAD was trying to hard.  Was hoping to read some discourse on this, but I see that my post was deleted.  Is this sentiment to 'offensive?'



What am I missing here?  I really would like to understand this.  So pejorative expressions using male references are okay, but female one's are not?  Dad jokes, man-splainin'

"The appreciation of a crossword's cluing is highly subjective, but for me, this one worked. 
It was tricky enough that I had to leave the puzzle and come back to it later (the Deb Amlen approach), but well within my sphere of familiarity to complete without lookups. 

In the middle of the night with insomnia (even the caffeine in one small cup of decaf tea is too much for me after 2pm) I had filled 16A with asKED.

Mr. Bratton's list has only one thing I'd want to HOLD (or would ask you to HOLD)--i.e., the DOOR.  In case you're wondering:  my coat, the baby, a conference, your nose, or (most likely) your horses!

"Oh, I did like the cluing today, which kept my brain engaged rather than on autopilot.

I had to stop for an instant ‚Äì but what a sweet instant ‚Äì to connect that clue to my knowledge base.

This happened enough to elevate this puzzle for me from routine to sweet.  I‚Äôve loved Billy‚Äôs  witty cluing in his themeless puzzles, and even though the clues are dialed down for this early-week puzzle, they were made with care and intelligence. Today's cluing wasn't a collection of retreads.  Bravo, sir! 

BTW, if anyone‚Äôs solving time is a touch longer than usual, it could be because we were given an extra column to solve.  

Some lovely serendipities today.  The clue to the last answer being [Checks out].  The fam feel, with DAD, KIN, and NANA.  A backward ETTAL to echo ET AL.

"Nice synchronicities in this puzzle and the NCAA women's basketball game tonight: Angel Reese, the LSU's star player, had a tiara with her, but alas, heavy is the head that doesn't wear the crown: Iowa's Caitlin Clark put on an unbelievable floor routine, a record 9 three-point shots along with great passing and leadership, a greatness that augurs an career that will place her in the pantheon of all time greats, just as Ali and Ruth are talked of as the GOATS in their sports. Unfortunately the matchup with Angel Reese was marred by an ankle injury that hobbled her, just after she had almost singlehandedly put the Tigers in the lead early in the game. Though she showed her mettle and stayed in the game she was never the same. And no matter how much icy hot you apply or numbing agents ending in --caine, you can't go against Clark with a bum ankle. Anyway, I'm now a convert and am now ready to endorse Caitlin Clark to be the next president of the United States. Trump with his pitiful ""I'm Jesus, etc."" wouldn't stand a chance.

As for the MAYO CLINIC...
I went to Rochester once and met up there with my parents, on a visit to my then 2-year-old niece whose mother worked at the clinic.
My parents and I proceeded to try and get to know the town.  Seeing a sign for the subway, we headed on down the stairs to see where the train would take us. 
But we found ourselves walking through empty narrow corridors, completely baffled. 
Finally, we crossed paths with someone. 
""Excuse me, sir, how do we get to the train platform?""
""What train?"" he asked.
""The subway,"" I said.
""This is it,"" he said as he waved his arm up to the ceiling, down to the floor, and across the walls. ""You're in it.""
