I am familiar with DAIYA but I hate it so I think I chose not to remember it until it was clear non-vegan sour cream brand DAIsy could not be the answer. BONITA should have come to mind more quickly, too, as I have become conversationally fluent in Spanish on such topics as ‚Äúhot people‚Äù and ‚Äúbeaches‚Äù and ‚Äúhot people on beaches‚Äù thanks to my intense obsession with Bad Bunny and his reggaeton compatriots c. 2020-2022, an emotional reaction to COVID‚Äôs devastating impact on my social life (Why go to da club when you can just play ‚ÄúMi Puerto Bonita‚Äù alone in your living room with the lights off?).

Speaking of, I quickly got HASP only because of a recent crossword I did just in the last week or so. I can't remember if it was a daily one or one of the archives but that was a new to me term that I was very happy to be able to pull out today! 

Favorite was 28A (I think) TE AMO! It tricked me and I loved it when I got it.

"Riveting in its difficulty. And it was the most enjoyable kind of difficulty too. I was braced for a puzzle filled with Naticky pop culture names, since both these constructors, separately, have been known to do that a fair amount.  But with the exception of the oddly spelled DAIYA, this puzzle put its challenge in extremely devious clues.

Some were brilliant and some, I thought, were not entirely fair.

Brilliant:  UNO DOS TRES; CHEATS; TEAMO (fabulous secondary use of the word ""profession"" and this clue certainly baffled me for, like, forever); ATOM; TMI (The rest of you also had ETC, yes?)

Not entirely fair:  RISE (Yes, the clue works if you haven't had enough sleep and you're also hung over and you can barely ""make it up"" out of bed, but under normal circumstances, to RISE isn't nearly as onerous as the clue implies).  And PIANO TUNER.  I don't think that there's such a thing as a ""keynote"" on a piano.  You have keys and those keys play notes, but even so...

I had to smile at the crossing of the fill for the clues about Dante and Rendezvous with Rama (APITALIAN and ALIENSHIP). This is because during 2023 I have been reading the Divine Comedy and checking out commentary on Youtube.  And one commentator made a really interesting association between an excerpt in Clarke's novel and Canto 34 of the Inferno. You can check it out here:

https://youtu.be/_hS6FYWU-0g?si=Wo586Ri3mDA_sa0s

As for my attempt to get through the whole Comedia, I am stuck (somewhat aptly) on the terraces of sloth. I am trying to find a better translation of Purgatorio Canto 18 than the one I have  (Mark Musa). It's the canto where Virgil tries to explain to Dante what love is. Chime in if you have a favorite translation! (My knowledge of italian is sadly limited to a couple of units of Duolingo.)",6,positive,0.9299058318138123
"Notes to self: 

Macau is not in New Jersey. 
 
A profession is not always a vocation. 

Working on a keynote doesn't always mean a speech.

Rama has a crew, and they're not from around here.

Not all computers are MACs; PCs have different jargon.

There should be more notes, but this will be enough for now, and I'll THANK ME LATER.

Brooke and Brendan, this crossword is a great one, a crafty, nifty puzzler, and I loved solving it, tough as it was, but the Constructor notes? I haven't a clue.",40,neutral,0.58468097448349
"I got the entire west of the grid pretty quickly but struggled to get a toehold on the east side.  But figured out THANKMELATER from the L in PALS, and I was off.

Was surprised how much I was under my average Friday time.  From a time standpoint, I guess this was easy?  for me.

When I saw who the constructors were after the solve, I was super 'proud' of myself.  Since I consider the constructors pretty tough.  And in combination, probably diabolical.

Solid puzzle.  Nothing too crazy.  No real wordplay, IMO, minus ""telenovela profession"".  But some nice long entries.
I can't really get behind ""meeting extender"" as REHASHING, though.  I mean I get it, but not a fan.

I don't think I've ever written (or read) CYA in a chat.  TTYL.  yes.  peace sign emoji.  yes.  ""i'm out""/""bye""/""gn""  yes.


I'll be interested in reading later how many folks found this easy/hard/just right.

Thanks for the puzzle Brooke and Brendan.",13,positive,0.4857305884361267
"That was fun!  When I got to 14 across I thought ""this can't be UNODOSTRES"" and then cracked up when I realized it could and then almost lost it when I realized it WAS! LOL!  I couldn't wait to hear more about the constructors after that but the column wasn't up yet. 

TEAMO also cracked me up. This puzzle was definitely my vibe.  I think I've used or thought about at least 75% of the answers in the last week or two for various reasons so I didn't have too much trouble.  The NE corner gave me a little static but that's only because I had plopped in moss before SOIL and had a hard time letting it go.  I really loved this one.",26,positive,0.9421862959861755
"Gotta say, with today's puzzle, yesterday's grand finale from Daniel Steinberg, and a slew of other recent ones, the later-week puzzles (especially) have been exceptional.

It's not easy pleasing many of us veteran solvers, but the talent and freshness keeps coming--and we know it ain't easy.

Hats off to you brilliant constructors!",38,positive,0.9705120325088501
"I liked this puzzle especially for its bumpy capricious ornery gallimaufry of words and phrases. It did not have the silken quality of a Weintraub, but it had a certain rickety jauntiness that is just as admirable. Not to do too much rehashing, but the five vertical idioms and single horizontal formed an entertaining sextet, as if trickery and legerdemain was afoot:

Back so soon?
How do you do it?
Thank me later
As I am
Or so it seems...

(I'm kidding)

-- perhaps a reflection on the two types of people in this world, the CHEATS and the KEATS, who wrote:

Beauty is truth, truth beauty,‚Äîthat is all
                Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.

(Final lines of ""Ode to a Grecian Urn"" -- words to live by!)

Also dug the Hispanic quartet of Uno, Dos, Tres, Te Amo, Bonita Dora, and the presence of B-Boys and the duo of backsides made me yearn to hear again that old hiphop classic ""Bonita Applebum"" by A Tribe Called Quest (1990):

"Excellent puzzle! A great combination of fresh entries and clever wordplay made for a satisfying challenge. 

Thanks to Brooke and Brendan. HOW DO YOU DO IT? 

P.S. Fun crossing  of 45A and 47D. When I see CYA I think ‚Äúcover your 19A‚Äù  (or 47D, as the case may be).",10,positive,0.9770827293395996
"Somehow I let the stack of across entries in the W -- 25A, 28A, 32A, and even 35A -- fluster me for a bit. The first three were no-knows, and for 35A, I had ""no KIDDING"" with a tinge of sarcasm instead of the straightforward I'M KIDDING.

For the down entries, I had BACK SO SOON but my mind fog with the across entries prevented me from seeing something DOMAIN NAMES as the answer to 22D. And in place of BEAM, I tried ""rEco,"" as in a recommendation, and in place of TMI, I tried ""fin,"" as in ""finis.""

Finally, the fog lifted when I moved far enough east to MACAU after trying epCot and acCra. Then leD me to change no KIDDING to I'M KIDDING, and the remainder of the grid fell into place.

Whew.",7,neutral,0.6159760355949402

How to end that one had me going for a while.  It was a first-time entry, as were

UNO DOS TRES
THANK ME LATER
ALIEN SHIP
HOW DO YOU DO IT
BACK SO SOON
AP ITALIAN
HARD RESETS 
and also DAIYA and CYA.

DOMAIN NAMES, REHASHING, I'M KIDDING and BBOYS were second-time entries, as well.

Meaning that practically all the marquee entries were new or gently used.

Spanish count?  The Count of Monte Cristo was French.  Dracula was Transylvanian.  But no.  As the famous Count Von Count would say on Sesame Street, UNO DOS TRES...

Address components?  Streets?  Towns?  Zip codes?  No, DOMAIN NAMES...internet addresses.

One working on a keynote?  Guest of honor?  Graduation speaker?  No, just the person who tunes a piano.  By the way, do you know the difference between a piano and a fish?  You can tune a piano, but you can't tune a fish.
