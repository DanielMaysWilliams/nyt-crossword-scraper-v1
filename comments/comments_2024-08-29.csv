"Was at the zoo today and got to see some EMUS in person! Nice that today was one of the days they also showed up in the puzzle itself and not just the comments. 

Fun theme. I knew MINORTHIRD right away but like a few others here, it took a little time to figure out how to parse it in the rebus. 

And I too am sad that we are now at the end of Vertex, as are my kids.

"I did not enjoy this one. I am not opposed to a rebus, but the puzzle better be tight. This one was clunky.

Two of the theme clues were flawed. IKEA STORE is redundant and forced. Who says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to the IKEA STORE?‚Äù More problematic is that WEST when filled in does not make sense if the answer is read to the west: SO WHERE DO TSEWAND.

Other weak answers like TOGAE and OKRAS dragged the puzzle down further.

I did appreciate ZOROASTER, IN ARREARS, CRUSHED ON, and OSCAR WILDE. I guess I will try to dwell on the joy these brought me and hold out hope for tomorrow.",1,negative,0.7882811427116394

"I enjoy a good rebus but this particular puzzle wasn't a favorite for me. To be fair, it probably doesn't help that yesterday's puzzle was (to me) so completely and utterly, puzzle level cloud nine, delightful... leaving me on an all-time puzzle high! 

Anyhow, it took a while but I got it. The revealer came slowly for me but I almost got the rebus picture before that with the SOUTH clue... only, I had only SH, thinking it would be HOLDSHOPE, which made perfect sense for me but resulted in taking longer to see that it was supposed to be fully spelled out directions. 

IKEA baffled me because I knew it had to be IKEA, but what on earth would follow IKEA?! I mean, I know it is a STORE but I really never imagined that was the answer since it's not the name. I did not know the answer in the NORTH so that was no help. And the WEST, I thought should read TSEW. 

But none of that bothered me. I just didn't find anything particularly fun in it. I like fun wordplay and witticisms and I didn't really notice any. But I guess I learned that there are BOSNS and EXURBS in the world...  :-)

So, that's my mileage! 

Here's the fun I did have (you can always find some fun, if you look closely enough): I wanted 20A to be ""Call me,"" which I thought would be cute. Someone else mentioned this but I liked thinking how a broken clock is still right twice a day, as I struggled to decide if the broken clock was FAST or slow.

"Still wading through comments, but wanted to get this out there:

Did enjoy it, and did catch on very quickly to the basic idea; I got the revealer early from just a few crosses, and I knew the answer to 22A could/should be MINOR THIRD. But I didn't think rebus at first; I spelled NORTH upwards, turning EAST when I hit the wall, so 8D was ""tron"" and 8A was THIRD. I guess I convinced myself a [Challenger] was someone who came in third place?

At 15A I had entered OSCAR WILDE as a guess, and OSCAR was fine but WILDE was not working with THIRD above it. So I convinced myself that the quote came from some other OSCAR; I even convinced myself that WILDE would have said ""poorly cast"" rather than ""badly cast"".

Once I finally got rebussy with it and got the happy music I went to find the quote. Here is the more extended version of it:

‚ÄúActors are so fortunate. They can choose whether they will appear in tragedy or in comedy, whether they will suffer or make merry, laugh or shed tears. But in real life it is different. Most men and women are forced to perform parts for which they have no qualifications. Our Guildensterns play Hamlet for us, and our Hamlets have to jest like Prince Hal. The world is a stage, but the play is badly cast.‚Äù

Although nowadays TOGAE are primarily associated with ""beer-me"" frat parties, they were, in fact, not the normal everyday wear in ancient Rome, but worn only by specific persons (Upper class males--although in very early Rome, by women as well) under specific circumstances--when conducting business transactions, receiving clients, or, ahem, convening in the Senate. In that sense, they functioned like the modern business suit. A man was judged by by how carefully he folded and draped his toga, just as today one might be judged on the cut of his suit. One could use the folds of the drapery (""sinuses"") as pockets to conceal little personal belongings--a dagger, say, to slay a tyrant. Most togae unadorned, but there was the ""toga praetexta,"" with a purple hem, which was only worn by certain magistrates, and curiously, by underage boys--sort of like a Victorian ""sailor-suit""

And of course there was the *Toga Zoota"".

DNA(WEST) - Kanye‚Äôs line of genes?
(EAST)ORE - Virtual marketplace?
(SOUTH)OPE - Transplanted Midwesterner‚Äôs ‚ÄúPardon, pardner‚Äù?

"What a terrific idea for a theme, to rebusize the four major directions and have them instruct which way to turn.  Elegant and never-done-before.

Not surprising, given the constructor, whose puzzles shine with devious wit, humor, and skill.  I smiled inside and out when I saw his name atop this puzzle.  Simeon has a bent for Thursdays; 10 of his 14 NYT puzzles have fallen on that day.

This puzzle kept me guessing until close to the end, and that‚Äôs what I want.  I don‚Äôt want to crack the gimmick early on and suddenly have the rest of the puzzle fill in in a flood.

I love sparks of wit in the cluing, which elevate the solving experience.  Today it showed up for me in the clues for BEADS, RED, LYE, ERSE, and the most lovely [Had the best time, say], for WON.

I also love sparks of freshness that come from debut NYT answers, and there were eight today, including the terrific FOLLOW DIRECTIONS and SO WHERE DO WE STAND.

I liked the [Very basic cleaner] double clue for LYE and MOP.  Simeon could have done it another way, cluing MOP and MATEY with [Term for a swab].  I also liked ACME sitting right at the tippy top.

Another sweet one from your fertile mind, Simeon, involving and crackling with wit.  Thank you so much for making this!",30,positive,0.9097815752029419

Admittedly, I have a poor sense of direction, but as I tried to find my way out, I ran into 2 other people who were lost as well.

I also don‚Äôt like when the rebus aspect leaves some clues as just a dumping ground of letters. Eg. The answer for 46. Across technically is DNAWEST.  8 Down is DRINORTH. To achieve its affect so much of the puzzle becomes gibberish. Makes the solve very unsatisfying.

I even had a self-inflicted lol moment when [Doctor's orders] elicited a ""Take two aspirins and call me in the morning.""
