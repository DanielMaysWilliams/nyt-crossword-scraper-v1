Also, REHEARSE for ""Go over the line?"" is great!

I filled in AsAGUESS at 39D and didn't realize that made SEsA, which made no sense. I corrected it and got the happy music, but ATAGUESS didn't seem right to me....

Add a fabulously fun, completely unexpected column photo and the whole program leaves an afterglow that makes me very grateful for all the effort required to put it all together and get it so right.

"In trying to guess the revealer without reading the revealer clue, I got the whole thing bass-ackwards.  Since the original phrase didn't end in a real meat and the meat was a substitute for the real word, I was thinking of one of these ghastly substitutes made with some sort of awful soy product.  But what?

MEAT SUBSTITUTES?  Too long.  IMITATION MEAT?  SOY-BASED MEAT? ERSATZ MEAT?  I gave up.

I was on the wrong track -- and I smiled broadly when MAKE ENDS MEAT came in.  ""That's nice -- that's very, very nice,"" I thought.

I got all the theme answers with no more than two letters -- the clues were both easy and fair -- with the exception of WHAT A BOAR.  But while the themed part of the puzzle was easy, there were other clues I found puzzling.   I should know that two up quarks and a down quark = a PROTON?  Well, actually, probably I should -- but I didn't.

And what's a ""bouncy castle"" that's filled with AIR?  A balloon?

Oh so that's the derivation of AEGIS (as in under the aegis of).  I didn't know that!  It's very interesting and I feel more protected already.

And there are just about no names!!!!!  What a splendid Tuesday puzzle!",14,negative,0.5537559390068054

One small, well, not a nit but a question‚Ä¶did anyone else get stuck briefly by 1A, ‚ÄúTackle, as a crossword‚Äù?

"I laughed at the WURST thing - my wife and I often use that wurst/worst play-on-words when mixing German and English into our private language, which is mostly Polish, but possibly would not be recognized as such by anybody else but us.

I got the theme, mostly, which is not a given when phonetics are involved. Is ""what a bore"" a quote from Charlotte's Web? In this clue all I understand is bore and BOAR sounding the same (or was it not bore at all, but some other word?), but everything else is a mystery.

The SW corner was very hard for me today, possibly even the WURST.  AEGIS was a gimme, RES came to me quickly, even though it is not used in Polish legalese (I may be a lawyer btw, but I am also a huge hater of legalese), and I somehow remembered GAUCHE, with crosses, but I needed to look up GRE and do some mental gymnastics to finish that part of the puzzle. I managed in the end, which I am somewhat proud of. My solve time was closer to Wednesday levels though, which has become quite common on Tuesdays in the past few months. My Tuesday PB is 7ish minutes, and lately I've been doing Tuesday puzzles in 12-14ish minutes.

I still don't get ""Tee preceder:ESS"". Esstee? ST? The only STs I know are: 1. a line of fast-ish Fords, 2. gamer shorthand for single target damage (rather than AoE, area of effect). I would appreciate an explanation :)",8,neutral,0.515425980091095

Confirmed TABOR fit the 28A clue, couldn't figure out where else my error could be, thought it might be EApE in 56D but thought the error was in the first square even though I didn't know what else could complete GAUCH_. Ran the autocheck for the first time ever on a Tuesday puzzle... and it was the 58D/67A cross I got wrong, even though 67A was covered in the column. I think I got misled by the column saying the two words were similar, so even though I'd just read it, after filling APIAN on 14A I naturally drifted to ApIARY on 67A and didn't bother to wonder if it was right until the end because ""it was in the column, therefore I already know it's right!"" ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",3,neutral,0.5120527744293213
