‚Ä¢ As a serendipitous theme echo, many answers are movie titles: ORCA (1977), AGENDA (2007), MAZE (2000), BRUTAL (2007, 2012), EPIC (2013), BALI (2007), CLUE (1985), EULOGY (2004), SARA (1997, 2019), SEEDS (2018, 2020).  I‚Äôm guessing there are more.

I don‚Äôt know why, but I love movie titles with exclamation points, like ‚ÄúAirplane!‚Äù and ‚ÄúMars Attacks!‚Äù  So, I started looking through the grid for more such titles that will never happen, but, to me at least, would be funny to see: ‚ÄúALGA!‚Äù, ‚ÄúENIAC!‚Äù, ‚ÄúBAES!‚Äù, ‚ÄúUKE!‚Äù, ‚ÄúPILAF!‚Äù.

"I really struggled with three clues with Taw and Tali crossing with Wired. Maybe it's just me but I had never heard of either Tali or Taw (Talus was rolling around in my mind somewhere, but not something I would have ever come up with enough to then change it to the irregular plural). And Wired is an extremely esoteric movie. It could have easily been ""tired"" or ""cured"" or probably a few others. The combination of all three made it an impossible corner for me.

I liked the clues for the movies, but like another commenter, I was confused by it being about the titles rather than about the movie itself. 

I am not fond of ""unsafe"" being a clue for ""out"". It kind of reminds me of someone using a thesaurus and not understanding the nuance of the word. It just doesn't quite fit the way ""not safe"" would. Maybe that's just me being a little too pedantic though :)

"15D PALM OIL was a wheelhouse gimme for me because I spend a lot of my time on conservation issues and have a passion for orangutans, who are particularly affected by unsustainable palm oil plantations. Palm oil is in about half of the household products in the U.S., including foods like crackers, ice cream, and candies and toiletry items like soaps, lotions, and cosmetics.  

The good thing about palm oil is that it is a very efficient crop, yielding much more oil per acre with less water and chemicals than other oil crops.  This means that banning palm oil isn't the solution. Furthermore, it is often impossible to determine if palm oil is in a product because there are dozens of substances derived from it and, in the U.S., it can be simply labeled vegetable oil. 

The best approach that I know is to press for certified sustainable palm oil made by producers committed to ending deforestation.  You can use the free PalmOil Scan App, created by the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums with the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, to scan or type in products as you shop. See  https://wazapalmoil.org/ and https://www.zoo.org/palmoil for more information.  If you‚Äôre buying candy for Halloween, take a look at the list on the latter site.

"Good to see TAW in this puzzle, but made doubly pleasurable by the appearance of AGGIE; a game of marbles would be much the lesser without aggies. A triple feature, of sorts, would have been cat's eyes (another kind of marble). 

MANHATTAN HOOKUP. What a gem. 

Azure blue seemed a little redundant, but the more I thought of it, the more I withdrew my original objection. There's banana yellow, after all, and navy blue is a common term, and I bought a sweater last year on Amazon that was ""available in Trump orange."" But I haven't seen a color associated with his running mate. Perhaps that mutable hue, chameleon? Hillbilly Lily?

Giant (1956) is a really good movie, with a standout performance by the mesmerizing James Dean, and made from a surprisingly good novel by Edna Ferber, recording the generations of turmoil in a Texas family spanning the 1920s to the 1950s. 

The constructor sounds like a nice guy, a good life, writing plays, volunteering for NASA (the program sounds like a delegation to greet ETs if and when they arrive. Indeed, if I was on the delegation I'd be thinking about what people should wear to such an event, go casual? wear a tux? pack heat? Not to mention catering, a good dj, maybe an open bar, you think they might be orthodox ETs or just galaxy surfers looking to party? So many questions!) and this is a swell puzzle. He's a bit coy about what was left out of his 2017 puzzle but restored here: can anyone clue me in?",21,positive,0.8932437300682068
"It was fine, but I really think the puzzle suffers by NOT repeating the prefix ""marquee at the tri-plex mistaken as a promo for"" at the begining of EACH theme clue.  Why would I merely assume it applied for the ones after the first one.  I wouldn't, and didn't.  Clues are presumed to stand on their own unless there is SOME indication they are connected.

Even then I personally found it all a little underwhelming.  As I said, it was fine, okay for an easy lazy Saturday night / Sunday.  Just didn't really float my boat.

Some additional future blockbusters hidden in the puzzle:

ITCHY PEST TYPE:  A documentary comparing Scotland‚Äôs midges with Maine‚Äôs black flies.

EPIC KAFKA AGENDA: A horror film taking place entirely during a staff meeting run by a large cockroach.

CHURN TASK UPSET: A newly discovered Buster Keaton in which the hapless hero has hilarious mishaps making butter.",25,neutral,0.6839538216590881
Enjoyed the humor of the clue Independence Day? Answer being Hancock Signs The Paper as the Movie Independence Day and Hancock both star Will Smith. Not sure if that was deliberate or not though.,11,positive,0.7383953332901001
"I remember July 17, 2016!!! Who doesn‚Äôt? It was the day we all thought nothing at all had happened to anyone anywhere ‚Ä¶ and now it‚Äôs confirmed!

JK! We all remember turning points in our lives that nobody else noticed ‚Ä¶ kinda like wetting our pants in the rain.

Nice puzzle. Quick.",5,neutral,0.48438894748687744
"Wow, finding examples that combine three movie titles to totally encapsulate a fourth movie title is quite impressive. I love MANHATTAN HOOK UP for Sex and the City. 

Great clues for ITCHY (‚ÄúHaving had a few bites, say‚Äù) and EMAILER (‚ÄúPerson with attachment issues, perhaps‚Äù).

Final flyspeck‚Ä¶..there is no movie entitled tIRED.

Nicely done, Jerry.
