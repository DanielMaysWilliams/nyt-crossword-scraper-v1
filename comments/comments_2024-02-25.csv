"Absolutely Brilliant Puzzle!!!
Lots of fun and a few giggles. It was a pleasure to solve. Hats off to both Scott Hogan and Katie Hale.

I was thinking Katie Hale was must be adept at the British Cryptic Crosswords as well as setting many an English Crossword in addition to constructing the American version.

I often try my luck at the British puzzles but have yet to develop a knack. I can't understand why it seems such a challenge but I assume it's because it's so rare I come across them.  

Will Shortz will change that when he finally decides it's the most logical addition to the ever expanding NYT Games Section. It's already a staple across the Atlantic and my bet is the British Cryptic Crossword will become the next ""it game"" here. Katie Hale might just become the first to set the British Crossword for the NYT.",3,positive,0.9412416219711304

"Garden GNOME reminded me of the horror of travelling west out of Poland in the 1990s. There were no autostradas then (autostrada is what a wide, multi-lane fast-traffic road is called in Polish, from the Italian), so all traffic travelled on narrow roads through fields and forests. On the sides of those roads and at roadside rest areas there were hundreds of stalls where Polish people sold wildly painted plaster garden ornaments, mostly gnomes, bit also deer, windmills etc. It was so horribly tacky it made my eyes hurt. All those pointed hats, dead, painted eyes, grinning faces, mooning buttocks... It was the stuff of nightmares.

So why all of the gnomes, and why in Western Poland specifically? Because the Germans loved their gnomes back then, and they flocked to Poland to buy them dirt cheap.
