"When I saw Rebecca & Will listed as the constructors my first thought was ""YAY!"" I'm often on Rebecca's cluing wavelength and was sure Will would do something clever with the grid. They did not disappoint! (And it was reassuring to know that even master constructors like the two of them needed a few passes to make a grid as clean and awesome as this final product.)

I mis-read 44A as ""tiled windows"" and my brain went down the path of stained glass mosaics. When I came back to that clue I corrected myself and read ""titled windows"" but that made no sense so I move on to another section. Finally, the third time I returned to that clue I only was missing 2 letters, and said thank you to Downton Abbey for knowing DOWAGER.

Some of my other favorite parts included seeing RESPAWN in a grid, reference to SACHAR's ""Holes"" and the clever clues in 15A: Quick second? 62D: One hopping on the band wagon? 89A: Sour grapes drink? and 100A: Sub domain. :)",3,positive,0.9291346073150635

"I finished the Saturday and Sunday puzzles yesterday. I really enjoyed both.  It occurred to me that while I perceived both as relatively hard, I enjoyed the challenge and felt so satisfied solving.  Some puzzles that are just as ""hard"" aren't as satisfying. I've been thinking about that as I read the yeas and nays of the comments.  The totality of our experience seems to determine how hard we perceive a puzzle.  Those of us that are drawn to wanting to solve word puzzles are already a specific group who have an innate ability to understand and enjoy language.  So why are some puzzles more satisfying than others? I don't know about other folks, but for me it's the images and experiences that the words in the puzzle conjure.  It's the wit, humor and joy of the words and how they connect to the very personal mental library that they touch.  Like opening a book. 

Just a little Sunday afternoon musings.  I loved this Sunday puzzle. It brought up memories of being in the amusement park with my kids growing up. It was a joy to solve.

"Well since I live 5 minutes from an amusement park, this one came pretty easy, in spite of the fact that my adventures on rides are limited to our porch swing and even then I get seasick. Like others TIL enneads, always fun.

Sadly, our park now finds bumpercars ‚Äútoo dangerous‚Äù so you don‚Äôt actually get to ram your friends, you just have to have a stately little excursion around the floor. They took away that one where you got thrown off the spinny center, too, and also the big barrel one that pasted you to the walls and then the bottom dropped out. A great lesson in centrifugal force.

"All done, hah OK, it‚Äôs things at an amusement park, and then CHEST HAIR jumps out at me.  Well then‚Ä¶some games of skill in which you might win the plushie animal:

‚ÄúChest hair‚Äù: you have to guess whether the other contestant has more or less than Tom Selleck.

‚ÄúDowagers‚Äù: you have to guess the other contestant‚Äôs age. What a crowd pleaser!

‚ÄúParsecs and parcels‚Äù: given a rectangular package, you have to guess its dimensions in parsecs.

"I'm sad to report that the drop tower video in the column is fake. I went to YouTube to see it better and the real ride is nothing like the video according to people who've been.

"It was no tilt a whirl but it was a good ride! I'm not much for the up side down and big drop rides but I love the tilt a whirl!  Wheeeee!!

WHAC-A-MOLE reminded me of that super fun whack-a-mole puzzle from maybe spring of this year. I adored it! Especially the graphics at the end. 

This one was also fun and once I figured out how the circles worked they helped on some tricky spots. I came in under average but it might have been a personal best if I hadn't sat out on our garden balcony. I get distracted out here in good ways. But it's also harder to do Sundays from my phone. Usually I do them on my computer. 

Because of that, it was difficult finding my error when I didn't get the happy music. I was so glad I've previously read the ever wise and helpful @Eric Hougland's suggestion to look for errors in list view. I'm not sure I would have found it on my phone without it! I had accidentally changed the A in SAGE to an O. 

I think my favorite was the humble ASST because that was a big aha when I understood the clever clue. I also really enjoyed the Sound of Music reference there with PARCELS -- and I liked it crossing with PARSEC!  LLAMA was cute and clever too! Very enjoyable all around!! Especially surrounded by our beloved plants and tacky balcony decorations! ü¶©ü¶©

I don't know much about such things but it seems like a pretty impressive feat of construction!!

"Randos:
The HAM 'n' Pineapple Hawaiian Pizza was, in fact, invented in 1962 by the Greek-born restauranteur Sam Panapoulos in the Southwest Ontario town of Chatham.

Torakusu Yamaha's first passion was for neither pianos or motorcycles, but for reed ORGANs. The path from the manufacture of organs to that of pianos seems fairly direct--from pianos to motorcycles, less so. I guess the craft of piano-building translated into a skill for fine wood-working. Hence, In a nutshell, as worded by Wikipedia: 

""Yamaha was contracted to manufacture wooden and (later) metal airplane propellers by the Japanese government during World War II. The company struggled in the aftermath of the war, and in the early 1950s, chairman Genichi Kawakami decided to repurpose its underutilized war-time facilities to manufacture small motorcycles for leisure use."" 

The musical instrument/electronic and motor-power divisions have been subsequently spun off into separate corporations. 
Nevertheless, all Yamaha products--whether motorcycles, CD-players, flugelhorns, or my beloved C-1--bear the same corporate logo--or *mon*--of three interlocked tuning forks.

"At ROLLER COASTER, I looked over the whole design of the puzzle and thought, ""This is amazing! It must have been a beast to construct!"" 

What astounded me even more was that it can't be an easy feat to let the puzzle itself take center-stage and not be overshadowed by an in-your-face construction marvel.  But a marvel it is. And it speaks to Rebecca's and Will's undeniable expertise.

I'm sure many will find this ""an easy Sunday"" but I, for one, love me a tranquil flow in such a large grid. In my opinion, this is yet another testament to the expertise behind it, the uncluttered fill that makes everything seem easy.

I loved that there were plenty of clever misdirects sprinkled about a variety of fill, and that the challenges weren't hair-pulling ones and totally inferable.

And of course there was the laughter, what with CHEST HAIR being the right answer for what I thought I was just being goofy about. 
No, they didn't...oh yes they did! Hah!

Thank you so much, Rebecca and Will. You're truly powerhouse constructors!",67,positive,0.9581359624862671
"I had just gotten up from a nap when I started this puzzle, and it showed at first.  My mind was groggy when I started, but in the end, I came in a few minutes below my Sunday average.

Amusement parks were never my thing.  Well, maybe when I was eight years old, but I never understood why my peers were still excited by them when I was in high school and even later.  I had a friend when I was in my mid-20s who went off to the arcade when we were at an amusement park or a fair, and I thought that to be quite juvenile, but it seems to be fairly common these days.  Except it's all done at home these days.  At least most of the time.

But the theme of the circles forming the shapes of the attractions was cute.  Always something different in crossword.

And Will and Rebecca always deliver a quality puzzle.",12,negative,0.4966195821762085

"I know some folks dislike circles, but I had great fun discovering the significance of each particular grouping. 

I immediately noticed CAR RAC (BUMPER CARS) and the dropped TOWER. Noticing the weaving ROLLER COASTER helped me solve the tricky section around PARSEC. 

I didn‚Äôt notice the sliding WATER or M, MO, MOL, MOLE until after completion. 

Great clue for the common entry ASST.  I love how in this case ‚Äúquick‚Äù indicated an abbreviation. So clever. 

Thanks Rebecca and Will. This indeed was an amusing ride!",28,positive,0.936296820640564
