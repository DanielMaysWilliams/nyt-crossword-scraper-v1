Ok, then I want to point out how brilliant I am by knowing that the there's only one day a year when the sun rises EXACTLY in the EAST.  Otherwise it rises is a easterly direction, but it also somewhat north or south.

There.  I've done my job in trying to show how much more intelligent I am than the those who write the clues.

"One of the language-centered podcasts I listen to just dropped an episode I think a lot of people here will like. Helen Zaltzman's The Allusionist's most recent episode is titled ""Word Play Part 4: Good Grids."" It's about crossword construction, with a focus on newer constructors bringing newer and more diverse points of view to puzzles. (If you think crosswords are not allowed to change with the times, or if you're easily triggered by inclusion and diversity, you might want to skip it.) 

The guests include constructors Erik Agard, Juliana Pache, Rachel Fabi, and Adrian Johnson.

I don't agree with everything I heard, but it was time well spent (<40 minutes if you skip the ads).

Being in Honduras still is why I only completed Sunday's puzzle today. Was happy to get a gold star since I was late... I got to it before I started todays, maybe that's why. 

We had more visitors this weekend, which prevented me from doing more than just a handful of Sunday's clues. But I wanted to thank everyone who answered my question from yesterday morning about why my comment disappeared on Saturday's puzzle. I appreciate the insight!  

I also really enjoyed Sunday's puzzle, even though I'm not very UP on my Pixar films. EUPHORIA was when I first suspected a rebus and BRAVE NEW WORLD sealed the deal! After all, a gram is better than a damn! Fortunately, I vaguely remembered BRAVE being a movie, so I was able to figure out how the rebuses work. Some were much more obvious than others but in any case it was a fun puzzle and I enjoyed it a lot!

If one day just isn't sufficient to properly celebrate this sport for you, Miniature Golf Day is an international celebration held on September 21!

Another meticulous piece of grid construction that leaves the solver entirely out of the process.  Now, if we couldn't have solved any of the ""O""-containing answers -- the ""O"" representing the golf ball, right? -- without first having to figure out the conceit, well that would have been exciting and challenging.

"Jeremy has an artistic background, having attended a magnet high school for the visual arts, the Art Institute of Dallas, and then an N.Y.U. grad program in code-driven art installations.  Two thirds of his 27 NYT puzzles have fallen on Sundays, and most of them involve visual elements.

He also incorporates those elements in his 15 x 15 puzzles, such as his terrific WORK/LIFE puzzle (March 9, 2017).  

His puzzles are technically superb, today‚Äôs no exception.  It‚Äôs already been mentioned that there are no O‚Äôs in the grid aside from the golf ball‚Äôs bath (Hi, @Steve L!), and that the path travels through all three words of HOLE INONE SHOT.  But also, I love that the path that the golf ball takes is perfectly symmetrical!

In addition, the cluing kept my brain engaged, even on Easy Monday.  Several times I filled in an answer only to have to erase it and put in another.  That rarely happens to me on a Monday, and I love it!

Lovely serendipities as well.  How the theme of O‚Äôs is echoed by OWE.  Three palindromes (LOL, AMA, URU).  How TEE and CUP together make ‚Äúteacup‚Äù ‚Äì it‚Äôs a silly coincidence, I know, but I love silly coincidences like this!

"Holey cow, not a lie when I say I am impressed.  A grid that's late week worthy made with a bag of Monday clues‚Äîthat could not have been easy, and the playful rolling shot at the finale was a tribute to the constructor and to the players as well.

I was not expecting such a fun puzzle this evening and was delighted by the one you made for us, Jeremy Newton.  (Do you by any chance know Rory McIlroy?‚ÄîHe had a great game today, too!)",18,positive,0.947441816329956

"Very easy but fun puzzle. However, I was a bit surprised by the clue for 38-A. Surely there must have been a better way to clue that without making it sound really dirty? I‚Äôm actually amazed it got published as-is. I know my mind instantly makes leaps to the worst places like that, but surely someone must have noticed the almost certainly unintentional double entendre there?",2,negative,0.4071924686431885

There‚Äôs an added layer of elegance in the puzzle. There are so many O‚Äôs in straight lines as the ball caroms around to get from tee to cup, but there isn‚Äôt a single other O anywhere but in that long path. 

Very cool!",103,neutral,0.6615505814552307
I just had to pop in and say how much I appreciated the work that obviously went into the construction of this puzzle. The animation at the conclusion was the icing on the cake.

"Sorry that this is a Sunday puzzle question -  but I didn‚Äôt know where else to ask. Has anyone else had an issue with the Sunday puzzle not showing complete even though finished, i.e. not showing the yellow star? Also not showing up in my stats. When I finished the puzzle, the congratulations message came up with the time it took to complete and when I go back into the puzzle, the time does not advance anymore, so it makes me think it was completed correctly. Needless to say I have tripled check my answers with the answer key! I have  a 511 day streak going that I‚Äôm afraid to lose through some glitch. I‚Äôm afraid to start the Monday puzzle until the Sunday shows complete. Thanks for any advice.",1,negative,0.49303650856018066

"Just an aside. Since the comments are already closed for the Sunday puzzle I thought I would add here that the late comment by @CRO from NYC ( the outrage at the editors for some of the rebus squares) I took as a somewhat clever joke comment.
( Hence my recco.) CRO only picked a few of the rebus entries to complain about so it just didn‚Äôt make sense to me. I responded in agreement about variant use of words and regionalisms. I hope everyone understands my comments were completely in jest

"Not only a great theme, a theme that spanned the entire puzzle! Excellent, excellent job",32,positive,0.9868756532669067
"I have rarely if ever enjoyed a Monday puzzle so much. Although it was a breeze of ease, it was somehow tasty all the same. I mean even before the theme, it was just somehow fluid... some Monday puzzles somehow satisfy despite not having ""difficulty"", and this was like that. Like one of those pleasant tunes that's simple but somehow puts your mind at ease, as you nod with pleasure at its almost Taoist 'yes'ness. Plus a few little morsels, tidbits of whimsical crunch, like ""Addictive thing in one's pocket"" (PHONE), ""Site for skeletons"" (CLOSET), a cute PuzzPair as Lewis would call it of AQUA and AQUI (and ACOW?), and this is all even before counting the theme!

For some reason my app didn't do the animation, which I didn't realize it was s'posed to do, but I supplied the sound effects: as I looked for the O's I went ""deedle-deedle-leedle-leedle-deedle-deedle-deedle leedle-deedle-deedle-dooooo"" as my finger traced its path.

It's lovely to have a light meal like a Monday puzzle be so delectable. Thank you, Jeremy Newton! No wonder they named the international metric unit of force after you!",51,positive,0.9072548151016235
"Can I just say, I'm still smiling and I finished the puzzle ten minutes ago.

This is the kind of puzzle that keeps me addicted to crosswords, and fascinated by constructors' creativity and skill.
A real feat of construction!
And that's, erm, putting it mildly.

I don't play golf, and whatever I know, I learned here. 
And so, when I saw the CUP (which I didn't even know went by that name), I thought uh-oh. But pretty soon, I was wanting to know what it was all about, and, inch by inch and word by word, was rewarded for peeling the layers.

It turned out to be an immensely satisfying solve, and the animation added even more joy to it. 
Kudos to Mr. Newton, Joel Fagliano, and the editorial and graphics team.
(Still smiling.)
