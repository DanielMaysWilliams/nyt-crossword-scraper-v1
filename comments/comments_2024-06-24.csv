"I‚Äôve just started playing NYT crosswords a couple months ago and I‚Äôve noticed a fair amount of words are repeated in NYT crosswords, not on the same day obviously, and not necessarily day-after-day, but I‚Äôll notice a word that was just used a few days ago or a week ago and then it‚Äôll pop up again the next week.

I did the puzzle in jig time, though I had misread a couple of clues (eye drops! arrgh) and at 47A --seeing BACK with 4 more spaces, and having read only the first line of the clue--entered BACKDROP.  Bzzt!

"Seemed a bit tougher than most Monday to me. That's not a complaint! 

I was surprised that the biologists who piped up about ALGAE yesterday are absent re: 29D. Note: I have no problem at all with the clue and answer, but I am hoping some folks here might find these details interesting. If not, scroll on past...

Technically, echinoderms are bilateral. However, since most have adopted a sedentary existence, and there is no need for a front end, they have secondarily (over evolutionary history) become radial -- sort of. Many textbooks will describe them as pentaradial, reflecting that most have a five-part symmetry. But wait -- what about Leptasterias, the six-armed sea star (note: most biologists don't call them starfish, since they are not fish. This is similar to most biologists never, ever using the execrable ""octopi"" as the plural of octopus) or... some species of Luidia, which have seven arms - or more! Or the sunflower star, my favorite Pycnopodia -- you should google this. Up to a couple dozen arms, and large, and lovely. Etc. etc.

But most adult echinoderms have a distinct radial symmetry. So the clue and answer are fine. Oh - what about that little button on the top - the madreporite? Off-center.... this makes it actually bilateral. 

I could continue with a discussion of sea cucumbers and sand dollars, but the clue referred to sea stars, so.. 

All echinoderm larvae are distinctly bilateral, reflecting the bilateral history of the group as a whole. Time to end...",13,neutral,0.5973626375198364

"Nifty theme.  It took a lot of cleverness to come up with it, but, alas, no special brilliance to solve it.  Though I did think the puzzle played a bit harder than most Mondays, what with IKEBANA, which I didn't know and AGLETS, which I did.

AGLETS -- a crossword puzzle word that probably no one has used in real life ever.

When I see a theme this clever -- but one leaving me with nothing to do but fill it in -- I always wish that there were some way to force me to have to figure it out myself with no help.  Maybe a vaguely clued and totally uncrossed BODY BUILDING isolated from the rest of the puzzle.  The clue might read: ""A goal of certain types of athletes that will explain both halves of the starred clues.  Can you figure it out?""

The only problem?  I could stare at the theme answers until the cows came home and I wouldn't have the slightest idea.  Cute idea and great execution, Anthony.",6,neutral,0.5115206241607666

"A fun Monday, with a sprinkling of Japanese!

In March 2020, 
our youngest son was weeks from 
his undergrad graduation. 
He finished via Zoom, 
and we spent the next year like
many others-

not learning how to knit
not cleaning out the basement
not planting an herb garden‚Ä¶

Except my kid.
He had a daily schedule.
Set his alarm, showered *daily*(!)
applied to 22 medical schools,
and learned to speak Japanese.

Not gonna lie, it was a *wee* bit annoying
to be shown up daily by our boy.

But I loved hearing him FaceTiming at the
dining room table with strangers in Japan,
who would just chat with him for an hour.

And now he‚Äôs engaged to a lovely‚Ä¶

"Fun theme!

Some thoughts: 

TIL some Japanese words (UDO, IKEBANA)

I envision water coming from Old Faithful, but, sure, STEAM as well

I always rely on crossings for the names of things that I never use in a sentence (AGLETS)

And, public service announcement: not all weightlifters pursue body building (though they may achieve it). Some are bodybuilders, who will be judged on their appearance, and others are powerlifters, who will be judged on what they can *do* (lift).  

Many simply seek increased functionality in everyday life.

"Wonderful debut! Shindig, what great word, apparently been around since the 1850s - when people dance so wildly they kick one another's shins. I guess you could use KNEEPADS when going to one!

I also dig (and my shins dig it, too), in the cluing for sofa, the word ""doghouse,"" since dogs sometimes mean one's feet (as in, ""After that long TREK my dogs are really aching!"") so DOGHOUSE is kind of a spare themer. Hard to think of others. ELBOW ROOM maybe? BACKSTAGE? 

Glad they let you get away with UDO on a Monday: I had to use my noodle -- and I'm not talking my udon -- to come up with that one. That and Ikebana, very sleek indeed. Enjoyed RUBIO crossing with FRAUDS, but that's because haters gonna hate! 

MINI theme alert with those Watergate TAPES, as the initial act was the break-in of the DNC HEADQUARTERS. They could never get Nixon to ADMIT to any BACKROOM plotting, nor was it ever shown how Rose Mary Woods could accidentally SLIP and erase a crucial 18.5 minutes of those tapes. After Nixon delivered his resignation speech he famously gave America a THUMBS up.

But no need to call the crosswording HEARSE for me yet...  I wasn't totally ROUTed. It only WHETS my appetite for more! 

Anyhow, fun puzzle! I enjoyed doing it! Favorite was FAULT! Also, UDO because I like how it drops down into UDON, and then over to IKEBANA. Sort of meta... maybe, I don't know. I also like that IRON is connected nonchalantly (in my mind) to the theme. I wish it crossed BODY BUILDING though.
