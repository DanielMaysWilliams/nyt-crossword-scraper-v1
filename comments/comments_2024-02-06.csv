"Loved this puzzle! Best Tuesday in years. So playful -- and with such funny and offbeat themers.

They supplied a welcome level of puzzlement that I wasn't expecting so early in the week. I fell completely for the first themer, SPICE DRUM. ""They make spice containers that big?"" I wondered. ""Gee, my spice containers are really small. Do I not have a SPICE DRUM because I'm not much of a cook? Or is it because my NYC apartment kitchen is too small to accommodate one?""

I still hadn't completely figured out the gimmick at LOVE DONE for the gist of a ""Dear John"" level. ""Gee, what an usual way to put it,"" I thought. ""But I suppose, when you come to think about it...""

The parsing aspect dawned on me at FORGE DALLIANCES/FORGED ALLIANCES. I went and re-parsed all my previous answers before moving on to complete my solve.

I'm addressing your objection to the 1A clue here to avoid getting lost in the six appearances of your post last night.

If that is correct, it is not ""favoring a Christocentric view of the Bible"" to speak of a ""Book after II Chronicles.""

From the very start, it was great to see my dear niece Beli's name featured in the puzzle; I'll have to call and tell her! (She's in Seminary right now, doing epigraphical research into the O. T.  Book of Boaz.)

And who could forget Piece Brosnan's role as Remington Speele, with Palia Shire as his wife, in that sit-com about the First Gentleman and the Mayor of Natick, Mass.--I especially loved the episode where they vacationed in the Mediterranean, collecting stones on the beaches of Elba.

And the revealer  which could be parsed *three* ways!

First of all, you have to come up with it in the first place.  How did Victor do that?  This is a theme that comes from the nether reaches of left field.  Maybe he saw, say, LOVED ONE, in a book, his brain tapped him on the shoulder with LOVE DONE, and he thought, ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶‚Äù.  But then‚Ä¶

How do you come up with more of these?  And of specific lengths to meet the requirements of grid symmetry?  AND have them be ‚ÄúHah!‚Äù-worthy.  There have been some stabs in the comments at more of these theme answers, but, IMO, none as good as the ones in this puzzle.
