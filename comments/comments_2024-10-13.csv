Was the themed idiom actually about knowing a SCalE and the golfer named dale?!). These, combined with the fact that “A lOt” and “A TON” both worked for 11D, meant there were far too many permutations to cycle through.

"Spending the Thanksgiving weekend at my Sister-in-law's in Leamington, ON, and, as distraction from the ensuing hilarity, tried my hand at Zorse.

Well, it would make a cute gimmick for a Sunday crossword (actually, I know it has, more than once), but will it have the staying power to carry a daily game? I doubt it; but then, I've only done Threads once, have pretty much dropped Connections, and even stopped doing Wordle, even before my Opening Word came up as a hole-in-one.

Before he ate even one, he walked down the line and proceeded to rotate each one 90 degrees as if to say ""See? This is how it's done.""  He then ate each one in rapid sucession.

I actually remembered RORY from previous puzzles but I forgot how to spell Alou - I thought ALOO, maybe (possibly because of the proximity of the Indian food clue).

"Here’s a chronological synopsis of the grail in Arthurian literature, beginning in the late 12th century: in Chrétien de Troyes, it is “un graal” (*a* grail) without physical description or explanation. The First Continuator adds a procession in which a hundred grails are carried on each of which is the severed head of a boar. Helinand, abbot of Froidmont, describes a graal as a scutella lata et aliquantulum profunda in qua preciosæ dapes divitibus solent apponi (“a wide and slightly deepened dish on which the wealthy are accustomed to being served costly fare”). Robert de Boron describes the grail as the dish from which Jesus ate lamb at the Last Supper; Joseph of Arimathea uses it to catch his blood as he hangs on the cross. In the Old Welsh Peredur, the grail is a platter bearing a bleeding human head. In his Parzival, Wolfram von Eschenbach describes “the” Grail (der grâl) as a stone with supernatural powers brought down to the earth by the neutral angels — the ones who did not take sides in Lucifer’s rebellion against God. Sir Thomas Malory’s “Sangrail” is covered with a cloth every time it appears, so no one can say what it looks like. Arthurian scholar Roger Sherman Loomis finds in the Grail tradition — if it can be called that — “astonishing disharmony [and] consistent inconsistency.” The OED describes the supposition that the Grail is a cup or chalice as “erroneous.” If you want to call [the/a] grail a goblet, it’s a free country; but there’s no basis for it.",27,neutral,0.8502795696258545
