"At the point in the COVID shutdowns that I realized we were in for the long haul, I bought myself an office chair and a good computer monitor... and a jigsaw puzzle of Starry Night. We had never worked on a jigsaw together before and I hadn't done one in probably 20ish years. Probably shouldn't have gone for the 2,000 piece version!! It did not go well.... üòñ I mean, our relationship was no worse for it‚Äîwe knew we were in it together‚Äîbut it certainly turned us off jigsaws for(possibly) ever.  I still love the painting though! 

This was a tough weekend for me! Yesterday, I was almost so proud of myself because I got about 90% of it myself‚Äîno helps at all‚Äîbut I could not bring it all the way home. It took me so long and so many breaks that I didn't even read the comments... especially because I didn't want to see if it was too easy for a lot of folks.

I got most of the themes quickly, but I didn't recognize GUERNICA or THE PERSISTENCE OF MEMORY.

"Terrific puzzle.  I would have been the perfect person to ""test solve"" it over at the NYT because even though what I don't know about Art History would fill every museum in the country, I knew all the titles.  Not only that -- I could envision all of the paintings in my mind's eye.  

But I didn't know these paintings well enough to count the objects.  Did Michael?

Okay, so I knew that there are two people in AMERICAN GOTHIC and that there is one earring in GIRL WITH A PEAR EARRING.  But the number of orbs?  The number of timepieces?  And most seemingly un-countable of all -- the Basque villagers?

I Googled THE STARRY NIGHT (my first themer in) and tried to count the number of round things in the sky.  But the photo was too small and I wasn't all that sure.  Unless the orange thing in the foreground is also a clock (too blurry online to tell), I could only find three timepieces in THE PERSISTENCE OF MEMORY.  I decided that trying to count the villagers in GUERNICA would probably be out of the question.

Was Michael able to tell by perusing the Internet?  Is there a reference work that gives you this info?  Or did he go in person to every museum and do his counting there?

Whatever he did, this is an interesting and unusual theme with dense fill.  And it actually teaches you something, too.

"Super puzzle! My only regret is that all the artists are white males, and I say this with all due respect, being one myself. To find alternatives by women is extremely hard, however, since the  visual arts were historically so male-dominated that very few female artworks have reached that iconic status that would qualify them for inclusion here. Georgia O'Keeffe's Jimson Weed is hardly well enough known that cluing it as [Two stamens (1936)] would just irritate everyone. Likewise, [Four butterflies and one eyebrow (1940)] would probably not make Frieda Kahlo's ""Self Portrait With Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird"" spring to mind, plus it's 43 letters. Two non-paint artworks, Dorothea Lange's ""Migrant Mother"" (1936) and Judy Chicago's ""Dinner Party"" (1979) with its iconic 39 place settings probably are famous enough to work, but they ain't paint.  Sadly, if you google most famous artworks by women, more than half of the top results are by men. 

Likewise, we all have heard of Basquiat, Jacob Lawrence, Kerry James Marshall, Romare Bearden, and Kara Walker, but how many of us can name a single painting by them that's achieved some status in our collective art consciousness? Mr. Schlossberg was left with limited choices: paintings by us white guys.

I hope I have done my job mansplaining this to you!",50,negative,0.6154136657714844

"How to describe this puzzle‚Äîa rich collection of so much: familiar paintings, hip slang, visits to foreign countries, bits of history, music, astronomy, some TILs and a near-absence of inanity.  However long it took to work this puzzle, it was a pleasure from my clumsy start to plunging into a full hour of hearing Edith sing while I ventured through Peru and once again felt the pleasure of words like ""Oglala Sioux"" in my mouth. There were sly hidden fills and the power of art, from Picasso's shocking images echoing the present, to Grant Wood's stoic couple on their Iowa farm.  I loved this puzzle and l am hoping another that will offer as much.

Thank you, Michael Schlossberg.",44,positive,0.9352591037750244

"Referent to the constructor‚Äôs notes:

At the Dali Museum in St Petersburg (FL) is exhibited - along with The Persistence of Memory - ‚ÄòLincoln in DaliVision‚Äô, built of a few dozen large pixels which look like nothing up close but at a distance of 20 meters (down the corridor) resolve into the face of Lincoln from the five-dollar bill.

A fun place, a nice visit. The building itself includes huge windows made up of hundreds of triangular panes - no two of which, it is said, are the same shape and dimensions. A rather firm rejection of manufacture via interchangeable parts.",5,neutral,0.7980033755302429

"Very satisfying! I don‚Äôt want to call it easy, but almost all the clues clicked well for me. I made really good time on this one. I appreciate the paintings chosen for the theme - evocative, well-known, and timeless. My one challenge here was YENTA crossing with TARTT. Never would have guessed (until I did). 

It‚Äôs especially nice to have The Starry Night as one of the answers, as just this year I heard the Don McLean song Vincent for the first time and have been loving it. What a great tribute to Van Gogh",12,positive,0.9840559959411621
