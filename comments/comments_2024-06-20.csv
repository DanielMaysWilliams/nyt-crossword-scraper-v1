"Condolences to the non Americans attempting to solve this puzzle. I’ve tried a few Brit cryptics and although I lived in London for a year long ago the cultural references are too much for me. (I miss the New Yorker cryptics). I was waaaay over average on solving time here. Really great Thursday puzzle!  More please, less rebuses",9,positive,0.6520181894302368
