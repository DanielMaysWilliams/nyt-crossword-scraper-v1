"Good toothy toothsome crunchy puzzle, for me almost Sat level but very enjoyable. I thought I'd give up my streak (& feel less guilty about Sun when I googled a bit to get unWEDGEd) but kept at it‚Ä¶ a real ""aha!"" on (15th glance at) clue to 9D TWISTER, ran letters & saw the S ‚Äî OMG TWISTER! I certainly played some Twister as a kid at home & at parties. Still didn't quite get the home run tho, didn't know Sarah song title, was sure only of 12D IGOR. Kept trying stuff at 20A. ANHEIRANDASABRE? I thought ""11D, A LIE! Sure! But WELGE? How 'bout AFIB. What's a WEfGE? Went like this for about 24 hrs (felt like it anyway), never heard of a WEDGE issue but at least it's a word, FINALLY 10D broke open from PETASY CHIC (had that forever) (before that it was cuTeSY CHIC. No idea how that's a 'medium' for animals, maybe a genre? Style? Pet-owner indulgence? No clue) when suddenly ZAMbo I saw P‚û°PETPSYCHIC and suddenly MEDIUM made sense!

I only know THEYIPS from the crosswords!

Was only gonna write a short comment this time but here we are!

Anyway, I really liked the uniqueness & flavor of so much of the fill. I too liked GASSTATIONSUSHI, grinned at THISISANOUTRAGE. I think DEADTREEEDITION was the 1st spanner I got but not right off. All good.

Very solid, eclectic and witty puzzle. And his debut yet! My guess is Eli's gonna RISE & them's no LIES!  What a nice Friday TWISTER! INIT tho? AMEN! Put that in your PIPE & smoke it! HEPA HEPA Hooray! (I'm very hungry, please forgive this blather)",1,positive,0.8545993566513062

First, I must admit that, despite my idiocy (can't wrap it in pretty paper, it is what it is), I got through it pretty fast for a Friday, for me. Those of you who took longer, please don't be annoyed with me; I usually have to use the ""easy version"" to help me through, but today I didn't, and I really enjoyed it.

But I spent way too much time trying to figure out the theme...until, finally, I had the proverbial head-smack. It's Friday! No theme today!

"Happy day!

I completed my 124th daily solve, my 17th Friday puzzle (not counting some archive practice) with ZERO lookups! And 20mins faster than my average, so the usually-infernal app statistics inform me.

I can manage Mondays, many Tuesdays, and some Wednesdays and Thursdays, without the assistance of Sir Google of Instantaneous Information, but it's never happened before on the ""hard"" days.

I feel that if I scroll through comments, I'll confirm my suspicion that today's was a softer, friendlier Friday, so I shan't let it go to my head. But still, I started off with only a couple gimmes (for the French clues) and a couple seemingly okay guesses (same as Deb with _AI for half a rum drink); my fill was pretty sparse after my first across and down passes. Seemed like I was in store for another taxing Friday... Yet I did not succumb to the siren call of the search engine to seek the WNBA star, the rapper, or the morning sunshine drink!

I bounced around the grid for a bit and slowly (or I guess not that slowly?) things came together. GAS STATION SUSHI was a big breakthrough (it helps that my husband's truly unfortunate choice of roadtrip snacks is a long-cherished source of teasing). And while, initially, I couldn't remember Pip's love interest or Syd's surname or how the Risk map labels that part of Russia, they bubbled up with a couple letters. ELENA was the best name that fit E__NA, some part of my brain recognized T-PAIN, and ASAHI came from the crosses.",9,positive,0.9037225246429443

"I flew through this‚Ä¶but came to a grinding halt at the song and pet medium cross. Never saw PET PSYCHIC coming, even though I once had a pet reiki practitioner sent by a thoughtful friend after suddenly, unexpectedly losing one of a bonded pair of dogs. She told us that our surviving pup thought we should place her brother‚Äôs ashes under his favorite shade tree and taught us a soothing spinal massage for our old gal. Whether real or not, we felt some comfort from it.

Got a good laugh from GAS STATION SUSHI ü§¢! I don‚Äôt think one needs to be a PSYCHIC to predict the complications possible from its consumption. I once wisely shunned a plateful of uniced slimy-looking shrimp at a book club evening‚Ä¶Others were not so astute‚Ä¶

"Great debut! Contrary to some comments I'm seeing, TPAIN was the first clue I got... highly recommend watching his appearance on NPR's Tiny Desk Concert.

The longer I continue this lifelong hobby, the better I get at it--except for the references above, which have been causing my confidence to erode. Dickens in 42A? No problemo.

Otherwise I thought this puzzle was terrific and original. Gas station sushi made me LOL.",11,neutral,0.5316640138626099
"A brilliant, really cracking debut! While the northeast corner was tough (the clue for 3D might have specified beer rather than beverage, but I get it, Jake, it's Fridaytown), as the long entries DEADTREEEDDITION and ANHEIRANDASPARE took shape, both 2D and 3D could be worked out with the other crossings. 

PETPSYCHIC was fabulous. And Syd BARRETT has been on my mind lately because I'm somewhere around episode 157 of Andrew Hickey's marathon podcast A History of Rock in 500 songs, which just covered the birth of Pink Floyd, and the particular sadness of Barrett's disapperance from public life at age 26 after leaving the band. Indications are that he was quite a bit along the Asperger's-Autistic spectrum, and the self-medication and heavy experimentation with psychedelics certainly wasn't helpful in his case.

And the double stacked GASSTATIONSUSHI, combined with THISISANOUTRAGE, was just genius. Eli Cotham, I think you have a bright future. You're a natural, not to detract from the hard work that goes into these efforts. Proper respect to you sir!",12,positive,0.7359511256217957

There are PET PSYCHICS now?  What do they do, exactly?  Read your pet's paw?  Warn you ahead of time that your dog is about to chew up your entire closet of shoes?  I assume they don't come cheap -- that they're more expensive than, say, dog walkers, dog groomers, or vets.

As for the long stacked answers -- no one can say they're not colorful. DEAD TREE EDITION and AN HEIR AND A SPARE are great. THIS IS AN OUTRAGE is a memorable expression and one I've used often.  On the other hand, AHOK and OHGEE are neither great nor memorable.

Perhaps my problems stemmed from the fact that I started the puzzle around midnight after watching the 76ers bow  out of the playoffs in excruciating fashion, by coming up just a little short in the final minute of the game.  Props to the Knicks and their trio of former Villanovans, especially Jalen Brunson.  So perhaps the lateness of the hour and my disappointment affected my focus.

It helped that I knew Syd BARRETT, ADIA, and that I knew of TPAIN  and could spot him with a couple of crosses. But the spanners came to me very slowly, and I struggled in the SE corner, perhaps becauseI tried yips for 60A, instead of LIES (clever misdirection that).   Because I did so, I hesitated to try it for 25A (perhaps I had the puzzle yips).",14,negative,0.45750343799591064

"Might be time for me to return to my home planet. Really surprised to see that so many found this one unusually easy for a Friday. For me - quite a struggle and besides my usual googles, I actually flat-out cheated on a couple of answers (looked up the NYT answer), notably GASSTATIONSUSHI. Never, ever heard of that and was surprised to see that it was familiar to most everyone else. 

Was still surprised to finish successfully. Really shouldn't count this one, but no big deal. I'm sure I'll bomb on tomorrow's puzzle. 

Quite remarkable puzzle find today. I'll put that in a reply.

"Coincidence of the day:

When I print my daily puzzle, I use old header and trailer paper that my husband collected from work before retiring, as well as the backs of bills and other paper received that is only printed on one side.  Todays puzzle was printed on the back side of a request from the ACLU to update my charge card information.  Filling in 15A could not have been easier! 

In spite of being straightforward for a Friday, I really enjoyed a lot of the fill today.  GAS STATION SUSHI, DEAD TREE EDITION, VALISES, VAMOOSES, THE YIPS -  all fun stuff to fill in.  AN HEIR AND A SPARE was unknown to me.  I much prefer Eli's original clue: ""Two Princes?"".  It would have been funnier when I got it.

"Ahh, the ooze of raw flesh slowly slithering over each other (gas station sushi & tartare). Giant Eagle, the local grocery chain, has their own gas stations, too, called Get-Gos. Their ""food stations"" have semi-fresh sushi and I'm still alive to tell you about it, and say, yeah, it's not a bad lunch. Especially the ahi & asparagus with ethanol. Most selections come either regular or unleaded and the diesel wasabi is super hot -- and the more you buy the more ""fuel perks"" you get, which, while of no help to our world, can earn you a free tank of gas once in a blue moon.

Having just read in Politico that Kristi Noem's chances at VP -- or anything, really -- nosedived after she wrote about her puppy, Cricket, the cute downward dog photo in the Worldplay column, plus ""pet psychic"" started me musing about how, sometime in the not too distant future, one nite Kristi will hear ""the yips"" again in her sleep, there in her dacha in the Urals that Putin gifted her. Cricket! Nite after nite she hears him, baying and yipping joyously. Desperately, she journeys to Vladivostok where the notorious pet psychic Madam Big D. resides. D. shakes her head sadly. ""Madam, no matter how much you beg, your pleas will not be answered. There are no avenues for you to take; you can race, you can --"" she snaps her fingers -- ""vamoose even...but you will never escape the yips, not even if you gave everything you had to the ACLU...""
