"@Eric Hougland 

If you see this, I'm curious about a comment you made in the puzzle from March 8, 2023, which I did this morning. 

The theme was concerning guacamole. You made a comment that you make it with a bit of salsa and then just pour the lime on top and let it pool, then pour it off.

I get letting it pool to avoid discoloration but was curious why you pour it off instead of mixing it in?  Perhaps you or your husband simply don't like the flavor, but I'm such a guac lover that I wondered if there was a more culinary reason for it. Weird and randomish question, I know. üòä

"Nice, for once, to have a Monday puzzle that was something of a challenge to solve, and a pleasant challenge at that. Although I correctly entered 48D, I had Oliver North confused with Oliver Stone, so the connection to the theme at first made no sense. Both Olivers, as it happens, are associated with late 20th-century conspiracies, real or imagined (North for his role in Iran-Contra, Stone as screenwriter and director of ‚ÄúJFK‚Äú). There used to be a professor of ancient and modern languages at Urbana-Champaign with the palindromic name REVILO Oliver. One of my college pals did graduate work with him. When he wasn‚Äôt parsing Vedic sutras, Oliver was busy purveying exotic conspiracy theories, most having to do with an ethno-religious group plotting to rule the world. Eventually, Oliver‚Äôs notions proved too extreme even for the Birch Society, and he died a lonely man. Think of all the fun he‚Äôd be having today.",1,positive,0.716821551322937

"I know it‚Äôs April Fools, but I continue to be frustrated by the frequency of puzzles that are not dyslexic-friendly. People with dyslexia make up a significantly higher percentage of the population than many people assume.

"A crunchy Monday! I hope it lures newer solvers into some new territory. The cluing made it accessible, if the theme made flyspecking tricky. I had MOMMa, and never read the clue for STY in the SE corner until I finished to resounding silence. 

Nice job!",12,positive,0.8954986929893494

"Constructors never cease to amaze me, and this was no exception. A fun, unusual yet accessible Monday twist for April Fool‚Äôs Day. Nice work, Alan!

But today my heart belongs to Sam for her parenthetical commentary on the ‚Äúpost-truth era‚Äù. Thanks, Sam! Your columns always offer varying degrees of encouragement, wisdom, humor, and perspective. A great place to land after solving.",43,positive,0.976693332195282

"As other commenters have said, this seemed mid-week rather than Monday. Unlike them, I don‚Äôt attribute it to April Fool‚Äôs Day, but rather as part of a pattern since Will went on medical leave and Joel took over.

I like Monday and Tuesday puzzles to make me smile on my way out the door (or on my way to bed, depending on when I do them), and I want Wednesday and Thursday ones to make me sweat and feel accomplished if I solve them without the column. For the last few weeks I‚Äôve just felt disgruntled every time I finish, except on Sundays (go figure).

"A gentle Thursday on a Monday, courtesy of it being April 1st. Found myself skipping the italicized clues for the horizontal crosses until I cottoned onto the tricks.

Quite clever, Alan, and thanks!",42,positive,0.9408271908760071

I didn‚Äôt notice the rest of the inverted answers (until I read Sam‚Äôs column), because I got all the crossing clues for them.  Nor did I twig to the fact that all of the ‚Äúfun‚Äù clues were italicized, with each offering it‚Äôs own hint.

"Thing is, when my Yugo breaks down, I often say, ""Ach, she's gone gnitca again.""

And anyone knows that ""Niatnuom"" in Yeti means, literally, ""Euro-Litter"" but linguists are divided whether this refers to all the junk the alpinists leave behind or the alpinists themselves. Also, people who know me from the Reagan era know that I called Oliver North ""Dr. Revilo"" because we reviled him so much. The way he tried to spin his revival, even though he's the sort of minor demon in the outskirts of some Dantesque inferno* was more shameless than Werner Herzog on a volcanic island interviewing the stalwarts.
