"This was reasonably doable for a foreigner, for a Saturday puzzle, except the center N and NW bit - that was one giant natick for this Polish guy.

INCOGMEATO may be a cute name but I've never heard of it before, and it crossed with answers to clues that were also a total mystery to me. I have just looked up MCATS (seriously though, do all Americans know the acronyms of all those exams, or is it just a crossword thing? In Poland nobody knows stuff like that, excepts those directly involved), but I still don't know what OGS are - such short words are not easy to Google. Could somebody please explain that to me?

I am sometimes able to enter BART into a puzzle, when it is simply clued. I learned that acronym from these puzzles. However, not knowing Embarcadero, I was stumped today by the clue. I actually visited SF but I don't remember all the names of all of the places there.

And finally, I would appreciate an explanation of It's not often seen on a diamond: NOHITTER. Is that some baseball thing?",11,neutral,0.509954571723938

""Nose"" before PORE

Of course, none of the downs made sense with those, so I emptied that section and started over. The clue for CISCO helped me get that one correct, but I resorted to Google to finish the puzzle.

"Took my time with this one, thinking, as I slowly sowed words in the fertile rows of this puzzle, and not for the first time, how themeless puzzles provide more of an insight into the minds & psyches of the constructors, than themed puzzles, which provide cover, in a way, for the puzzlemaker to keep our attention fixed on the puzzle & not the Wizard of Oz. And when there are two constructors, who can tell which words are whose?

But I really enjoyed this grid for its -- ironically -- off-the-grid ethos. At either end: compost bin & spare parts. Likewise, Incogmeato balances nicely with To be honest: going off the grid means losing one's online ID; going incognito, to be honest. Hiding one's identity. Living a barebones life in the Alberta styx, under a roof whose eaves you've thatched with straw, short and long. Doing a star search in the night sky to determine by the angle of constellations when it is, now or then...and waiting for the last hard apples to ripen, so you can bat them into a hash and make an acrid cider of it.

"Filled in rotorooter at 1A thinking of rototiller. (Yes, DUH was Friday’s puzzle but there it is.) The company at 1D could wait, I figured, ONTAP was obvious, some exams for science majors have known to be Traps, could a strip clean an Ogre? Not sure but I was willing to find out. Then it all stopped working so well.

Moved over to the SE, where it started solving like a midweek puzzle but, eventually, I wended my way back to my rotorooter, of which, unaccountably, I’d as lief let go as a firstborn. Oof. Spent some time on that corner. 3 decades of a vegetarian diet, yet INCOGMEATO and I had never crossed paths. I guess it doesn’t come in a can. And it sounds like it might taste as meat. 

The COMPOST BIN resisted me for a bit, too. I wanted COMPOST bag. Tried composting once, I did. Filled a bowl with parings for a week while I waited for the weekend do we could go buy a COMPOST BIN. The weekend came; we got busy. So I kept adding parings and peelings and corings and pittings as I waited for another weekend to come. (Okay, fine, it was mostly coffee grounds. But some veggie parts went in, too.)

Then, one misty PNW morning, I came down to the kitchen and— the contents of my proto-compost bowl had come alive. Grown new parts.  Definitely legs. Possibly teeth. Shrieking, I ran for my husband and (he says, unprovably) locked myself in the bathroom till he took the… the… creature outside and… and sent it away to live with a nice family on a farm.

"This one went quite fast for me, despite some wrong guesses, like ""rototiller"" for the gardener's item that breaks down a lot, which wound up being COMPOST BIN...so it wasn't the actual lot being broken down, and on a Saturday, no less.  I also put ""mash"" for HASH, and then had to figure out why MATE WATCH was disdainful.  

I also had never heard of INCOGMEATO, but it was inferrable.   And speaking of meat...

Although the clue is technically correct in saying that the BACONATOR is a non-kosher Wendy's offering, I'll point out (on a Saturday, no less) that nothing Wendy's offers is kosher.  Although there are several kosher McDonald's in Israel, none of the national fast food chains in the US offers any kind of kosher food.  The BACONATOR isn't kosher because, obviously, it's made with bacon, but also because it's made with meat and cheese together, it's made with non-kosher products in general, and it's made in a non-kosher environment.  If it met all the other requirements, it would be non-kosher if it failed to meet one of them.",22,neutral,0.5433162450790405
