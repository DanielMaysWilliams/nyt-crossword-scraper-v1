"Many people skip the Monday puzzle because it's too easy for their tastes; consequently they miss the Monday comments as well.

A loss on both counts, IMO.  Yes, the puzzle goes fast, especially if you're an experienced solver, but so often it's a marvelous brush with wit.

And the comments!  Two examples from today.
* Rich in Atlanta's explanation of why this puzzle's theme is so tight, elucidating the skill that went into making it, and 
* John Ezra's Moby Dick spin drawn from the puzzle.  You are cheating yourself of an incredible brush with wit and humor if you pass this up!",12,negative,0.5016379356384277

I don't use my phone to pay for stuff and I don't know how to use my phone to pay for stuff and I don't want to know how to use my phone to pay for stuff.  ""Can you please bring me a check?"" is my reply to the peculiar squiggles.  I didn't know it was a QR CODE and I have no idea what the QR stands for.

There is no question in my mind that the ubiquitous IPhone will be the downfall of our entire civilization.  Maybe everyone should just have one implanted in their skull and be done with it.

"As threatened below - First search today was for 15 letter answers that contain the Q...R... sequence. Well - there are 30 that have appeared in NYT puzzles - but... 11 of those fit that pattern because they begin with QuaRter.

...even in the Xword Info extended list (answers that have never been in a puzzle), the only other answer I could find that fits that pattern was: QUIETREVOLUTION

It was Monopoly dog eat dog that dark night. No hat or wheelbarrow were safe. Nothing was held sacred. 

We almost didn't make it out but that we vowed then and there to destroy the game and never play again.  A vow we have kept lo these many years having sent that game straight to the abyss from whence it came. We can only pray it is still there.
