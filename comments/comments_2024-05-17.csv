"Clever clue-ing indeed.  Thanks Hemant!  Good fun!  

Need to start with CTRLALTDEL as a 3-fingered salute, c‚Äômon now.  It‚Äôs usually not a good sign when you have to resort to this command, but now I will smile a bit when I remember this clue. 

Love how puzzle is themeless to us, but on theme to you.  As a fan of NBA basketball and GBBO, could apply to me too.  Tho I only got CAGER after reading Wordplay.  Easily got NIKES tho! 

Favourites : FEUDS, BAKE, I DO, SNIDE REMARKS, SCIENCE LAB

I answer puzzles in order, generally start with Across but sometimes Downs.  I don‚Äôt mind looking up clues, especially since I don‚Äôt live in NY or even US.  Some clues are very local.  Always learn something new tho.  Thank you all who make this happen!",0,positive,0.93586266040802

"I really enjoyed this puzzle! It was a good one for me to jump back into after not being able to finish the last few. I should say, it's not that I couldn't finish them (I still will), just that there were many travel distractions. Our trip home from Honduras went from what was supposed to be a 12 hour trip to a 35 hour one with an extra hotel stay. Plus, the most turbulent ferry ride I've ever had from our island to the mainland. You'd think all the delays would have helped me finish the puzzles, but my head wasn't there. Plus, it's a lot to travel internationally under normal circumstances with my dear MIL, who is pretty advanced in years and dementia, but with all the delays and confusion of this one, it was pretty rough. She had a great time while there, though, so 'twas worth our exhaustion!  

Anyhow, puzzle! This was a lovely one for me. Fun to puzzle out but breezy and well under average. Favorite answers: SCIENCE LAB (student mixers), and FELL IN LOVE (smitten), HOPE (Pandora's box), FEUDS (long rows), GOD, I'M ON A DIET!!! (just kidding but I liked the stacked placement of GO DIM and the thought of yelling GOD, I'M ON A DIET! if someone is too desert pushy), BAKES (get a rise), and CHEESE WEDGE (cursor shaped food). So, obviously, I liked a lot. üòä

"Another vote from me for themeless Wednesday.  That would give a home to perfectly good puzzles like this one. With that change, the community would be able to focus on the puzzle itself instead of the day of the week.  It's not fair to the constructor, who I imagine might come here to see what people thought of their puzzle, to see comment after comment about an editorial decision.",13,neutral,0.4553299844264984
"Not quite a personal best but close. Yes, it was easy for a Friday but so what? It was an enjoyable jaunt, with interesting fill, I saw little glue. 
The only clue i had to work at was IDOLS, having no clue what Survivor is, other than I presume a tv show? I tried tools first, but that clearly didn‚Äôt work with NOSE. Ditto who we‚Äôre talking about at 45D. Didn‚Äôt halt me for long though, being confident with my answers to 22 and 46D. 
It works for me that it‚Äôs a fast solve today, I‚Äôve got a packed day ahead with guests arriving later, so a cake and casserole to prep.",11,positive,0.8154396414756775
"Well, at least I found the puzzle easier than usual for a Friday,  but didn‚Äôt expect quite such a chorus of disappointment that it was too easy to be enjoyed at all.   As always I wonder what day the instructor had in mind.    I liked it a lot.",13,positive,0.9281979203224182

"Hi Deb!  Monday-Wednesday I start from 1A and move through methodically.  Thursdays I try and find the revealer section first.  Fridays and Saturdays I start from 1A but I deviate when I'm in a roll in a particular area and I branch out from there.  

Sundays I'm all over the place.  I find Sundays a bit tedious but I can't not do them lol!

Today I started in at 1A and then just went methodically through to the end.  I was actually disappointed when I got the music so quickly.  It was a very lovely Wednesday puzzle though! :)",6,neutral,0.6172897219657898

"Regarding the relative ease of this one here is my take:

1. It‚Äôs a great puzzle. Nice job!
2. The easiest clues are on the level of a Monday or Tuesday.
3. If I imagine the harder clues in a Mon or Tue that seems too hard. I‚Äôd even say they‚Äôre almost too hard for a Wed.
4. That leaves Thu, so maybe it‚Äô 1 day off in terms of level.",4,positive,0.7141172885894775

"If I was one of those ""sophisticated"" mice with a phony British accent, plump from cheese wedges at various art openings, fundraisers, and CMA awards parties, I would refuse the canap√©s. ""Dahling,"" I'd squeak, ""Cahn't you see I'm on a diet? I'd like to lose tan grams."" 

And if I was a Navy cadet, I'd take my shore leave in San Francisco, take a cable car up near the Mark Hopkins, avoiding the tidal wave of tourists along the Embarcadero, and, because you have a nose for wine, order a glass of a good French cru at the Top of the Mark. 

If I was Adele I wouldn't be losing sleep over snide remarks. It's just those scamps in science lab who fell in love with you and have posters of you in HD taped to their dormroom doors, the one of you in a kilt in Oslo, showing your delts as you lift your hands up, holding that high C note impossibly long. Those boys need a proctor to tell 'em what to erase. We all grow up. When I was Twenty One I would cram for tests the night before, barely eked out a degree. And now I'm the type who reads ahead. 

*For mice, of course, the CMAs stand for the Country Mouse Association awards. They're in a FEUD with another group called the CMA -- the City Mouse Association, which also gives out awards. One day the country mice and the city mice will get along, but right now there are a lot of wedge issues.",42,neutral,0.5036640763282776

There was nothing *that* terrible - I‚Äôve never seen Survivor, don‚Äôt care about the CMAs or ADELE‚Äôs music that much, but that‚Äôs just my contrarian tastes I guess.  But there was no clever world play here, nothing to think about, no ‚Äúa-ha‚Äù moments.  Another letdown after a weak Thursday.",6,negative,0.8865198493003845

"I finished this puzzle very close to my PB time with nary a hint nor a lookup, but I am not disappointed that it was too easy for the following reasons:

It was full of unusual and interesting fill.

Plenty of clever and misdirecting clues (the one for INHD being a favourite)

I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of solving.

Even the crossing of two unknown proper names didn't phase me today, as I was able to easily guess the correct letters.

In conclusion- one of the best straightforward, seamless themeless Friday crosswords ever! (imho)",61,positive,0.9629802107810974

"The Fawdon Wagonway was an English cable car system that started operation in 1826. Another was inaugurated in East London in 1840. The West Side and Yonkers Patent Railway started in New York in 1868, five years before cable cars started running in San Francisco. The grip used in San Francisco cable cars was an innovation in 1873, but the cable car itself was nearly a half-century old at the time. I thought my father was cool for commuting to work on SF's Clay Street cable car line, but in later years he and Stepmother #4 made Tony Bennett's ILMHISF ""our song"" and I cringed whenever they played it.",22,neutral,0.8402590155601501

After a bit of a search I found the problem at 43A where I thought wake was a good way to get a rise, and hadn‚Äôt paid any attention to 43D, which in my version was walds. Time to run the alphabet and luckily my first choice was B, which gave me BAKE and BALDS and the coveted gold star. Well, not every thing you BAKE rises, but ok, that‚Äôs in bounds.  However, is BALDS a proper usage?  Even with that snag this one was over too soon.",5,neutral,0.6081122756004333
