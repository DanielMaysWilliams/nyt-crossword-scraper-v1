So here is how a SELLATHON works: Car prices are increased by some amount and then advertised as less than that amount as a discount.

"I liked this puzzle, and I can easily imagine the theme, twisted a little bit, working on a tricksy Thursday.

Sam, as a Canadian, you may be excused from not knowing the ""Sooner State""--formerly ""Indian* Territory"", home to peoples forcibly removed from their ancestral homelands (The Indian Removal Act) and relocated (The Trail of Tears), with no regard to their widely divergant cultures, tradtions, and histories, and smushed onto a relatively small tract of land (which already had peoples living there)--a tract of land which no Euro-americans wanted, until they did (50 years later). At which point the Federal government renegged on even that policy, and ""gifted"" it to said Euro-american would-be settlers, some of whom (the ""sooners"") opened their gifts the night before, as it were.

Perhaps the Second Great American Sin (I'll leave you all to figure out what the first was); and one for which no current Oklahomans should be burdened with.

Of course, the clue was actually about Texas, a state with its own troubled history.

*There is no good term--they're obviously not from India, nor, as a rule, savage; but, having been born here, I am just as an indigenous, native American as any. Perhaps Canadians come closest with their term ""First Nations"".

These two things alone brought a big thumbs up, but then there was an additional gift to my brain, which relishes work. Such as in the NW for me, where I had confidently slapped in ECO for EPA, LITHE for ON TOE, and HONOR for OSCAR.  That provided a lovely tangle for my brain to deal with.

"Please allow me to dive into this opportunity to point out the incessant use of  double negatives as positives!  Note examples like ""Don't forget"" instead of ""Remember"" and ""Don't leave"" which implores ""Stay."" Could part of our cultural negativity bias be attributed to our focus on what we don't want as a way of stating our intent? ""Don't drop it,"" really means ""Hold on tight,"" and ""Don't lose it"" means ""Put it in a safe place."" Imagine what would change if we use our language intentionally instead of as a way of stating what we fear? Perhaps we will use words to declare and manifest the positive. 
As a fairly new solver, I do reveal letters and words instead of persevering and remaining determined.  The annoying double negative ""Never give up"" would leave many of my puzzles incomplete, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn something new.
