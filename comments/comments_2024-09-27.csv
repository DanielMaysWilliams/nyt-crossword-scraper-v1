"(This was originally slated as a reply to someone's complaint about ALEKEG, but I thought I give it its own thread.)

I'll say this again (and probably again and again).  Pretty much every day there is a crossword answer I've never heard of, but am able to fill it in either because the answer has a shred of reasonableness (such as ALEKEG) or it just seems to be the most likely answer given all the pieces of the puzzle.  At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter if this crossword is the only place this specific string of letters has ever been in print.  Just accept that you have never heard of it, and that whether or not it is in use somewhere is immaterial.  Sure would cut down on a lot of comments.",3,neutral,0.7180078625679016

Brown BASMATI rice is a household staple here.  It is also helpful in solving crosswords.

You lost by a whisker -- three queens to three kings?  I don't play poker, but I sort of have the feeling that this may be a made-up phrase that nobody says.

Not a good idea to put questionable or controversial fill at 1A.  Other than that, though, I found this an enjoyable puzzle.  It seemed fairly easy for a Friday -- except for the places that weren't.  I made my grid very messy by filling in two answers in very dark ink that were wrong:  ON AUTOmatic before ON AUTOPILOT and, spurred on by the initial ""Y"", I had YES AND NO instead of YOUR CALL for ""I could go either way on that"".

I liked the clues for VICTORY LAPS and SEA LEGS.  But many clues seemed quite easy for a Friday -- CHOPIN in particular.  I very much appreciated the lack of names and the very clean grid.  And will I EVER learn to spell ATTILA?  I knew him early on, but waited to write him in until I could confirm the spelling.  I'm a really good speller, but this is a blind spot.

CHOPIN was a gimme, obviously. Btw, I'm not a fan of the name, for this particular airport. It is located in the Okęcie district of Warsaw, and it is one of the oldest airports in this country - it is not only an important transport hub but also a piece of Polish history. It was simply known as ""Okęcie"" for decades. Then in the 1990s for promotional reasons it was renamed. Can you imagine renaming your oldest US airport, College Park?. The managers wanted a name easier to pronounce and remember for foreigners. There was also a nationalist motive: Chopin was French-Polish. Many Polish people suffer from an inferiority complex vis-a-vis other European nations, and can't bear thinking of sharing Polish icons with others. Making Chopin patron of *Poland's* busiest airport was supposed to show there was more Polish in him than French. (In a similar vein, a politician of the 2015-2023 ruling populist party publicly claimed in 2016 that sophisticated Polish people taught the disgusting, uncouth French how to use forks in the 16th century...).",24,neutral,0.4389932453632355

So he bets everything he has and before you know it, tears of blood are streaming down his cheeks and James Bond is wearing a quiet, almost rueful smile, as if the Vesper he was sipping had suddenly grown rather zesty, to die for, even... ""Hone in"" is what you tell your barber to do for your ducktail, or your fade, or whatever kind of cut you have in mind. So ""H"" works, yeah?

That's my excuse, O people of Ezramania, may you find it within your hearts to grant me another opportunity to win tomorrow; I promise you victory laps, and I will answer every chant of ""Go Team Go!"" with a ""Let's Roll!"" and my heart will beat a seism that would a zillionaire's ego into a zillion pieces, some bone-in, others not so much, like Attila the Hun put through a dicer, probably untested for such uses. ""Are you in all the way?"" I will ask, as I watch the dicer CHOP IN two the zillionaire's little sea legs, and yes, people of Ezralandia, with gusto I will win gold. I won't forget: it's on my to-do list.",22,neutral,0.5046340823173523
"No complaints. This puzzle was mEaTY as I struggled with it and, finally, ZESTY when I got it solved.

I’ve never heard of Q DOBA in my life. East Coast thing? Mid West? 

And, are we sure [Who’s cutting onions?] should get the question mark treatment? DICER seems like an extremely literal answer. Not a punny one. I suppose, because the phrase seldom used literally, the literal answer becomes the pun?

Great puzzle. Thanks a bunch, Jake Bunch",26,positive,0.7741209268569946

"I liked it.  :)  Pretty smooth and enjoyable to solve.  One-across turned out to be the last fill, which makes me a little unhappy; I'd never heard the phrase.  On the other end, literally, ""good standing in the Navy"" was probably the best clue.

I read Wordplay and the constructor comments, looked back at the grid, and still don't see anything remarkable about it?  ""Isolated squares""?  Whatever, man.  Nice puzzle regardless.

"This puzzle was my 1,000th Gold Star for my streak. I really enjoyed it 🥹

I invited my friends over and we all worked on it together. I am so grateful for crossword puzzles for fostering connection, I love asking people for help on clues that play to their particular niche. I have learned so much from the smart and passionate people in my life, and I am happy to have found a way to make this usually solitary hobby a social one. 

Thanks for all the puns, the word play, and the learning. I’m so incredibly grateful for the distinctly human urge to make and solve puzzles. I’m looking forward to 1,000 more 🤍🖤",110,positive,0.9881997108459473
