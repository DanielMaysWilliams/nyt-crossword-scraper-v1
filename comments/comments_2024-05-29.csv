"So late to the party this evening, but--since I noticed all the theme entries were alcoholic drinks--may I offer a little dessert?

Julia Child has a recipe which I have never prepared, but will someday. It's a variation on Baked Alaska, with the cake and ice cream formed into a somewhat conical shape. Frosted with meringue, of course--good reason to use that Oxo offset spatula--but at the ""summit"" she embeds half a shell of one of the eggs, cup side up. Just before serving, the egg-shell is filled with warm cognac or liqueur, and ignited. Preferably, the burning cognac will run down the sides like molten lava.

Julia called it ""la Surprise de Vesuve.""

"My apologies to everyone who replied to my comment re: tombolos yesterday. It's been glorious weather here (although there was rain yesterday morning) and I just don't get back to the comments when the outdoors and my garage workshop are calling. 

JohnMW: thanks! I do aim to please. That expression goes back decades and, after the Magnuson act came into effect, it was adopted by the fishing industry in their efforts to blame all fishing problems on the feds. 

Caroline Kearney: I was specifically referring to Bar Island in Bar Harbor -- the island that gives the town its name. If you go to the town pier and look straight north, you will be staring at Bar Island and its tombolo. It is a much longer tombolo than the one at Barred Island in Deer Isle. I used to live on the Blue Hill peninsula so I know Deer Isle fairly well. (How about that bridge!)

Hardroch and JayTee: Yes, tombolos are fairly common, including here in Maine. The one I referred to in my OP was the one connecting Salt Island to Good Harbor Beach in Gloucester, MA. I wasn't aware of the one in Sorrento, but it looks like it's not publicly accessible so I may never visit it.

"Didn't know what dark corner of the wine cellar Josh Duhamel was hiding in, but for once my brain's little flashlight briefly flickered and there he was with his sanded-down DiCaprio features!

It's rye-ly amusing to me that when I came across the recipe that turned out to be for MUDSLIDE I literally said to myself, ""That's a recipe for disaster."" And the others were the same, just the thing that would bypass whatever euphoria alcohol produces and head straight for the worst hangover ever. All ROADS lead to RUIN in this puzzle.

Props on the badminton clue. Here I was thinking golf.
