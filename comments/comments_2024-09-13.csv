As soon as I saw that Deb Amlen had linked to a 2003 puzzle I went to the archives and solved that one as well. However, just from her comment about it I already knew a bit more about it than I would have liked. 

I would like to suggest that the NYTimes adopt as policy putting a warning at the very top of any column which references puzzles in the archives--something along the lines of ""Today's column contains possible spoilers for the following archival puzzle:"" followed by the link. It's actually great to have the context of those older puzzles, to understand a new twist on an old trick; I'd just prefer the chance to discover the trick for myself before reading about it.",5,positive,0.8559657335281372

Pastor? I knew it wouldn't just be pastor, but I couldn't think of the peon or serf word it should be and messed up the NW corner.

The rest of the puzzle was a pleasure to work, and that NW corner did fill up when the pastor became a VASSAL (don't ask me how that worked).  I felt a delicious little frisson of joy when it was done, and congratulated myself on a brilliant performance.

I mean what do I know, I haven't had one since they made me violently ill in the second grade... while on the bus coming home from school. I'll tell you what, that's a character builder!

It has never been popular over here, and these days recycled paper is used to stuff boxes, anyway, for environmental reasons.

I've been thinking about dog noises, after yesterday's puzzle. Some empirical trials may have been involved, too. So, yeah, labs do woofs, yorkies do arfs, and beagles do bow wows.

"Wonderful puzzle, devilishly clued.  And the marquee clue/answer for my money -- quite literally speaking! -- is SIX FIGURES.  Ah, yes -- especially if you live in NYC.  Never mind that it took you decades and decades to reach a grand old age of (well-beyond) Medicare eligibility.  The only internists accepting new patients now are ""concierge doctors"" and what are their ""concierge fees""?  You really don't want to know.

This is definitely a ""Nancy puzzle"".  Very few little bits of arcane trivia knowledge required and instead unusual and twisty clues to figure out.  Some of my other favorites today:  ABS (1A);  BRAND NAME (2D);  CITATION NEEDED (43A); EMU (33A); ACTION POSE (50A); ERAS (25D).

One write-over:  SHoRe up before SHARPEN for ""improve as an argument"".

"Boaz has shown in this debut that he has the chops.  The grid is clean.  The two marquee spanners – DON’T ANSWER THAT and CITATION NEEDED – are terrific and fresh.

Best of all, I believe, was the cluing, through which Boaz’s personality shined.  Time and again today I resisted putting in an answer because either there were several possibilities, or because I was simply and totally flummoxed.  But every time, eventually, when the answer filled in, it made perfect sense. That’s very good cluing.

Boaz went the extra mile in the cluing, and here are two examples.  
• MOTTO has shown up in the major crossword outlets more than 100 times, but never clued by contrasting the language of state mottos.  
• He took a dry answer, APTLY, and made it dazzle with the Vin Diesel clue. 

So, he has the cluing knack. Upper tier, iMO.

Boaz, I learned from your notes at XwordInfo that you’ve been making puzzle for less than a year and a half. Wow!  

I also learned that you’ve got another themeless in the queue.  I’m greatly looking forward to that after today’s splendid outing.  Thank you.  This was a jewel!",55,positive,0.9362536668777466

English vs. Italian plurals aside, I'm trying to think of an aria that *isn't* a solo.
