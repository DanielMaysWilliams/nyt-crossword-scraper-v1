"Most frustrating NYT Crossword to date for me, but that‚Äôs not saying much, as I am rather new to the commitment to these puzzles. Typically I learn quite a bit of factual information and love having a laugh when I see various connections. I am still looking up some of how the structure of a clue will impact the correct entry. 

I did not see or understand the cleverness of this puzzle and felt irritated by that until I came to the comments. I wanted validation for my irritation, and I got that, but finally read a comment that made several sections of the puzzle and cross words click! Whew! So I have mostly changed my opinion of this Saturday puzzle even though it was still frustrating. I am now feeling a good frustration and even that bit of frustration is on me and my inexperience, not the constructors of the puzzle.

Thank you for teaching me so much more about the NYT Crossword and not just the basic trivia of different subjects.

"I just realized that I hadn't done today's puzzle yet--our power went out at 9:45 last night and I got busy with other things today.

I felt like it was one of the easier Saturday puzzles--I finished it in about 2/3 of my usual Saturday time. I didn't like FEMININE SIDE  clued the way it was or EVENER/I CAN'T EVEN/EVER all being in there. I'd never heard of an E RATING, but it was obvious from the crosses.

"This really is about the July 14 puzzle, and crossword puzzles in general, but since I cannot find any other place to leave these comments, here they are.

I am in the minority, but there are too many puns and trendy memes words in the puzzles of today. July 14 included the palindrome KLAUSACTCASUALK. Make sense to you? You are supposed to think of sloppily elided slang, K? Also, the current buzzword for an unromantic person (one who prefers platonic relationships) is ARO. Look, I don't mind having to look up the co-star of some streaming show that I never heard of but I would prefer my puzzles to avoid utter nonsense and contain proper English.

Now enjoy hurling your flaming bolts my way. I will be looking for another outlet with better crossword puzzles that don't require regular visits to Tik-Tok.",2,neutral,0.550250232219696
"Tough one for me, but an enjoyable challenge. I needed a lot of help from crosses, but got there in the end. KIVA was new to me, but will try to remember it. The KEG crossing helped there. I enjoyed the clue for WRENS, though I wasn‚Äôt familiar with that call. I do love birds, and watching our backyard birds at the feeder. There is only one call I recognize, and that‚Äôs our local Mountain Chickadee, aka the ‚Äúcheeseburger bird‚Äù. Nothing to do with cheeseburgers of course but it‚Äôs a note followed by a double note a step down. Not sure if that description makes sense, but I can whistle that three note sound while out hiking, and I swear the birds sing it back to me in answer. That‚Äôs the extent of my bird calls.

"weak puzzle. Lots of shaky clues, stretched words. For example, that answer isn't the subject of the miracle, it's the raw material for the miracle. Many more. Frustrating answers--not the kind where you say ""Ah!"" The kind where you say ""Nah.""",7,negative,0.849480152130127
"My favorite thing about this puzzle is 32D I CAN'T EVEN because I just happened to use it for the first time yesterday when I posted on Facebook. Hope this doesn't cross a line but it involved the notion that childless women, such as myself, don't have a stake in the country and want others to be miserable... and the implication we are miserable without children. Though we did all we could to try to have kids, miserable I am not! I CAN'T EVEN struck me for the first time as the most adequate way to summarize my feelings about it so it was funny to see it show up.

And it was one of the few things I got easily in this puzzle. I got there but I didn't allow myself a gold streak because I accidentally saw the picture of the LEANING TOWER on my large monitor, so that wasn't great. I'm not sure how I would have fared without being able to fill it in immediately without crosses. I also did a few confirmation checks. I was very uncertain about some things on the left side, especially the top. So not what I consider a clean solve for myself.

I strongly disliked FEMININE SIDE to the point of my own peril in not wanting to accept it as a possible answer. That capped off this not being a favorite puzzle for me. 

I like a challenge and keep trying to get better, but I like fun word play and some laughs.

"Wrens say ""teakettle""? [looks it up] Ah right, the Carolina wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus), which according to Wikipedia says

""Some general vocalizations have been transcribed as teakettle-teakettle-teakettle and cheery-cheery-cheery. Various descriptions of the teakettle song include whee-udel, whee-udel, whee-udel, che-wortel, che-wortel and t√∫rtee-t√∫rtee-t√∫rtee and familiar names and phrases such as sweet heart, sweet heart, come to me, come to me, sweet William, and Richelieu, Richelieu"". 

The last are presumably literate birds who have been reading The Three Musketeers.

This is something new to me so I've learned something. I don't think Momma B my late Mom-in-Law had Carolina wrens at her many feeders.

Our own very common wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), more often heard than seen, is a fine singer but does tend to sound like a machine gun when alarmed. Definitely not teakettle, nor even Richelieu",9,neutral,0.8207584619522095

WIM is a name?  I CAN'T EVEN.
RATED E??  For EVERYbody or something?

Though they‚Äôre not necessarily Naticks, TIG Notaro and WIM Wenders made it extremely difficult to get a foothold in their respective regions. (Seriously, I feel bad for these people. Who named them?!). You also have a golf apparel brand and ‚Äúguess what the hell I mean‚Äù non-clues like, ‚ÄúUnlike this answer,‚Äù that make me roll my eyes in disgust. 

The rest of the grid wasn‚Äôt bad, necessarily, but there is just no way I would ever have gotten some of these answers without being able to guess and test letters. Too many answers like NOTAR, ALT-comedy and KEG stand crossed with TEAL, ERST, KIVA and NORA. Even with _IVA and _OTAR, I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten them right. I had LOTAR and no idea what to put in for KIVA, so I just ran the alphabet until K worked. 

The only cool thing I will remember from this puzzle is Islam means ‚Äúsubmission.‚Äù That‚Äôs a fun factoid. 

I just am tired of Saturdays basically coming down to knowing the trivia or not. The clues are just too unhelpful for you to make much headway for the trickier answers, and if you don‚Äôt know the name of some foreign movie star or bad comic, you won‚Äôt be able to make much progress. I should be having an enjoyable time, not exclaiming in disgust when I come across an answer like TIG. (Seriously, poor guy.)",53,negative,0.8306736946105957
"I‚Äôll be darned. I just checked with google and it turns out this puzzle constructor and I have identical search histories! WIM? Check. TIG? Check. VAL Cherm ‚Ä¶? Yup. Swedish holidays? Of course. Gospel of Matthew? You bet. I happened to know Awkwafina‚Äôs name, because I had an aunt, but we both googled it just to be sure. ALLYSON? A gimme (please, Siri, gimme sumpin!) He did catch me on 16 across: Alexa suggested HOLOSEXUAL from aesthetics.com. That hung me up for 4 minutes. Coincidence, you say? Sure, why not. Ha!

There should be allowed a generic clue for ‚Äòa nonsense syllable ot two I got stuck with after all my very clever entries kind of almost stacked up, and I‚Äôm sure if I wanted to spend the time I could devise a clue, but solvers can too, so whatever letters you want to put in I‚Äôm cool with it‚Äô. It would feel so much more honest, wouldn‚Äôt it?",12,neutral,0.5609074234962463

"I'm willing to be the first one to say that this was a show off for the constructors.  But ultimately so arcane as not to be fun.

But the late Eugene Maleska, asked whether it was fair to look up answers in a dictionary, replied that he thought it was since, after all, the constructors do.",118,neutral,0.5192798972129822
