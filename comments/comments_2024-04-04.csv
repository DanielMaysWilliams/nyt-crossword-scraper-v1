"Bit of a slightly off-topic question/complaint: 

I usually play the crossword on my computer and mobile phone. Today, I paused my puzzle to go to my acupuncture appointment, and came back a couple hours later only to see that the timer had somehow been running the entire time! Is this a new thing or a bug of some kind? Has this happened to anyone else??

Even if I'd somehow left it running (which I know I didn't because this is a habit for me now), I thought the webpage auto-pauses the game anyway after a certain amount of inactivity.

I want to ignore it, but I know every time I look at my stats, I'll feel annoyed that my average time for Thursdays is so skewed. Before this, my crossword stats trend line was nicely ascending (with Saturdays/Sundays being my longest, which I feel is appropriately reflective of the difficulty level of the later-in-week puzzles). Now, annoyingly and presumably for eternity (?), will I have to accept that Thursdays are somehow my ""most difficult"" puzzle on average?

Anybody know if/how I can fix this?",0,negative,0.4891462028026581
"In regards to 40A: I'm surprised the editor didn't catch this. Bog is not a synonym for FEN, in fact the word difference distinguishes two clearly distinct biomes. Fens are alkaline, bogs are acidic. The clue ""wetland"" or ""peatland"" would've worked, or ""often mistaken for a bog"", or ""wetland that can become a bog"", but fens are not bogs. The whole reason both words are still in common parlance is because the differing pH levels lead to distinct flora and fauna, so it's a valuable bit of info for anyone in the natural sciences.

Even though martinis (Hendricks with a twist - no olives for me!) is my favorite, I thought the grid was maybe a clown face at first. It looked like a smile to me. When I worked out SHAKEN, I figured it out! 

Learned a few words I didn't know that I thankfully could get from the crosses. ON TILT, I'm happy to say, I retained from an earlier puzzle. TBAR seems to be sticking, as well. 

Favorite clue was for RAGTIME! Ha! I got EWE from crossings but had no idea why. I looked it up after the puzzle and see that Dolly was a cloned sheep. I must have been busy from '96 to '03 because I don't recall ever hearing of her.

"I quite liked this puzzle. Fair and fun and silly, and with the chewier entries having very sussable crosses. It had personality. And I like the theme.

I only got around to my first martini in the early 2000s or 2010s. My (not very frequent) drinks were Kahlua-and-Cream, maybe a Screwdriver, or a Whiskey Sour, and I was game to try any Kahlua-adjacent drinks. Wasn't a fan of gin, but then realized it was *tonic* I really didn't like. Anyway, one day after buying some fun thrift-store cocktail glasses I mixed my first martini for myself. Beefeater's gin, olives, a teensy bit of vermouth, very gently stirred. I liked it!

No ice: I'd just fill a few mini bottles with gin (pints or airplane-tiny-sized) & keep 'em in the freezer, where the gin stayed liquid but cold.

When I solved today's puzzle I couldn't figure out what that red thing was in the picture. I thought, who puts a cherry in a martini?! when I realized it must be the pimiento. I LOVE lots of olives in my martini, but I use the good fresh meaty green olives that don't have pimentos. I skewer about four big fat olives on a stirrer and they're a main feature of the martini.

I consider a ""dirty martini"" me putting a little splash of the oil that comes w/the good olives into the glass. Especially if it's olive-bar olives. Not the brine from a standard yucky green-olives jar.

Make a martini with proportions you are happy with (enough green gin to plain gin to vermouth), and serve with a jalapeño stuffed olive.

"Enjoyed overall, especially the now-all-too-rare literary quotation. One caveat:  this puzzle contains far too many sports-related answers, including some obscure ones.

DQ-ing and BATTERS were new to me, as was ""ON TILT,"" but at least that one could be sussed out.

TOE POKE and REC Specs were additional never-heards that arrived thanks only to their crosses.

I'm old enough to remember LEO Durocher; BIBS is kind of obvious even to the non-sports minded; and T BAR is more than familiar from previous puzzles.

For me, eight sports terms is eight too many, but let's say at least twice the number one might reasonably expect in a weekday (small-format) puzzle.

My two cents. Deb?

BTW, I know what you mean about comparing all future martinis to that first, mind-blowing lemon one. I had prosciutto and melon while overlooking a canal in Venice about a million years ago (not, like your martini, consumed for the first time) and neither item, esp. the melon, has come close since.

"@Deb Amlen
I enjoyed your nostalgic reminiscences of your first ""martiini"", but is a Lemon Drop a martini?  To this old-fashioned purist (and pedant), a martini is, as the puzzle suggests, a mixture of a lot of gin and a little vermouth, chilled with ice in a shaker (or stirred in a pitcher) and then strained into a handsome glass.
(Could it be a COUPE glass [48A]?  I think so and bemoan this missed opportunity for the clue writers.)
Nowadays it seems any mixture of strong drink can be called a martini (apple martini, espresso martini, cosmos, your lemon drop, etc.).  The only shared characteristic seems that they are served in a martini glass.

"What a debut!

It was three puzzles for me-

West was a fast-fill, frivolous, free-for all.

East was a Saturday-ish head-scratcher.

"This one had nice grid design and the color graphics were a nice surprise.  The cost of that, however, was more three letter fill than I care for.  On the other hand, as a cocktail lover, I enjoyed the theme. I’m a stirred, not shaken man, 007 notwithstanding.  I’m also something of a martini purist (some would say bore) as I lament the dilution of the martini to include drinks made with ingredients other than gin, vermouth and either an olive or a lemon twist.  Even adding a cocktail onion changes it to a Gibson.  Using vodka, or (shudder) flavored vodka or cordials changes it to something else altogether.  I also lament the trend to put so little vermouth in that the drink essentially becomes nothing more than a glass of iced gin. The vermouth is meant to complement the gin, not to be superfluous gesture.",13,positive,0.8392471671104431
"I started with a thrilling crossword moment:

Looked at the grid, saw it was asymmetrical, wondered why, and after the first word I filled in (DOH), my brain from out of nowhere shouted “Martini glass!”. Then I glanced at the clue for 3D spanner, and without hesitation filled in SHAKEN NOT STIRRED.  Swee-eet!

The rest of the fill-in was The Tale of Two Cities, whoosh-ville and inscruta-burg, areas of splat, and zones of battle, the battle coming from no-knows and vague clues, resulting in return-to’s and, eventually, ahas. 

Well, since I love both the rush of bam-bam-bam, and the hard-work riddle solves, unraveling this was an all-encompassing pleasure. 

If anyone’s solve time was a bit longer than usual, it could be because of the extra row (put in, no doubt, to accommodate SHAKEN NOT STIRRED).

I love ELIXIR OF QUIETUDE, so calming and beautiful in sound and feel.  Never heard it before.  Serendipitously sharing the puzzle with SITCOM, which sounds like SIT CALM.  I also loved the PuzzPair© of CASTE and AWAY.

"Big fan of the MARTINI. Since 007 was referenced, here is a recipe for the Vesper Martini.  Note: this contains a modification from the instructions that Bond gave to the bartender because Kina Lillet is no longer available.

• 3 parts London dry gin
• 1 part vodka
• 1 part Lillet Blanc
• Angostura bitters*

Combine the ingredients in a mixing glass with ice. Stir until well-combined and a bit of water is introduced into the drink, about 30 seconds.  Drop a little bit of Angostura bitters into the bottom of a chilled glass, then strain the drink into the glass.  Express a lemon twist over the drink and serve promptly.  You can float a thin slice of lemon if you like.

*Note: I recommend this ingredient which introduces a bitter quality to the Lillet Blanc that Kina Lillet had but the current version lacks.

"Very quick solve until I got to the SW.  COUPE went in fast, as did REA even though I only know the name from crosswords.

As often happens, BRAVURA saved the day and opened up the rest of the corner.  

As for a Thursday puzzle, no.  My time was a little long compared to recent (very easy) Thursday puzzles, but that was from personal knowledge gaps, not a tough puzzle.  Bring back tricky Thursday!!

"On another note, though I have been skiing for 61 of my 66 years, and was briefly on the US Olympic Ski Team, the only place I have seen a t-bar in the last several decades is in the NY Times crossword. 

They were frightening when I was little. Any difference in size or weight between the two passengers immediately led to imbalance and loss of purchase. My father was 180 pounds, and I was, what...50? I did a face plant nearly every time when trying to get on during the first season. Fortunately, though my father was a very determined person, he was also very patient with his many, many children.

I eventually got the knack, and then they were gone....",21,neutral,0.7256988286972046
"Golly, that was cute, replete with pimento upon completion. ONTILT and  TOEPOKE were revelatory, but even more surprising was the notion of quietude in association with martinis. Having grown up in a family with some heavy drinkers, I have more often seen boisterous and sometimes belligerent behavior associated with this particular elixer. 

My maternal grandfather is reported to have said, ""Martinis are like women's breasts: one is not enough; three are too many; two are just right.""

One martini
Two martini
Three martini

"Fun puzzle. I didn’t notice the grid shape, but somehow hit on 3D early on. After that it was a case of chasing down the other components of one of my favourite drinks, though I prefer a dirty MARTINI with two olives. Btw; a pimento? No. Just no. Silver skin onion if you must, but otherwise leave my olive alone.

4A was a gimme, being the name of one of my sons. No he wasn’t born on that day.

I initially thought I was in for a tough fill, with host names, sports names, company names, not to mention two clues referencing US law/constitution. But, as with the best MARTINIs, it made for a smooth solve that slipped down easily.

Biggest hold up was fillies for BATTERS. Mention a derby and I automatically go for the geegees.

"A refreshing puzzle, and it even made me feel a little heady.  The martini glass was a bit of a puzzle all by itself, though.  Was the red meant to be a pimento in the olive?  I don't like martinis much, and usually go for something sissy-er, like a piña colada, or a pastis, or a Campari and soda, and all of this makes me long for a sidewalk cafe in Paris.

One night when I went back to the Cafe Les Deux Magots and asked the waiter if I had left my umbrella there, he came back to the table, shook his head, and launched into a song about la femme sort toutes les nuits sans son parapluie (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh), and we all started laughing.

For me, the puzzle was three parts smoothness, one part struggle.

Then, I must have mistyped that answer, because it didn’t fit when I first tried it. 

After that, it was pretty easy until I hit the SE. I didn’t know the E.B. White quote and the concentration of the crossing sports answers (34A TOEPOKE, 44A DQED, 54A BATTERS) didn’t help me get the quote any quicker.
