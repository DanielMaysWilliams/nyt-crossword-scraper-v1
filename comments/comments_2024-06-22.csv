"Good puzzle, hard going, but that's what Saturdays are s'posed to be. Very savory.

I don't really pay attention to 'time' on the crosswords-- except maybe for the Minis and a tiny bit on Mondays-- but was startled to see 38m45s on this one, I could swear it took longer than that as I usually do on Saturdays, but then I can pretty much throw the ""puzzle solving time"" stat out the window these days cuz every time the app crashes (on my ancient J3 Luna Pro on which I do NYT games) it wacks up the time when it restarts, usually cutting many minutes off. At some point I'll probably go back in time, like in those ""implode the engines for fun and profit"" Star Trek episodes. and when I do I'll be sure to bring back some tasty, choice and extremely affordable cuts of meat and/or produce for everyone. Filet mignon 59¬¢/lb. Apples 5¬¢. Courtesy of a wacked out NYT app and/or phone. You're welcome.


Where was i? Oh yeah right, the puzzle. Good stuff. Some nice entries and clues.

After being startled that a ballet exercise in the crossword was NOT pli√©, and dismissing rond de jambe as too long, it took me just a few seconds to think of FRAPP√â. Having been a dance accompanist for 40+ years probably helped.

For FRAPP√âS I'd often play either the Presto theme from the 4th movement of Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony, or maybe The Galaxy Song from Monty Python. Whichever worked.

Or was that for Grand Battements? I forget‚Ä¶

Glad I made it through this one relatively unscathed. Thanks, Hoang-Kim.",13,negative,0.4815576374530792
"Said it couldn't be done.  Not ACREs but inches to plow this field, a killer of a puzzle with some snappy SYNAPSEs (I think).  None of it was easy for me, and I must FESS UP, I had to PEER IN to the Great God Google (or the GGG, a current correlative of the OED) to confirm some guesses and avoid BROACHing the DEATH SPIRAL.   For the final clue 61A, you need only think of the 17th Century Sicilian monastery gardener, Francisco Cupani, a dedicated PLANT SITTER.

Hoang-Kim Vu, you had some fun with us this time,  and so did we with you.  Get some rest, friend, and we will too, to be ready for your next brain crusher.  Thank you!",21,negative,0.6891984939575195
"By pure coincidence, I solved this while watching COCKTAIL (the referenced Tom Cruise movie that features Kokomo) for the very first time.

Probably cut my solving time in half, and I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing.",14,positive,0.7864686250686646
"I'm happy to register here that my SYNAPSEs didn't falter, though I'm sure some might have short-circuited.

____urbis conditae? Huge knowledge gap on my part. 
Luckily, FRAPPES were once a part of my life, EONLINE is not followed yet I'm aware of it, and  those SYNAPSEs didn't let me down. 

Getting to PANDA was a whole different story. 
My brain was momentarily soaked in laughter when all I could think of for [It's black and white (and sometimes red)] was...my wardrobe! (Well, okay, there's also grey, so it couldnt be that.)

And here I was thinking that yesterday's puzzle was the one that fried my brain.
But guess what, I loved going from 0 to 180, UTURNED, turned on my head, and turned inside out.

Thank you, Mr. Hoang-Kim Vu for a great ride!",17,positive,0.6560004353523254

"Much more challenging than Friday‚Äôs puzzle. I was glad for the proper names that got me started (Uzo ADUBA, NORA, and especially Arundhati ROY, whose ‚ÄúThe God of Small Things‚Äù is one of my favorite novels). 

I liked the clues for ART STORE and SYNAPSE. I‚Äôm less keen on answers like TESTEES and BESTREW; neither seems like something I have ever heard in casual conversation. I‚Äôm also not sure I buy ‚ÄúIlluminating example‚Äù as a clue for ANALOGY, which to me implies a comparison. ‚ÄúEpitome‚Äù seems closer to the clue.",28,positive,0.9076867699623108
too esoteric for me. I walked away after 30 minutes. do pen pals send each other cards? not letters? Aduba? Eeg? Even when I got the answers I thought they were wrong. Hoping I enjoy tomorrow's better.,6,negative,0.7779257893562317

"This was a very worthy Saturday.  Greek, Latin, literature, American history, pop culture and more.  What a wide ranging puzzle.  Most of the general knowledge questions were well outside my sphere of knowledge.  Only the fact that I used ATRA plus razors for years gave me any type of foothold from the acrosses (well that and the ubiquitous ICEE).  Luckily there were enough guessable downs that I could eventually piece everything together.  I anticipate a lot of complaints, but I like a challenge like this.",40,positive,0.9194773435592651

"HERES A TIP: nice Saturday workout.

If DEATH SPIRAL and PLANT SITTER 
were the marquee entries as Caitlin suggests, 
I put them on the marquee quickly.

The handheld object crossing the pharmacy brand 
took a bit more thought, as did the ballet exercises.

Don't forget to pay the PIPER.

GOTTA go.",10,positive,0.5703874230384827
"I read the 1A clue and, despite not knowing much about Japanese cooking, decided to go with MISO PASTE with confidence, setting the tone for the top half.  I knew ARUBA and its pal ADUBA. so they went in, and I kinda wanted KAPPA , but I had put IN PERIL for 2D, so I had to rework that.  The bottom half was a little slower, as fewer of my guesses panned out.

Some other missteps:  TAX DAY for MONDAY, PETER for PIPER (although I guess, they had to pay Peter Piper for his pickled peppers); like Deb, SAINTS for FAITHS and GRAIN for GRIST; LADY for LASS; CARE for ATRA (plus).

Things I suspected and waited for because I had faulty crosses, which turned out to be right:  ESTONIA, BESTREW, U-TURNED, and as I said, KAPPA.  

About the clue for ACRE:  Did the size of the ACRE vary throughout the year?  It seems it would be very big this time of year, when the sun is up the longest (at least in the Northern Hemisphere), and very short in December...maybe they didn't quite think that one through?

Also, since my house sits on nearly an acre, I have a good sense of how much land that is, and it seems to me that with oxen or other beasts of burden, it wouldn't take nearly a day to plow one acre.  Maybe just the farmer alone?",8,neutral,0.7876917123794556
"I never heard the term STIM TOY either. That little area, with ART STORE, was my last fill. I was happy that some of my guesses (like FRAPPES and MISO PASTE) panned out. Others, of course, didn't. I wanted the clue for STEAMERS to be something clammy.",8,positive,0.5207166075706482
