I knew when I saw a debugging line is some code with a comment that it was a ""sanity check"" I immediately understood.

No damage, but for two days, no power, NO WATER!, no internet, no phone.  Saturday night the power came back on, but all the other things are off.  (I found a wifi place a good distance from home.)

Oh, right, it's Monday -- a day when, more often than not, only one word in a two-word theme answer gets to be involved or relevant.  Sigh.

But, still,  it's a graceful, grown-up grid with some very nice long Downs and nothing that's too VANILLA or STALE.  And there's a lovely clue for SINK (11D).   So as Mondays go, it's not half bad (pun intended).

Addendum to the AIR clue at 61D:  Well, at least it was.

A tip to those not in the know:  The thing I was told practically the first day I set foot on the Smith College campus is that you don't pronounce the ""H"" in AMHERST.  It's pronounced AMerst.   Say it right or get the side-eye from just about everybody.

"An enjoyable Monday puzzle. None of the theme answers dawning on me just from the clues, but they all fell together with some crosses. Just made for a nice workout. 

Puzzle find today - a trick I don't recall encountering before. A Thursday from February 10, 2011 by Derek Bowman. Five theme answers, all proper names (with a five letter surname) and each one changing one letter in the surname from one to the next. Those answers: 

DONNAKARAN
ELENAKAGAN
CARLSAGAN
KATEYSAGAL
ERICHSEGAL

"This was slow for me for a Monday, at almost 10 minutes: probably because of quite a lot of trivia and expressions I did not know, like BOOBIRDS. I enjoyed the solve though and needed no lookups. However, I was not very fond of the clue for SLAV. I know it was technically correct, because many Balkan nations are largely Slavic, but not all of them are: what about Albanians and Greeks? There are so many better ways to clue SLAVs - why use one that is either inaccurate or misleading, and on a Monday, too?

Yesterday Sotto Voce asked about kohlrabi (the Polish ""kalarepa/kalarepka"") and Joya was interested in it, too. It is quite a common vegetable here, available for most of the warm months. It is whitish or pale green, round, of a size that varies somewhat - usually it is about as large as an orange or grapefruit. Sometimes it is sold with leaves, sometimes with the greens removed (they are edible, I heard, but never tried them myself). You have to peel it with a sharp knife, making sure you remove all the tough fibers which sit right below peel on the root end. The flesh is juicy and quite firm, and it should be sweet-ish. If it is dry and beginning to crack, it has been sitting too long and it will taste of nothing. You can eat it raw, but it is also delicious diced into cubes (smallish ones) cooked in water and served with melted butter (I enjoy vegan food, but sometimes butter is the only fit for something, and this is one of those cases, IMO).",12,negative,0.5958725810050964

"EZRA Pound reviewed ""North of Boston,"" a book of poetry by AMHERST professor Robert Frost,  including the poem ""Mending Wall""



Something there is that doesn‚Äôt love a wall,
That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,
And spills the upper boulders in the sun;
And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.

...

We keep the wall between us as we go.
To each the boulders that have fallen to each.
And some are loaves and some so nearly balls
We have to use a spell to make them balance:
‚ÄòStay where you are until our backs are turned!‚Äô
We wear our fingers rough with handling them.
Oh, just another kind of outdoor game,
One on a side. It comes to little more:
There where it is we do not need the wall:

...

He only says, ‚ÄòGood fences make good neighbors.‚Äô
Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder
If I could put a notion in his head:
‚ÄòWhy do they make good neighbors? Isn‚Äôt it
Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.

...

Before I built a wall I‚Äôd ask to know
What I was walling in or walling out,
And to whom I was like to give offense.

That wants it down.‚Äô",21,neutral,0.8655573725700378
