There is a lot of controversy about a certain clue and I totally get it. Should controversial and politically charged clues and answers be included in the crossword? I’m honestly not sure but I stand by the constructors inclusion of GWBush nevertheless.,11,neutral,0.5788342356681824

"Speaking as an agender transmasculine person who was assigned female at birth, I am grateful for the inclusion of the 14A in this puzzle. The wording of both the clue and answer align with current best practices for describing sex and gender.

I am very well aware that many other people are *not* fine with this use of language. Such people have many outlets to express their dissatisfaction. This comment section does not need to be one of them.",40,positive,0.806358277797699

My mom’s OB (male, obvi) announced to her:
“One.  Baby.  Girl.”

In light of today’s discussion, that does indeed seem like a 1958 style “assignment”.

I also wish there was a place to comment about Strands  other than here.  No spoilers from me, but I found today’s puzzle, which I whipped right through,quite unappetizing. The fact that I knew all the answers and got the spanagram  immediately doesn’t mean I enjoyed it.  I suspect that makes me an old fogey.",5,negative,0.5561436414718628

"AKIN to the Hippocratic oath, cruciverbally, first I solve the puzzle. And if that action does no harm, then I will hunt for the darned theme. This method of mind (no typo) is flexible though, as I get the value of theme identification early on in a solve…12 seconds over my Monday avg. but I hardly strictly solve for speed…If you ever get the chance to take in the seascape from San LUIS Obispo, you’ll keep that Pacific memory in your mind’s eye forever…Germane to content, but not the theme, this Chuck Berry rock/doo-wop amalgam is probably early 60’s vintage, if not late ‘50’s…Bye for now WPers.

Solid Monday puzzle; nice debut.
I am sure there are misguided babies who say DADA first, but mine did not.  Why not clue it as the art movement?  ""ARP grp?""  Duchamp was recently featured, come to think of it; usually the NYT does not eschew repetition.

I am relieved to be feeling much more myself, if easily tired.  The mosquitos are enjoying the humid heat, which also seems to suit the fire ants, who are on a building binge....and some displaced beavers or muskrats  have invaded the lake and girdled two young bald cypress trees...a local environmental disaster (consequence of a nearby construction project across the city border.)",6,neutral,0.5250430703163147

"Nice breezy Monday puzzle and a wonderful debut for Robert Corridan. I certainly knew MALALA right away, but wouldn’t have known her last name without the help of crosses. Same for De Gaulle’s birthplace. Otherwise, everything was in my wheelhouse I’d say. I hope we will see more puzzles from Mr. Corridan in future.",8,positive,0.9426814913749695
"A tougher than usual Monday puzzle but an enjoyable solve. Just had to work the crosses in a lot of places but managed to work it all out. 

Couldn't help but note the currently somewhat appropriate inclusion of...

We'll see how that goes.

"Sweet little play on words, referring to the group of four theme answers as LA LA LAND.  And a sweet moment for me, who left that revealer blank, and tried to figure out what it was – something I’m weak at and working on – and got it!

Maybe it was obvious and easy to correctly guess the revealer today, but if you tell me that, I’m going to LALALALALALALA you.  

I think Malala’s full name looks gorgeous across the middle.  That answer, along with LA LAKERS, have been used only once before in the Times puzzle, while VANILLA LATTE and RURAL ALABAMA are answer debuts, giving the theme high spark.

I liked the unusual letter combination starts in GWBush and PTRap, as well as ISLE over IDLE.  I enjoyed the lovely LILLE and fun-to-say BLABBY.  I got a kick out of the STELMO dook, as well as the PuzzPair© of BRAD and NAIL.  And I’m not sure why, but I loved having YOU staring at me from the dead center of the grid.

Congratulations on your debut, Robert, and thank you for starting my day with a deep-down smile!",28,positive,0.928317666053772

Great start to the week, Robert, looking forward to more.",15,positive,0.9730767011642456
"Having just read the comments, I'd like to say I'm surprised, but some were very predictable.

I'm so bored with posters who become apoplectic every time certain words appear in the puzzle.  As an atheist, I guess I could complain about ""propaganda"" every time a religious reference is made in the puzzle.  I don't, because you know what?  The world doesn't revolve around me.  Maybe you should realize that you aren't the center of everything, and you might try to get out more and talk to people with different life experiences.  It may just change your perspective.",66,negative,0.7491133213043213

"Some solvers may get the impression from this puzzle and Mr. Higgins' puzzle on Sept. 12 that not only is an iamb a foot, but a foot is an iamb. Well I'm here to tell you, as your cis-mansplaining prosodist, that iamb is one of the most common poetic feet, but not the only kind. A refresher course:

IAMB: unstressed + stressed.
   Examples from puzzle: ALONE, AZUL, UNMET, AKIN

TROCHEE: stressed + unstressed
   Examples from puzzle: HONDA, ULTRA, ANSEL, ISLE, PARKA, WOMAN, NEATEN, YELL TO (and that's just in the upper third); RURAL ALABAMA is perfect trochaic trimeter. 

ANAPEST: unstressed+unstressed+stressed
   Examples from puzzle: there's one buried in RURAL ALABAMA, MALALA YOUSAFZAI, and also possibly in VANILLA LATTE

DACTYL: Stressed+unstressed+unstressed
   Examples from puzzle: IDIOTS, LA LA LAND, the ""W"" in GW BUSH

PYRRHIC OR DIBRACH: unstressed+unstressed
   Examples from puzzle: the ""LA"" of LA LAKERS, not sure if there are any others

SPONDEE: stressed+stressed
   Examples from puzzle: YELL TO, D DAY, DADA (I would have preferred that clued as ""Marcel Duchamp's first word, perhaps?""), LIMPED IN

Then there are the more obscure ones, the AMPHIBRACH (unstressed+stressed+unstressed, as in VANILLA, POMELO; the ANTIBACCHIUS (stressed+stressed+unstressed), as in CIS WOMAN; and there some other variations as well, one of my favorites being the MOLOSSUS, consisting of three stressed syllables. As in: I'll end here.",80,neutral,0.7808136940002441

"Great puzzle. Loved the theme! Congratulations Robert Corridan on your debut puzzle.  I hope to see more from you.  Your clues and theme were lovely.  I really enjoyed solving.

That said, I could have solve sooner if I had remembered the name of that darned band 64A.  I had ""AV AID"" for 50D and got locked into not questioning my ""Ego"" choice for the solve.  The upshot was hunting for a typo instead of rethinking my answers sooner. I think my mother called that pig-headed.  When I finally got around to thinking ""av aid"" was a cumbersome fit for 50D, I was able to solve the puzzle.  

Nice day for puzzling.  Too hot here for the park.  Now for the Emmys.  Y'all have a nice evening. Cheers from Texas!",7,positive,0.950146496295929
"I smile when I read about what's right or not right in the crossword clues and answers.  It reminds me of a time when I was sitting next to a man on a Brooklyn bus.  He was doing the Friday NYT puzzles and filling in the spaces at a rapid pace. I couldn't help but react and told him that was quite impressive.  He then told me he was putting letters in the boxes just to fill in the grid, He enjoyed having people think he was a puzzle wizard.  I smiled, thinking, ""Why would he reveal his secret to me?""
My point is, he enjoyed doing the puzzle his way.  Not everything is designed to individual tastes. It's a pleasant escape - a challenge to our little gray cells - an opportunity to learn things and recall things or it's just a chance to fill in the grid.  
Whatever it is, enjoy yourself in the best of health and spirit.
May the week ahead provide you with what you need for that to come true.",50,positive,0.8914433717727661

"Cute theme, and it all felt fast and fresh to me!  It's hard to be unhappy when repeating LALAs... Unless maybe you're doing it to avoid listening to what your annoying big brother is saying. Lalala I'm not listening! Not that I'd have ever done that...

Also, nice to see the wonderfully distinguished Mr. Rickman! I first became impressed with him in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, which I loved at the time. OKBUT, you say, didn't that movie have a lot of flaws, like Costner's accent!? What can I say, I thought Costner was dreamy and it introduced me to Rickman and Morgan Freeman!  Both ended up sort of stealing the show for me... Rickman with his portrayal of the droll and delightfully wicked sheriff of Nottingham--and his creative use for spoons--and Freeman with his response to being asked if God painted him: For certain. (Why?) Because Allah loves wondrous variety.
