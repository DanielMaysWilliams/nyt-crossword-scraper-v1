""Some tabloid fodder.""

"I really enjoyed 99% of this puzzle. Cracked it open very late Friday night -- never the best idea, and reaaally questionable behavior for a Saturday grid! I was more than a third of the way through the Acrosses before taking a desperate stab with SAT FOR. Such a satisfying change in emotions when something like that turns out to be correct! 

Then there were a number of answers at the blacked-out edge of my sleep-craving brain: trying to come up with the specific name of the old Hollywood CODE... I knew it wasn't Audra MacDonald, and pretty certain of NUUK, but not enough to actually type it in... AAVE was just referenced by a recent commenter, but the V was escaping me... 

Thank goodness for rote memorization of certain Shakespearean soliloquies! And S.A.T. vocabulary (looking at you, AUGUR). And GETAWAY CAR! Plus, PLANETARIA was a gimme: the only science museums of my youth, Boston & NYC, each had one, and the plural was easy to discern.

Because beasts before BEAUTS, and trouble in the lower half with answers well trod already in these comments. Loved loved loved the LAS Vegas misdirect once I got it, but it took a *while*!

I had to ""cheat"" twice, but both were great TILs--I should have known NUUK, since my husband is a circumpolar specialist, but somehow Greenland's capital hasn't gotten into my vocabulary until now.  And I had to look up Anrdea Beaty, and found myself a whole new author of kid-lit, which is my guilty pleasure!

I'm surprised that STICKUM gave so many folks trouble--I didn't know it was a brand name, but the folks where I grew up used that term all the time for glue, etc.  RICKSTEVES was my first fill-in--I own that book!

"Apparently, ""ADAmWeST, Scientist"" is not a children's book, but it should be. No, I don't have kids, so references to their media is lost on me. See also, Peppa Pig. I did remember that Daniel was a character in the original Mister Rodgers, but I didn't know he'd taken over the franchise.

"I cheated and cheated and STILL couldn't finish.  Almost everything here ranged from a bafflement to a misery -- including some of the non-PPP answers.

The less said about the PPP, the better.

But let's start with my bafflement at ""Half of LV"".  Thinking back to my Latin numerals, I was pretty sure that LV is 55 -- and 55 cannot be halved.  If not 55, what?  I had no idea.  Now that I've looked up the answer, LAS, I see that LV is Las Vegas.

Don't ask.

I misread 40A as ""One of a maRching pair"" and confidently wrote in OOT without the first letter.  For either FOOT or BOOT -- and then I clapped myself on the shoulder for my wisdom.  Oh how the OD at the end of what was to be ABOUT FACED screwed me up.

I didn't know the DOOK-y PBS KIDS and wanted a vowel where the B went.  I didn't know ADA or RICK, but I guessed both successfully.  I started my cheating with NUUK (choosing the PPP answer that an educated person should know),I didn't know the dook-y PBS KIDS and wanted a vowel where the B went.  But I was too proud to cheat on that bit of TV trivia.  ""Block""?  Don't understand that clue at all.

"(second post)
I'm surprised that no one has commented on [Impressively respectful types]--I usually think of ""respectful"" as referring to the giving end of respect, not the receiving end. Or as the OED says: ""Of a person: full of or exhibiting respect; deferential."" As opposed to meaning 3.: ""Worthy of, or commanding, respect; respectable."", and although it has a citation form 2008, adds ""now rare."" So I kept trying things like CLASSISTS and the sort.

This, and assuming that [Dialect in the Black community] was an initialism--but for what, exactly*?--kept me hung up in the SW.

(*Yes, yes, I know, ""African-American Vernacular English""--most speakers of which exhibit diglossia. Although coined in 1972 by a Black linguist, the term ""Ebonics"" is now generally seen as derogatory, and avoided by serious linguists. So there!)

""Lab evidence, perhaps"" for PAWPRINTS was very cute. ""Half of LV"" for LAS took a long time. Rejected Roman numerals quickly, since 55 is odd. Tried ELL briefly, before deciding LV referred to Las Vegas.

"""SWEETIE as a substitute for Pumpkin? Well, I would have thought Butternut Squash, but I suppose Sweet Potato Pie is close enough to Pumpkin Pie for the clue to work. But who calls them ""sweeties""?""--

Speaking of Scotland, here's the beautiful piano piece ""Farewell to Stromness,"" by Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, who, although born in England, lived much of his life in the Orkneys, and is most closely associated with Scotland. Here performed by Adrian Lord:

I had next to nothing on first pass but, like all true Saturday puzzles, the ice gradually began to crack across the pond. However, the very NW corner simply did not fall for me and a visit to Wordplay was required. Of course there was nothing arcane about that little section...just my brain refusing to be flexible.

"Oh yes, this one did feel to me like a proper Saturday, where I resorted to throwing in stabs and hoping they would stick, where clues pointed to many possibilities, where fill-ins that I was sure of felt fabulous (not routine), and where the solve was peppered with moments of triumph, when after grimacing over a clue for ages, its trick finally clicked.

This is what I want on Saturday.

Oh, by the way, there are only two NYT constructors over its long history with the name August, and both showed up this week (August Lee-Kovach‚Äôs puzzle appeared on Thursday)!  Cue Twilight Zone theme.

A terrific part of the solve today was coursing through freshness, answers and clues never or seldom used before in the 80+ years of the Times puzzle.  In fact ‚Äì and I did the math ‚Äì one out of three answers in the grid has appeared only five times or less over that great span.  That low ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen this before‚Äù factor got my brain cranking, which it loves, and gave the puzzle the same kind of charm one gets when visiting a new country.

August, you‚Äôve had three NYT puzzles on three different days of the week.  Only one NYT constructor has ever hit the cycle ‚Äì a puzzle for every day of the week ‚Äì in their first seven puzzles, and that was Andrew Reis.  Go for it!

"When I started, I failed to see the clue for PRE-CODE ERA (a gimme), so I moved over to the NE. The combo of MAPS, MACBETH and THANE made me think I would breeze through this. Such hubris! Despite having spent almost 30 years working for STATE REPS, I interpreted the ‚Äúlocal‚Äù as ‚Äúmunicipal‚Äù and had a hard time finishing the NE corner. 

The SW corner was little better. I learned the term AAVE from a New Yorker puzzle about a year or more back. I plugged it in quickly, but took it out when the V seemed to make the crosses unworkable. Then I misinterpreted the ‚ÄúIndie‚Äù of 55A as ‚Äúindia.arie,‚Äù a singer whose music I don‚Äôt know and whose exact name I can never remember. 

And I know the difference between AUGUR and AUGeR, so it‚Äôs a mystery why I chose the wrong word. But that made it hard to see the cleverly clued URANIUM ORE. 

I didn‚Äôt have any major sticking points, just a lot of little ones. 

Thanks for the challenge, Mr. Miller!",16,negative,0.6506931781768799
"One of those puzzles where you have to remind yourself, It isn't that, think again.  Knew 1A would be some kind of dog evidence and was relieved when PUMP gave me PAWPRINTS.  Pumpkin was indeed sweet, and a perfect seasonal misdirect.  So many tangents to go off on!  

NUUK was a fluke fill‚ÄîI read Elizabeth Kolbert's New Yorker article about climate change and Greenland last night. 

It was a hard puzzle, but made easier by a couple of gimmes like MACBETH and listening to  the Warriors' 58 point blowout against the Lakers (eat your heart out, Jack Nicholson) while I took a leisurely approach to solving.

"This was a hard one but ultimately doable.  Luckily I knew of Rick Steves and the Scottish play and sealing deals on big Toyotas.  Strange that Wordplay doesn't mention the Hayes Code by name.  I confess I didn't get the ""lab"" abbreviation until I read the column.  Second time that's happened to me I think.

I don't mind state for local at all, but the abbreviation was a bit awkward, as was, especially, the positioning of rest/area.  Not as fillery or forgettable as aave and Nuuk though.

For a few delightful seconds I thought Adam West was a teen scientist.  :) A much better legacy than a vile unfunny cartoon.

I was slowed by removing PLANETARIA after boldly entering it without any crosses and I hesitated at the very end, because it just did not seem that AAVE could be correct, but I trusted the crosses, and, lo and behold, another Saturday had been conquered.
