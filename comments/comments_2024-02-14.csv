Sorry, I just had to get that out of my system.

The problem is that the V didn't look like a V to me (too curvy) and the E didn't look anything like an E to me.  The O was iffy: Grid ""art"" circles always seem iffy to me.  Only the L really looked like an L.  And therefore, I didn't know where to start or finish in trying to spell out FONDNESS, PASSION and RESPECT.  Only ROMANCE was easy for me to see.

I question CPR as a graduation requirement in ""most states""--I've never heard of that.  (Does that just mean 26?)    Even driver education is not mandatory *for graduation.*  (However, in Ohio, to be licensed a teen must take a series of classes and pass the exam, then log 50 hours of supervised driving--ten of which must be after dark-- and finally pass the test at the license bureau, which includes backing through a curving path marked by cones.  Training is not tied to graduation.

"Amazing puzzle. Quite a struggle for me, of course, but managed to work it all out. 

Regarding some earlier comments about one theme answer, all I can say is... R.E.S.P.E.C.T - find out what it means to me.

And that in part led me to a couple of remarkable puzzle finds today. One a Tuesday from July 30, 2013 by Peter A. Collins. In that one, the clue for RESPECT was :
""Honor ... and #5 on a list by 40-/46-Across of the 500 greatest songs of all time.""

Other theme answers all had the same type of dual clue, e.g.: ""Casual greeting and #4 on the list""
WHATSGOINGON

What was truly amazing was 34a. The clue:
""With 40- and 46-Across, mossless? ... and #1 on the list.""
And the answer to that was:
LIKEA

"I might have been faster if there were less six letter choices for Mexican beer. I tried Tecate and Modelo before ending up with CORONA. Overall, a LOVEly puzzle!",14,positive,0.8946791291236877
"Very cute!

Resembles those candy hearts (‚Äúoh you kid‚Äù, ‚Äúbe mine‚Äù, ‚Äúhug me‚Äù), but in crossword form.


Be mine, oh you emu.",21,positive,0.8549476861953735
"Back when I lived on Mt. Olympus, I had an edifying conversation with Hermes about the differences and, yet, surprising similarities between languages. 

For instance, I carefully etched into a tablet the English letter ‚ÄòN‚Äô each time I spoke an example word highlighting its pronunciation. 

I‚Äôll never forget the rising smile in his eyebrows as he replied, ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs NUS to me!‚Äù

(I‚Äôll show myself out.)

"Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day! Apparently over a billion are exchanged in the states if you include classroom parties. Those were the days‚Ä¶

I LOVEd that the grid art resembles those classic LOVE stamps, too. 

May many a valentine find its way to you today!",20,positive,0.9751173853874207
"Given the constrictions imposed by the theme, I‚Äôm blown away by the freshness and quality of the fill, from SEA FOAM to LADYFERN and so much more.  Xwordinfo gave it a 96% Wednesday ‚Äúfreshness‚Äù rating based on its formula, meaning that only 4% of Wednesday puzzles score higher.  Thats unbelievable in light of the intricacy of the theme - snaking four Valentine-y words in the four quadrants so that they spelled out LOVE.  Wow!",54,positive,0.9617595076560974
"I thought this was harder than most Wednesdays, with answers like VANCE and MASSE.  A fun, apt puzzle, nevertheless!

I think RESPECT is a bit different than FONDNESS/PASSION/LOVE/ROMANCE but YMMV.",26,positive,0.7671388387680054
