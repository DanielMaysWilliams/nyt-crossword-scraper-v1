Just to be absolutely sure, though, that we were going to be dealing with palindromes before I started recklessly writing in letters backwards, I took the gimme ""C"" of ARC and checked to see if there would be a ""C"" at the end of 22A.  Yep.  CZAR.  So now I have a choice.

I can mindlessly write in letters backwards -- or write backwards letters forward, if you see what I mean -- or I can try to guess at the tortured phrases with as few letters as I can manage.  Will that be fun?  Let's see.  What do I have to look forward to?

A phrase that rolls as trippingly off the tongue as CDCASEDIVIDESACDC?  A sentence as exquisitely honed as KLAUSACTCASUALK?  As Pooh might say, ""Oh bother!""

Caitlin beat me to the punch with the reference to AMANAPLANACANALPANAMA, which was the first all 'A' 21 letter answer that dawned on me. Oh, and that was an answer once - in a Sunday puzzle from January 12, 2014 by Andrew Chaikin with the title ""It's only 'A' game."" In that one all of the theme answers had 'A' as the only vowel - e.g. CASABLANCA, FALALALALA, MAGNACARTA, etc.

"I don‚Äôt see the titles before I begin solving, so I had no idea what I was in for. This started out like any other Sunday crossword, some easy clues, some I didn‚Äôt know, and I just worked my way through until I noticed something interesting‚Ä¶ the long clues had a distinct mirror quality that couldn‚Äôt be coincidental! I started filling in the mates of all the solo palindrome letters, which made the down clues much easier to solve, which quickly led to a rapid back-and-forth solving that was really quite exhilarating. 

I am new enough to crossword solving that I am not at all jaded by the theme. Like the broadcast networks used to say about reruns, if you haven‚Äôt seen it, it‚Äôs new to you! For me, this was clever, lots of fun, and easy peasy lemon squeezy, in the best way. (Seriously, if you haven‚Äôt played Squeezy, check it out. It‚Äôs a fun game, and I wouldn‚Äôt be mad it if it became part of the NYT umbrella.) My only regret about this puzzle is it didn‚Äôt last longer. Thanks, Jeff.",20,neutral,0.5082278251647949

"This was the enjoyable culmination of a week of what for me were unexpectedly easy, but fun, solves. Even this one, which required several run-throughs before I spotted an errant letter, ended up significantly below my average time. (No PB‚Äôs, although I expected Thursday‚Äôs would be one. There must have been an easy-peasy past Thursday that I don‚Äôt remember!)

Unlike Caitlin, I was impressed by how sensible these palindromes seemed. The Seuss one, in particular, could have been an actual headline! (Jeff and I were following the same story, apparently.) Okay, maybe the injunction to the uptight German was a bit out there‚Äî but even that was surprisingly apt! In any case, I thought this was a tour-de-force, albeit the conceit made solving the themers a piece of cake.

Sorry that I am late with this, but I regret if I gave the impression yesterday, when criticizing the ‚Äúserving dishes?‚Äù clue, that I was dissing the entire puzzle, which in fact I enjoyed as a whole. Great job, Eli! That inaccurate plural noun rankled, but in fact I did enjoy the attempted wordplay‚Ä¶  and I don‚Äôt even know who was responsible for that particular clue‚Äî constructor or editor(s).

Hard work and creative work.

That, by the way, is Jeff Chen.  A workhorse with a talented creative mind.

But if the solve is unsatisfying, if the puzzle isn‚Äôt engaging, then the stunt puzzle falls flat, IMO.  Not today.  Yes, these theme answers were easier to fill in because each square was a bogo, but still I couldn‚Äôt figure out the full theme answers until I had many crosses.

My brain positively loved that, loved the challenge of figuring them out with as many empty squares as possible.  That‚Äôs a Puzzle.  That‚Äôs a puzzle doing its job.

I liked the theme echo in the palindromic answer ANA, and I liked the distant echo in the decent number of semordnilaps in the grid, including the rare sighting of a semordnilap pair (IRS and SRI).

"Thanks for the great puzzle. Power's out in Minneapolis and I'm a night owl so decided to try a Sunday. I usually avoid cause of the big grid, I just like a max 15 to 20 minute solve like I get M-Sa, but this was a nice breeze with good fill!",5,positive,0.648171603679657
"Really enjoyable Sunday, and as icing on the cake, I can now add Squeezy to my daily puzzle rounds. Fun little game.",7,positive,0.989617109298706
"Great puzzle!

I usually start the puzzle before bed - giving myself 10 to 15 minutes then finish in the morning (if needed).

This one hooked me in and I had to finish!  I had various words here and there but skipped the theme entries.  The crosses gave me some letters for those, but it wasn't until I spotted the beginning and end of 99A: Seuss and issues that I realized the palindrome theme!  Even then, I thought it was just the beginning and end of the phrases.  But no!  The whole phrase is involved!

Amazing!  Thanks!",8,positive,0.9256119132041931
"Great to have EDEN in the fill. As we all know, it is the setting for the world's first palindrome- Madam, I'm Adam",42,positive,0.9760149121284485
"So I'm already late to the party in nthing wow, what a great puzzle!  I didn't immediately care for the theme clue language until it dawned on me just how carefully and painstakingly constructed everything was.  True palindromes, every one.

I suspect they may be easier to craft than I think?  But they seem so daunting, and to meld them into an otherwise fine puzzle is like pleasant music.  Essentially zero ""filler"" too - even the Oreo clue isn't just another wedged Oreo.

Good (double) stuff.",20,positive,0.927588939666748
"How any times can you look at a typo and not see it?  How long can you stare at a finished puzzle that refuses to be acknowledged as done?  Well, sometimes it's about as long as takes to work all of the rest of the puzzle.  You know the word so well that you glide right over it again and again, until finally there it is: OREIDe.  ARRRRGH.

Clever puzzle, Jeff Chen, and tricky, even with the potentials for gimmes when the last letters of a long fill gave us the first letters and the other way around, but even so, KLAUS was pretty kinky. Thanks for all the good times you've given us, and do keep them coming.",23,negative,0.46830713748931885
"No slight to Joel, but where is Will Shortz?",2,neutral,0.8256542682647705
"I hope this doesn't hurt Pascal Siakam's feelings, but 36A made me immediately think of Caitlin Clark.

WNBA is popular these days! 119D, SUE Bird, no problem!

I quite enjoyed the puzzle. My Irish side is smiling.

I got it done early. I'm certain the Spanish will be smiling when Carlos Alcaraz wins Wimbledon and going totally NUTs when the national team beats England in the EURO 2024 championship. A busy day ahead!",8,positive,0.5032603740692139
"Holy Toledo!

I didn't notice the long answers were palindromes until I read Wordplay.

Absolutely stunning.",6,positive,0.7791256904602051
A wonderful build. I would‚Äôve loved to have been a fly on the wall as Jeff hit upon each of those theme answers.,5,positive,0.9801703691482544
"I loved the long palindromes, and they certainly made solving easy because as I got some of the letters on one side of the palindrome I knew where to place the same letters on the other side of the answer.  As a result it was a relatively quick Sunday for me, but I made a typo and had to squander more time searching for it than I would have liked.  That part of solving is where the fun leaches away.",12,positive,0.8930426836013794
"This was a fun puzzle.  My favorite clue - ""You might go for a spin in it."" 
 Where else can you enjoy all the puns while learning that luau actually means ""taro leaf?""  Thank you.",13,positive,0.9672734141349792
Delightful. Read the themed entries what felt like a hundred times while laying poolside. Had exactly one (1) drink and it all came to me! AC/DC broke it open for me. Could say it shook me all night long!,13,positive,0.9806118607521057
Fantastic puzzle! My first time solving a Sunday without resorting to google to finish it! The theme was a lot of fun to figure out :),14,positive,0.9849004745483398
"What a tremendously fun and creativity constructed puzzle! 

I have my Siri set to an Irish voice and something about it makes it more fun to use. And I always remember to thank her after each request so I am hopefully spared a violent death in the seemingly inevitable AI takeover.",15,positive,0.9488329887390137
"It took me 54 minutes to solve and it was very enjoyable.  After I saw that the first long clue was indeed spelled the same both ways, the other long clues were easier to solve.

Thank you Mr. Chen for an interesting and fun Sunday solve.",9,positive,0.9729251265525818
"It's a great day when the puzzle is by (or with) Jeff Chen. They're always well constructed and although this one was a bit easier than some of his others, the humor in the themers made this one very enjoyable.

Thanks, Jeff!",9,positive,0.9848926067352295

I loved this! It went smoothly with some snags here and there but I loved the theme! The phrases were so much fun to figure out. I‚Äôm in awe of the constructor!,8,positive,0.9887575507164001
"I always look forward to a Jeff Chen puzzle. Problem with palindromes is once you fill a few letters you have them in the other half as well which makes them incredibly easy to solve. So, less challenging than I would usually expect from him‚Äîbut no doubt these were still fresh and fun.",9,positive,0.9080248475074768
"Wow! Amazing construction. This went a bit quicker than usual for me thanks to the palindromic assistance, but I literally kept saying, ""Wow!"" 

A very impressive feat.",48,positive,0.9819934368133545
"I never heard of ARO, I had to look it up after I finished.
I was stuck on the [Possesive in the Lord's Prayer] - I had ""OUR"" which didn't fit anything.",2,neutral,0.4889141023159027
