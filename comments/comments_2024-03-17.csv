"While Simeon Siegel rightfully deserves the kudos he’s getting for this puzzle, let’s not overlook his good fortune in having the English language help him out. 

This concept requires that the four corners all have names of nine letters. I’m sure someone will correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe the equivalent words in Spanish are all eight letters — until you get to “sudeste” (southeast). (I haven’t looked at any other languages.)

But on top of that, the concept requires eight words that fall into pairs that can be given a single clue. For example, both PAT and PET have to be legitimate words — and you have to be able to write a clue that covers both. If any one of the eight words didn’t exist, this puzzle would not have worked.",3,positive,0.8374682664871216

I stumbled on the southwest theme entries, and could only think of the Okefenokee Swamp as a possible meeting places for crocs and gators, as I'd observed both species when my parents took us there as children. But then EPCOTCENTER exploded the whole National Park idea, so it took a while to sort the revealer out on the crossings. But what a nicely layered, nuanced puzzle. 

Loved that none of the theme answers touched the revealer. 

I wish, when if finally dawned on me, that the online puzzle would have let me discover all four of the alternative combinations on the crossings, but after WE and EA, it autofilled the NS and RU for me. Maybe I corrected another mistake somewhere else in the grid, and that's why it closed it out for me.

I didn't get the gimmick until I read Wordplay, as evidenced by my increasingly desperate justifications:  

OLDFAITHFUL in the southwest?! Well, maybe an east-centric mindset that refers to locales east of the Mississippi as ""Midwestern"" thinks of cowboyish Yellowstone and the Grand TETONs as southwestern?! Moving on...

Figured I'd circle back to see how to make Meteor CRATER fit somehow.

_FALLS that froze over just once, long ago? Well that sounds plausible for the southwest. But Havasupai doesn't fit... Maybe other falls in the Grand Canyon, Bryce, or Zion... I'll come back...

Lots of lightning strikes each year? Oh I'm sure the monsoons have a favorite target, not sure what is though...

Wait, what?! Alligators and Crocs? Ok, something really weird is happening...

I think my epiphany came once I saw EVERGLADES paralleled with EPCOTCENTER. Talk about an “aha” moment.

I vaguely remember seeing the store fronts in Manhattan when I walked around.

I guess that’s one of the caveats of having to use a rebus button. When I didn’t hear the happy music, I spent way too much time thinking I had entered 69-across incorrectly before going back and checking all my other entries. It was a good 20 minute slog. OTOH, I prevailed.

"For whatever reason, at a certain point I had enough of 69 Across filled in to decide that the answer was THE NORTH FACE. (Don't ask.) I had the rest of the puzzle done before I had to fly speck that area and came up with THE NORTH EAST, so I missed all the rebus-y alternatives.  Still it was a fun puzzle to solve with lots of little riddle-like clues scattered everywhere.  

The very last lightbulb that went off for me was why SEC was Brut-ish.  (French for dry in alcoholic beverages and dry for type of Champagne.)

Thanks Simeon. Looking forward to the next one.",8,neutral,0.5830349922180176
"I'm really tired now, but I'll relate that I did this puzzle on my phone while hosting a family dinner when the meal was taking a little longer than expected to cook and I could fit it in while participating in conversation.  And I correctly figured I'd be too tired to do it properly once the gathering was over.

It's too bad that I had to give so little attention to such a good puzzle.  I filled in THE SOUTHEAST with nary a thought of it, and figured that eventually, I'd figure out why all the theme answers were considered in THE SOUTHEAST.  

Imagine my surprise when I realized that it was a Schrödinger puzzle!  And the four quadrants of the nation could all fit in 69A.",18,neutral,0.4490339159965515
"This theme was a bit of a whoosh for me. I filled the grid with SOUTHEAST and just sort of shrugged off the theme entries that didn’t seem to fit. I had no idea what a short hedge meant, so I just tried final letters until the puzzle solved. I can see why people like this puzzle, but it’s not my cup of tea.",10,negative,0.6946668028831482
"Great puzzle. I feel guilty because I filled in ""the southeast"", which didn't make sense for all eight themers, heard the happy music, and got credit for the solve without seeing the need for the rebuses.",9,positive,0.4074672758579254
"Mr. Seigel had me guessing as to what the revealer until the very end of the solve. That's a fancy curveball, throwing in four rebuses to cover all four quadrants of the grid -- and the country.

Bonus entries appearing in the correct quadrants are San ANTONIO in the SW and ONTARIAN (crossing NIAGARA FALLS, no less), in the NE.",27,neutral,0.7512332797050476

"Face palm after reading the column!!

I started at the bottom of the grid and, exactly like Catlin, got EPCOT CENTER and  EVERGLADES.
Naturally, I filled in THE SOUTHEAST for the revealer.

I meandered all over the grid, and as I filled in the other themers, my rationale was that all of them were *really* in the Southeast because location can be relative. Mr. Seigel had not specified Southeast of what. 

Gosh, I feel like such a dork.
And, to be honest. I'm a bit sad that I missed out on the awed feeling during the solve.

But awed, I am. Even after the fact. 
It's a tour de force of astounding brilliance.

Mr. Seigel, you said you're thrilled to have this off your back after all these years.
Thank you for putting it on ours.

"I never caught on to the clever trick at the center of this one.  Despite noting that either HOUSE or HORSE might fit, I settled on HOUSE, and never considered the other potentially ambiguous down clues or the possibility of a rebus.  I ended up identifying THESOUTHEAST as the answer for 69A, even though it made no geographic sense and completed the puzzle none the wiser. I feel like I’ve done the constructor an injustice by solving in such an oblivious manner.  OTOH, if the puzzle had not accepted a one letter answer where the rebus was appropriate, the comments section would have been excruciating to read.",26,negative,0.5229640603065491
Awesome puzzle!  Tickled all my crossword needs.  One question though…the constructor notes refer to the original clue for 71 across. There IS no such entry…or are you just trying to lose us in the map one last time?,4,positive,0.6925184726715088
"I had 69A as THE NORTHEAST, biased as I live in MA, so until I read the column I thought maybe the sites were all in the Northeast of some area, so the Everglades are Northeast of the Keys for example. But that would be silly since everything is northeast of something I suppose. 

After reading the column my mind was blown. Just amazing. Before I read it I did notice the sites were situated on the grid according to their true geographic location.

A tour de force from Simeon Seigel!",12,neutral,0.7804205417633057

"The first attraction I solved was 4D (CRATER LAKE), which - combined with a bit of confirmation bias due to my location - seemingly made 69A a gimme as THE NORTHWEST.  Rather than question that logic as I solved the other locales, I rationalized that the constructor must be referring to the north(ern)/west(ern) hemispheres, and was content to leave it at that.  It was only when reading today's column that I discovered how much I'd missed.  To be not only epically myopic, but also to have deprived myself of enjoying what may be the best revealer I have yet seen, will go down as one of the great facepalm moments I have experienced in my time as a solver.",29,neutral,0.6433177590370178
"Nicely done. 
I solved using northwest, and scratched my head forever trying it tie it to the attractions.
If the rebus required both letters I would still be at it, so my gold star feels like a bit of a cheat. 
So very very clever.",8,positive,0.8074818253517151
"That was such a beautiful masterpiece, just like the geography of the US.  I’m sure everyone saw 2D and went to 69A to try to solve the rest - when Yellowstone didn’t fit then tried to solve the center. 

And voila, so many ways to answer just like dialects of the US. 

I adore how all the geography questions mapped to their area of the board. 

Cut LOOSE is my every travel goal. 

Thank you!",11,positive,0.9078830480575562
"An overly-elaborate feat of construction often goes hand in hand with the unfortunate byproduct of being a slog to solve, due to all the less-than-ideal fill that is usually needed to pull off the gimmick.

Not here, though. Wow. I've been solving the puzzle here every day for about a decade now, and I can't recall a better example of an amazing construction combined with tons of fresh clues/answers. I am in awe of this puzzle. Just an amazing job, all around!",95,negative,0.5576056838035583

"Absolutely brilliant puzzle! Oddly enough, my initial guess at 69A (with only OLD FAITHFUL filled in of the theme entries) was UNITED STATES.  As it turns out, that was the correct geographical location, but so many AHA moments to come along the way. First of all realizing that both NORTHWEST and NORTHEAST fit (I tend to solve from top to bottom), and then discovering that SOUTHWEST and SOUTHEAST also fit. I thought I had discovered it all until I read the column and realized that the locations were all placed in their appropriate geographic location. I am in awe!

"Like Patrick, I never had any conflicts in 69A and settled in with SOUTHEAST. So I was puzzled...so to speak. I did appreciate the geographically appropriate placement of the theme clues, but I had no idea why SOUTHEAST ""really"" fit all 8 answers, and then came here. Really brilliant, Simeon!

"Dang! Tiredness prevented me from spotting the Schrödingericity, even after I noticed it could be HOUSE or HORSE. Rats! Phooey! I feel I cheated myself out of that layer of genius.  Oh well, still fun to admire it afterward. Maybe I’ll redo this puzzle 10 years from now.

The striptease of this puzzle’s central revelation is one of the most masterful constructions I’ve seen in a while. First I had “the southeast,” then “the southwest” (“are there Everglades in the southwest?”), and then I realized that we really, really were all over the map.

A puzzle for the ages. Bravo!",104,neutral,0.45217210054397583
"Kicking myself. Could see that the revealer was a directional reference. However, with flies, in my part of the world if it isn’t a HOUSE fly it’s a blow fly.  HORSE flies just aren’t on my radar.

My apologies to the constructor and Schrödinger.",13,negative,0.5036213397979736
