"I enjoyed seeing GROK and GORP for quite different reasons. As others have noted, GROK is familiar to solvers of a certain age. When I was in high school, in the late 60s, someone would read Stranger in a Strange Land, recommend it with cultish enthusiasm to his or her friends, and before long everyone would be overusing GROK until it became tiresome. Half a century later the word remains fully part of my passive vocabulary but not, fortunately, part of my active one. I have a feeling that if I ever reread Stranger I would detest it now as much as I loved it then. GORP, on the other hand, is one of those terms that crossword puzzles rescue from the fraying edge of memory‚Äôs fabric. ‚ÄúOh yeah, I‚Äôve heard that before.‚Äù I appreciate that, and I resolve to use GORP (the word, not the substance) once today before letting it drift back to the periphery.",7,positive,0.7379293441772461

And the clues are as much fun as the answers.  I love the way the characteristics of BURLESQUE and JELLYFISH are summed up in two colorfully droll adjectives each.

Just a pure delight. Can there possibly be anyone who DIDN'T like this very breezy puzzle -- a puzzle that was so obviously meant to entertain us all?  I'll go find out now.",11,positive,0.9373165369033813
