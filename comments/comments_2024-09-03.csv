"A flotilla of frivolity! A lighthouse of levity! Are we on the HMS Pinafore here?

All seriousness aside, AS TO 41D: Sawyer for me is Tom's last name (to pick one instance) and I have never heard anyone referred to as a sawyer. Nor have I ever known anyone to set up a saw practice. An upscale term for cabinet maker? 

So, agent nouns. Worker, driver, teacher, dealer, seller, buyer, baker, puzzle solver, there are a lot of them. As an expat I find when I go to a restaurant the waiter always has to practice his English with me. Since it is a restaurant naturally the conversation will often have something to do with the kitchen. 

Many times I have had to explain that the person who does the cooking is the cook, not the cooker. I tell them it's a common mistake, and a perfectly logical one, but alas, it's wrong.

In Spanish nothing special happens with the cook. He's a cocinero. Or she's a cocinera. Does""ero"" in Spanish agent nouns have anything to do with ""er"" in English ones? I don't know!",10,positive,0.5989842414855957
