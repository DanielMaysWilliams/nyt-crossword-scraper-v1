"One about 44-down, “Ándale”. Is the Goya in this clue referring to the Spanish painter from the 19th century? If that’s the case, he spoke the Spanish language spoken in Spain. “Ándale” is a word only used in the Spanish language spoken in other countries, possibly Mexico, but it’s definitely not a word we ever use in Spain (some Spanish people might not even know what it means) so it’s a word Goya would never use or even understand back then.

 I'm a little surprised about the ENDUE comments. ENDUE is such a beautiful word, and to me, it seems very different from ENDow, even though they're often used interchangeably.

It's as if the person being ENDUEd with a quality is absorbing it from an atmoshere permeated with said quality as opposed to having something bestowed upon them.  I feel like I don't have the correct words to express what I mean, but maybe that's why we need both.",10,positive,0.8666559457778931

"I have a moderately humorous anecdote about the term SUCKING FACE. I'm ancient enough that I learned programming on a mainframe with punch cards. It was a great innovation when remote terminals came about and you could just type your programs directly into the Televideo 925.  No more handing over your punch cards to the ladies at the computer center! Yay! 

However, this did require having a logon ID and a password. In order to make my passwords memorable, I had a habit of making them rather... spicy, shall we say? The F word was a favorite ingredient. 

For some reason, I had not used the mainframe in a while and when I tried to log on, I could not remember my most recent password. This meant one thing: I had to go to the window in the computer center and ask the white-haired ladies at the window to retrieve my password for me. (Password security was rather lax back in those days...) I provided my ID and answered some questions and she ran off to look up my password. I did mention to her that my passwords were sometimes a bit on the salty side. When she returned, she looked at the slip of paper on which the password was written, and said, with great disgust "" You aren't kidding about having an offensive password"" and clucked at me once or twice. Another white-haired old lady asked ""What was it?"" Not wanting to say it out loud, lady 1 showed lady 2 the slip.

"I’m sure Seth and Jeff were bracing for the ENDUE comments. I have nothing to add except that my familiarity with Mexican Spanish gave me ANDALE. TIL that it is exclusive to Mexico and not Goya’s Spain. It has different connotations depending on the stress. A terse Andale (andalay) means Go! Quick! Let’s go! Come on!

"The expression”suck face” I first encountered in the film “On Golden Pond”, and any time I hear it I go back to that memory. Strange how things get linked in a brain.

Endue is a perfectly normal word. The only thing that makes words go extinct is not using them. If we live in fear of using any words outside of a core of twenty or thirty, we kill words. Think how boring the world would be, let alone the crossword puzzles, if we struck out all the words that somebody doesn’t know yet.",23,negative,0.4732397496700287

"I thought and thought and thought about what SUCKING FACE and TENNIS BRACELET* might possibly have in common and couldn't figure it out.  But by putting TWENTY-ONE fairly high up in the grid, the constructors didn't keep me in suspense for long.

"44D really bugged me. Goya is a Spanish painter. ""Ándale"" is an expression used mostly in Mexico. From a Spanish-Spanish perspective, ""ándale"" doesn't even make a lot of sense, for reasons I'm not going to go into here. ""Ándale"" is a Mexicanism. Mexican-Spanish pins a ""le"" on the end of a number of verbs and words derrived from verbs to express emphasis, surprise, agreement, disapproval, etc.

Cluing ""ándale"" with a reference to a Spanish painter is like cluing ""flat,"" as in ""apartment,"" with a reference to Whitman, or ""lassie"" with a reference to Rothko.

Further, as used most often by most Mexicans, ""ándale"" expresses agreement. ""Vale"" would be how Goya might have said the same thing, assuming colloquial use was the same back then as it is now. The idea that ""ándale"" means ""go, go, go"" comes mainly from Speedy Gonzalez.... (https://rescatedelesp.com/orale-andale-hijole-errores-o-regionalismos/)",46,negative,0.6109824180603027
