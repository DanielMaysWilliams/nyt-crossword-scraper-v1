"Today's is the first puzzle I completed since Tuesday. I was on a very busy week long work conference and I find it hard to puzzle in airports and airplanes. I prefer my quiet sanctuaries for puzzling. 

I used one lookup today. It was O'DAY. The Southwest was my last section. I had struggled through a few tough for me crossings but gotten them. I think if I weren't so tired, only getting back late last night, and were more patient I would have worked it out. I was semi confident of YALE but I kept going back and forth on SATAN or siren at 49A so I struggled to commit to anything. Once I plugged in O'DAY from my lookup, everything fell into place. Except my ego. I should have just come back to it later. I'm confident I would have been able to figure out the rest and fill in O'DAY from the crossings. Oh well, more time to catch up on the rest of my puzzles.

Kind of funny: I didn't notice I had the wrong tense for ASPIREs at 32A, so I had sON VITO for the Corleone clue at 33D... After no happy music, I caught that it was the wrong tense pretty quickly and fixed it. I have extremely little knowledge of the Godfather, sON VITO had made as much sense as anything to me at the moment! Briefly I had wondered if it was ALFREDO crossing ALFREDO. üòÇ I am so very tired!!

29A, Crepes often served with chutney
37A, Genoese sauces (ideally not used in the plural--constructor, please note: pluralizing abstract nouns may be common in puzzles, but it's off-putting)
39A, Classic tune used as in ice cream truck jingle, with ""the"": Around here, that would be Turkey in the Straw or Do You Know the Muffin Man
44A,  ___ bean (points for omitting the usual Hannibal Lecter allusion)
54A, Sauce made with Parmesan
21D (a stretch as to food), Person who consumes a ritual meal to absorb wrongdoings of the dead
32A, Steak often encrusted in sesame seeds
52A, Chain letters?

48D: That line from ""When I'm Sixty-Four"" is among my all-time favorite Beatles lyrics. It has struck me from the first time I heard it (i.e., when it was first released) as an insight into John Lennon's brilliance.

‚Ä¢ I like how NAMEDROPPED goes downward.
‚Ä¢ I also like the sing-song trio of ROMA / VERA / FAVA.  Try saying that five times fast.
‚Ä¢ ONE has appeared in crosswords well more than a thousand times, but never clued anything like the marvelous misdirecting [Small cube].  One of Ryan‚Äôs areas of study (at Carnegie Mellon) is math, so the clue doesn‚Äôt surprise me.

Ryan, your puzzle took me all over the place in a very enjoyable way, on top of a sweet uncovering of the squares.  A most entertaining outing toda -- thank you so much for making this!",53,positive,0.9465513825416565

"Solved about half the puzzle last night before I got stalled and fell asleep for about four hours. When I woke up I was able to finish without too much agony.  A good reminder that taking a break really does work. (Though sometimes hard to do.)
Like so many others, missed the Galaxies/ANDROIDS connection. And of course that is my phone.
Had to wait out the Apse/NAVE kealoa and had Bushel before SMOOCH. Loved the VERA clue.
All in all quite fun.",13,positive,0.8551816940307617
What a fun puzzle. Only hiccup was quickly dropping in ‚Äúsiren‚Äù for 49A. Thanks!,4,positive,0.977961003780365
"Another tough one for me, and I had to cheat a bit in some places, but managed to work it out. 

One clue history search today was for FAVA. As I half-expected it's twice been clued with a reference to 'Silence of the Lambs.' Somebody will that get. 

Interesting puzzle find today that I'll put in a reply.

"Even though I have a Samsung Galaxy tablet, it took reading the Wordplay column to get why ANDROIDS made sense.  ACH!

This was an enjoyable puzzle that scratched my Friday itch.  I had diE instead of ONE at 8D and had to think about why ONE made sense.  With __XES in place at 36D, I inexplicably put in voXES wondering why the answer was in Latin and thinking, ""Oh boy, the complaints are going to fly"" before I got SAXES.  I had AM I MAKING THis UP?, but Jezebel and SATAN put me on the correct path, which probably doesn't happen often.  

Nice puzzle, Ryan.  Have a great birthday!",15,positive,0.6953068971633911

"Nice puzzle but i prefer more wordplay. Because i solve on a phone for convenience, I am prone to fat-finger typos, which if i am not careful, I will not catch right away. In this puzzle i had a whopping three of these that survived to the end üò°. When one of these typos (ANDROoDS) crosses an unknown (to me) entry, it makes the flyspecking so much more difficult. Thus it took me a while to find all of the typos and finally realize it should be ROMA not ROMe, making AME_ crossing STY_E much easier to complete than when i had eME_.

Even after what felt like a very long time fly-specking, I still completed it almost 25% faster than average, so definitely on the easier side for me personally.",2,negative,0.46917247772216797

"Well that was tough. 32 minutes of grinding. I was a particular fan of the Oppenheimer clue. Ironic that my last two letters to fall were both Ds and required some guessing, as I'd never heard of either DIESIRAE or Rafael DEVERS.

"The ice cream truck song I grew up hearing (and heard as recently as last week) was Red Wing, which of course didn't fit the grid, but Red Wing was based on The HAPPYFARMER, so with ---------ER already entered, I confidently and incorrectly filled that in.

"I enjoyed this one, which I completed much faster than I thought I would when I started it.  Luckily, although there were many unfamiliar specific knowledge clues, there were also a number of clues on topics in my wheelhouse.  For the foodie in me there were some saucy clues (PESTOS and ALFREDO), as well as FAVA and DOSAS (delicious with a spicy mango chutney).  For the music lover in me STYNE, ODAY, DIESIRAE and AMEN were gimmes, and got me going.

The grid was quite interesting too. It seemed a little off kilter with the grid spanners not being symmetrical",19,positive,0.9736296534538269
