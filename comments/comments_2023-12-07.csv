"@Deb Amlen I'd have liked if the column had explained how to actually fill in the rebus. I'm sure it didn't occur to you at the time that the non-slash option was left out, but even explaining the options would have helped. I was reading the column thinking ""okay, but do I enter PB, AU, or both, and if both in what order?"" Maybe the introduction to rebuses explains it but having already gone through a rebus tutorial (which admittedly may or may not still be there for new solvers) I wasn't expecting to need *more* instruction in how to solve them.",20,neutral,0.7468132376670837
"@Deb Amlen I did not have to enter any slash. I solved using the Chrome browser. I only entered PB in each rebus square. When I entered my last square, the Congratulations page flashed on with all the correct PB/AU entries.",5,neutral,0.7047483325004578
"Hi @Wolf, There used to be, but given the huge variety of theme ideas, I’m not sure whether the rule — Across answers first, then the Downs — still holds. 

I can ask the editors and report back later, but I do know they appreciate solvers’ flexibility when the puzzle needs to be presented a different way.",11,neutral,0.7767500281333923
This is the first time I've seen a slash introduced intro a rebus. I would have solved it but for this.,31,neutral,0.47979769110679626
"Fun puzzle. Solved it (in a fashion) but how are we to know what to make the rebus? PBAU, PB-AU, PB AU were all tried. Then it felt like a silly chore. Is there a rule to these?",34,neutral,0.4241420328617096
Eyyy this is the first rebus I’ve solved all by myself.,45,positive,0.5810739994049072
"@Becca

Oop, I meant Ms. ""Amlen"", not ""Amblen"". Sorry Ms. A!

"My experience was pretty much the same as Nancy J’s (and Deb’s, don’t know why running the alphabet didn’t work for you? Gave up before X?)

Seeing RAP BATTLE/CAFE AU LAIT gave it away right away. I REALLY wish the editors had allowed Rebecca’s original clues! “Bust sculptor” is a reasonable misdirect. I enjoyed loomed/WOVE.

Definitely enjoyed the puzzle but I wish the editors wouldn’t take away good clues just to make the puzzles easier. Especially later in week. Gee, why not just write “the answer to 32 down is ‘make a u turn’ and to 50 across is ‘push up bra’” if you don’t want to use Rebecca’s better clues?",13,negative,0.5873496532440186
"In my dead tree solve the Sky Harbor clue was right under the grid so that was my first fill so - why not? - let's attack the revealer right off!  

As a result a nice smooth ride this morning.  Many thanks.   

Nice column Deb but a special hat tip for . . .

"Deb, curious as to why running the alphabet didn't work when you were missing only one letter",5,neutral,0.5276101231575012
I literally cannot get any combination of the rebus letters to work. Please send help! I’m on a 60  day streak!,11,negative,0.9057536125183105
"I figured out a rebus without reading the article! I put in PB/AU and it didn’t work…when I deleted /AU it immediately gave me my gold star. I was surprised to see that’s the way it was supposed to be based on my experience.

But holy emu I’m so excited!! Just over a year and it finally happened :-)

I solved the Thursday 12/07/2023 New York Times Daily Crossword in 25:47! It may even be my fastest Thursday too…guess I’ll check in a second after I make this comment. 

Oh and thanks for the PHX gimme!",23,neutral,0.44811877608299255
