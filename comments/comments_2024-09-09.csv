"Probably the wrong place, but I'm wondering why I pay for a yearly subscription.  In the last 3 weeks, I solved the puzzle,, got the congratulations, but also a blue star which remains.  In that span, this has happened at least 4 times all on different days,  

The last example was yesterday.  Yes, all tho non-credited puzzles are correct and it is irritating beyond belief.  Contacted support but have yet to receive an answer.  If you're going to sell a product, enough effort should be taken to make sure it works.",2,negative,0.5883445143699646
