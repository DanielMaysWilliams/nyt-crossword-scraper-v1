Appreciated another Toughened Up Tuesday puzzle though I wish it had been a little tougher.  Enjoyed the theme though.,2,positive,0.9740437269210815
"Hindi has not been the official language of India for decades. Even at the beginning of the constitution, English was recognized as an acceptable official language and then with the Eighth Schedule of the constitution, this was further expanded to include many more languages.  Today there are 23 languages recognized as official languages, i.e. languages to be utilized in the official legislative and judicial documents created by the Indian government. There is no national language in India as there are a 122 broadly spoken languages and over 1500 additional dialects. 

It is one of the most widely spoken languages in the country with about 44% of the population considering it to be a first, second or third language.",2,neutral,0.8466492295265198

"I enjoyed this puzzle, but I have to disagree with the clue for 1A.  The ""B"" in the answer indicates that we are dealing with a 4-point GPA, and the structure at the college where I teach -- and at every other college with which I have dealt -- sets a perfect A at 4.0 and a B from 3.0 to 3.9. On that scale, a B-plus would be higher than 3.5. An average grade of 3.3 would result in a B-minus.",2,neutral,0.5952368974685669
"Delightful puzzle, and mostly a breezy solve, but I got my knickers in a twist in the NE corner and it took me some time to get that sorted. I couldn‚Äôt remember BANH MI and held on to ‚Äúgala‚Äù way too long at 10A. But I got there. Thanks for the Tuesday fun, Mr. Larson and Ms. Ensz üòä",4,positive,0.670123279094696

"Another great puzzle! Good difficulty for a Tuesday in my opinion. BANHMI was a lovely addition and I also enjoyed FIGHTERFLIGHT and BABE.

I struggled immensely with the lower-middle section - I'd not heard of the terms SOUSED; SAUD and PGA didn't occur to me (I had PRO for a while), and IRAS was always bound to trouble me as a non-American, though I should've got it with ""Roth"". EGGO is something I've also not seen before, but fits well with the clue!

Thanks, Gary and Amy!",14,positive,0.9509392380714417

A tad is clued poorly, an atom and iota are much smaller. I don't enjoy these themes (is there a name for these?) but probably clicks for some.",0,negative,0.8106428980827332
"Some surprises today that made me realize I have been taking too much for granted. To wit: the smallest particle, in four letters, is not always iota or atom. ATAD (A TAD) messed up my SW for most of the game. Also, I had gala before BASH (well-deserved head slap) and I learned some new geography (KARASEA). That last took me to a map, to stare for a while and realize that I never really understood the part of the world that my ancestors are from. And not just that: my Rotary club supports students in Mongolia, and projects in some of the Stans... I took a long side trip into that map to understand the relationship of all these countries to which I have some sort of connection.

So....do we think no one wears petticoats any more?

So, now I know the name of a body of water north of Siberia.  My life is complete.  This is going to come in so very handy!  Not.

I'd like to indulge in more sarcasm, but yesterday's antics with the baby chainsaw DHubby got me have left me with tired, sore hands and wrists.  But you should see the brush pile!  I have big plans for when I can turn my attention to the ugly juniper that has been overrun by berry vines and crepe myrtle sprouting from roots....  

Oh, congrats to our constructors!  More, please.",11,neutral,0.3924030363559723

"When I saw constructor Larson‚Äôs name, my whole being brightened, because he brings humor and wordplay into his puzzles.  How can you not like a constructor who, in a former puzzle, came up with [Two things associated with Gene Simmons] for KISSANDMAKEUP?

I liked the breezy feel of filling this in.  In addition, I enjoyed the double-letter fest dominating column five (SEE, EGGO, ELL), the PuzzPair¬© of PROM and BASH, and the lovely answers B√ÅNH MI, PREEN, MOUSSE, and PROLIFIC.

Plus, I liked ORING as an echo of the theme, as the makers were playing around with the word OR in the theme, or OR-ing. 

ERUPTED crossing ALPS made me wonder if there are any volcanos in the Alps, and after a shallow dive into that question, I found that the answer is no, and for that matter, neither are there any in the Himalayas.  You‚Äôre welcome.

Congratulations, Amy, on your debut, and thank you once again, Gary, for your engaging cleverness.  This put me in a good mood and was a lovely springboard for the day!",43,positive,0.9436570405960083

"That was a lot of fun. Typical slow start for me, but finally caught on to the theme with PASSERFAIL and then guessing the other theme answers was the key to filling everything else in. Couldn't ask for anything more. 

Noticed that BOOMERBUST was not a debut answer, and... yep - this type of theme had been done once before - a Tuesday from October 19, 2010 by Fred Piscop. The other theme answers in that one:

"Forgive me if this has been said before (I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the first to think this!), but I was just musing that it would be really great to have stats showing how your average times for each day of the week have changed over time.

"Very nice THEME idea, Amy and Gary.  I was hoping to see constructor notes to see who did what, but they're missing today.  

A good BANH MI is a beautiful thing.  It's got everything you need.  Creamy crunchy sweet acid spicy salty umami goodness on bread.   It doesn't get much better than that.

I also want to congratulate Sam for taking over as the main writer for Gameplay.  More Sam is always good.",17,positive,0.9531922936439514

Hand up also for not knowing the sea and trying out iota before atom before A TAD. Phew, lots of TIL this morning.

A nice Tuesday workout before donning my rain gear to walk the dog. Yes, it‚Äôs raining here. Again.

I was held up for a bit at 67A as I had ATom there.  Took me a while to recheck all the acrosses then downs before I saw two words that could not be correct.
