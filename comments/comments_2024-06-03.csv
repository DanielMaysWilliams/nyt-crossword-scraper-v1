"When we are in Honduras, we eat a lot of freshly made nacatamales, which are more robust than tamales and I like them more. I wasn't sure if you spell them with a c or a k so I Googled it, which leads me to share that today I learned accidentally that one can purchase tamales in a can. 

Canned tamales exist.

I don't know what I'm going to do with this information so I think I might just take a nap.

I enjoyed the puzzle! A little slower for me than Mondays are these days, though still below my average. Today I also learned that  Messi has a first name! I sort of thought he was just Messi!

Past the last syllable of ‚Äútamal‚Äù;
And all our quesadillas have enticed diners
The way to salsa breath. Out, out brief condiment!
A tamale is but a steaming shadow, a poor imitation
That struts and frets its hour upon the plate

Backformed by boorish Yanquis, full of pork and corn meal

"Oh, marvelous Monday!

Often, for me, an experienced solver, Mondays fill in on auto, one reason being that I‚Äôve seen practically all the words in puzzles before, and many of them are clued as they‚Äôve been clued before.  But today, there are ten NYT answer debuts (Hi, @Rich!) ‚Äì Ten! ‚Äì each by definition carrying never-before-used clues.

Those debuts are in every corner as well as the middle, transforming the grid into a sea of spark. Lovely debut answers too, like BIG TIP, CHARCUTERIE, DUCK IN, and WOOD GRAIN

Those debut answers plus a few I didn‚Äôt know kept me fully engaged throughout.

Adding more engagement was trying to figure out the theme before uncovering the reveal, something I‚Äôm weak at and working on.  I did figure out that what connected the theme answers was BOARD (woo hoo!).  No, I didn‚Äôt get the ON THE, and I feel like I should have, but hey, small steps.

Bonus in this grid: Three appearances of the unusual letter string UTER, in UTERUS, CUTER, and CHARCUTERIE, not to mention CUTER crossing itself, beautifully at the T!

In sum, this puzzle, with its terrific theme and its AURA of wit and skill, kept me involved and delighted. Congratulations on your NYT debut, and brava Alana ‚Äì I am so hoping for more from you!",28,positive,0.9275162220001221

"Chile today and hot TAMALE. 

Nice puzzle and a cute theme - a bit of a workout for a Monday for me with a number of things not dawning on me from the clues, but everything worked out from the crosses (and a couple of googles). Back on a one day streak. 

Was really surprised to see that there were 10 debut answers - most of them pretty familiar terms or phrases, e.g. CHESSPIECE, BIGTIP, TRIPOUT, ONTHEBOARD, WOODGRAIN, COLDBREW. Furrowed brow. Oh well.

Looking forward to more from Ms. Platt.
