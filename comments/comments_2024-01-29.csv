"Fan of Engish language quirks that I am, this theme hit me in my sweet spot.

I am agog three ways:
1. That someone thought of this theme in the first place.
2. That these theme answers were generated.  How?  How do you come up with these?  
3. That not only were these theme answers begat, they fit the requirements of symmetry, with two pairs of 9s, and a pair of 7s.

So, wow!

I liked the theme echo of having three palindromes in the grid (DAD, LOL, OOO), not to mention the sing-song PAD / DAD / RAD in the middle area.  Plus, the PuzzPair¬© of TIE and SKOR.  

I also took a side trip to see if there were any palindromes I hadn‚Äôt heard before, and came across two that charmed me ‚Äì WAS IT A CAT I SAW, and the ponderous DO GEESE SEE GOD.

Where was I? Oh yeah - enjoyable Monday. A bit on the slow side for me with quite a few blanks on first pass, but catching on to the theme was a big turning point and that's always a nice touch.

First answer history search today was (of course) for other palindrome puzzles. It's been done a few times, but one quite notable one was a Tuesday from January 4, 2011 by David Hanson. In that one the reveal (15 letters) was:
PALINDROMICWORD with the clue:
""What every answer on the perimeter of this puzzle is.""

And the answers around the perimeter were things like:
DAD LEVEL SOLOS SIS REDDER TOOT TAT TENET MINIM...

As for Sunday... I  really enjoyed most of it. I briefly got sidetracked by Minecraft, but once I figured out the rebus trick it all fell into place. Mostly. I struggled in the middle left, so I put it aside for a while. When I came back to it after a good night's sleep I was able to finish, but I still had one letter wrong.
