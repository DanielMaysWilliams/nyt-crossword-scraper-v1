"Waow, what a nice puzzle! 

That NE was a bear. A sea of white for most of my solve, not helped one bit by sticking with 'handle' at 44A for waaaay too long!

My gut reaction at 14D was a simultaneous shudder-groan-eyeroll. A Nintendo game with a long name?? No way! 

Then in a flash I saw CROSSING through the mess I'd made of my [Deal with] problem and all became clear! 

This was cute _and_ fun _and_ interesting. Loved the clue for REINDEER. But what, no tigers?? Enjoy Princeton, Luke, but do bring us more puzzles!

FYI, I learned this as an undergrad: ""If all the matter in the universe except the NEMATODEs were swept away, our world would still be dimly recognizable...we would find its mountains, hills, valleys, rivers, lakes and oceans represented by a film of NEMATODEs."" Thus safety Nathan Augustus Cobb in 1914. I believe others have extended this to not just landforms, but all the living things on the planet -- even YOU! That is how ubiquitous NEMATODEs are. 

Apologies to those who replied to me after my problematic Acetabularia comment. I just saw your responses now. 

JohnWM: When I was a larval marine biologist, I was told that Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis was the second-longest Latin binomial in the animal world, the longest being some insect. I have no idea if that is true, and I don't want to find out either. But I have shared this probable factoid many times. I live in droebach territory now (""droebach"" is informal shorthand for these urchins) and I previously lived where Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Strongylocentrotus franciscanus were the local urchins. The latter two are much more visually appealing than our drab droebachs.

Animal crossword serendipity:

Just last night I did the puzzle by David Steinberg from Friday, 12 June 2015, which had at 49A [“B.C.” sound effect] = ZOT. When I solved that, I enjoyed the reminder of a cartoon anteater I haven’t seen in a few years. So, when the U.C.

I solved most of the puzzle before work, but not that corner. BARKER dawned on me when I was stuck in traffic on the way to the faculty. (I would take the metro and bus, honest, but it would take three times as long on this particular route, and it was too cold for a bike ride). That also gave me B of BNEG.

"NEMATODE was a gimme for me, and my first entry— although TIL that they exist even in the deepest oceans—  but I was unaware of the Nintendo game series and had no idea of the UC Irvine athlete. Unfortunately,  7D led me quickly to Pavlov doG for 18A, which fit nicely with the crossing G, and then I filled in buck for 22A— which fit with absolutely nothing! So I abandoned the North, and moved on down, where everything seemed straightforward and easy. I had CROSSING well before I returned to the North, corrected my mistake and filled in the ANIMAL. What was great about the puzzle was that the clues for all the crossings were so diverse that I never really noticed all those critters in the grid until I was able to fill in the name of the game!

"Opposable thumbs up! I like some of the vertical animals, too. The  numismatist for example would be an acceptable one. Or the aglet: a baby agle won't leave the nest until it learns to tie its shoes. And the dandy, a strange animal always wearing its FINEST. Monica Seles is often said to be one of the first women to popularize making rather animal-like sounds when striking the ball (and on the men's side possibly Gustavo Kuerten?) -- hoots, grunts, shrieks, moans -- now so common in tennis that the cacophony of the players (men or women) can sometimes drown out the crowd. I remember a final between Sharapova and Azarenka that sounded like postmodern atonal music for two voices. When you encounter a fairly silent player, like Iga Swiatek, the silence of their game can be eerie.  Anyway, do any of the cryptids from yesterday's puzzle count? Would you have accepted YETI?

We used to play a game with the kids we made up called ""The Animal Game"" - we'd each name a different animal til we had exhausted all we knew. At which point 2-year-old Jack contributed ""Living Toy?"" which made us howl, hoot and holler.
