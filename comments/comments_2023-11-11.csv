For 1A I was looking for a specific *kind* of snack (like ""Twinkie"") so I never fell into the ""Nabisco"" trap (though I'm familiar enough with 1984 that it would have been rejected pretty quickly after 2D anyway). I think my first instinct for 46A was ""ELEVATE"" which I immediately had to delete when 47A had the same clue with the same number of letters, and of course it quickly turned out my guess fit neither.

I filled the whole corner in, feeling quite pleased with myself, and what was awaiting me?  More of the same.

Rarely do I notice grid layout, except when all the sections are cut off from one another.  This was like solving four separate puzzles.

I knew Rudolph's signature feature, but not Pan's.  I knew PIGLET, but not HAGRID (I'm never going to remember you, sweetie, so don't hold your breath.)  I didn't know that W.E. Du Bois wrote love songs (were his as good as Joni Mitchell's?)

Yep - OLIVE was clued once as ""The other reindeer.""

"Quite a nice puzzle, even though I had to look up some trivia, beginning with HOSTESS - not having the first across answer makes the puzzle much harder, and most US food brands are unknown in Europe so I gave in to temptation and googled my way out of this conundrum (I know this is my problem as a foreigner who choses to solve American puzzles, but just imagine having to answer the following clue: '(Polish) snack brand founded in 1910.' You would Google it, would you not?). I also had to remind myself what mountebanks were, ditto mulligans. ANIL I have never before seen in my life. I mostly read non-fiction books, and when I do reach for fiction, it is on the lighter side, so I did not know the 2021 novel.

I had hOovEs for Pan's attribute, and since many letters out of that word worked with some of the other answers, or attempts at answers, it took me quite a while to realize the mistake. I slightly object to GOATEE in this context, since in ancient art Pan always has hooves, but as for his facial hair, sometimes he is shown with a full beard, often quite bushy, and sometimes with a goatee.

Yikes!  I should have remebered OCEANIA, but couldn't drag that up with the ""a"" from Nabisco as the first letter.  That one corner probably used more than 60% of my solving time.  ANIL and TINED went in right away, but the rest of that corner was vague enough that it actually felt a little hopeless for a bit.  Once I replaced Nabisco (I never should have put that in but it was the only brand I could think of) with HOSTESS, things started to move.

I have no idea what part of my brain some of the answers came from.  I'm looking at you, OCTAVIA and HAGRID. And because I had HAGRID, I got DIRTY WORDS, or was it the other way around?
