"The OBOE is NOT cylindrical. It is conical. It may appear cylindrical from a distance, but it is in fact significantly narrower at the top than at the bottom. This is one of the things, in addition to the double reed, that makes the oboe's sound so distinctive from the clarinet, which is actually cylindrical. The conical bore is also one of the reasons the oboe is such an expensive instrument. The wood - usually grenadilla, sometimes rosewood - has to be especially hard and well-aged to withstand the conical boring process. Here is a fascinating video on how an oboe is made. https://youtu.be/_xOj9bLkYVQ?si=D7SCdfB_pn09XYP9",7,neutral,0.7291712164878845

"Really enjoyed the puzzle! In case the constructors are reading and the puzzle pack for children's charities they mention was Grids for Kids, I'd also like to thank them for that!

I've been quite disappointed in crosswords designed for kids, as they tend to be badly made crosswords with clues that are intended to be easy. The amount of crossing is often very limited, and not respective of the relative difficulty of the clue/answer pairs involved in each part of the grid. Grids for Kids, however, was *terrific*. My son has never clicked with kids crosswords, as they tend to have these dead regions that he can't solve, but he raced through the whole Grids for Kids pack. That it involved donating to children's charities made the whole thing a real feel good affair, so thank you, constructors!",15,positive,0.9716914296150208

"Ohhhh!  A late puzzle find, completely unrelated to today's puzzle, but just one of the most amazing puzzles I can recall. I had actually done this one, but of course had completely forgotten it. Anyway... A Thursday puzzle from May 18, 2017 by Jacob Stulberg. 

In that one there were four rebus squares, but... it was a double rebus, with one part of it being used for the down answer and the other for the across answer. One example: 

35across answers was PLAY(CHICKEN) and the 'CHICKEN' rebus became 'ROAD' for 36d; the answer to that being (ROAD)RUNNER. 

And... the 'reveal' for the puzzle:

""Question raised by four squares in this puzzle?""
