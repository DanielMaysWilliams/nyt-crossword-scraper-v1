"I had to go back through the down clues to find the one about 1970's.  I got most of this puzzle w/o downs.  On that final run-through I noticed that my own city is the last down! 

I couldn't tell you about the difference between Miami and Miami Beach.  I've never been to either one.  But there is a huge difference between Palo Alto and East Palo Alto.  The former is upscale neighbor to Stanford University (which is it's own entity--not in PA).  The latter was formerly the 3rd world city of Silicon Valley, but becoming rapidly gentrified.  It is a different city in a different county than Palo Alto.  

So slight changes in names can make a big difference.",1,neutral,0.6927124261856079

"Oh, terrific theme!

I left the revealer blank after filling in all the theme answers, and dug in my heels, determined to figure it out.  I did see that I’M was atop the three theme answers, and kept thinking the reveal was I’M OVER ___.  But over what?  What do SNAKE, CLASS, and CINNAMON have in common?

Man, was I on the wrong track!  I finally uncled, filled in the revealer, and smiled at being so fairly beaten.  High respect to the constructor for presenting such a potent challenge to conquer, and for so excellently outwitting me.  I love being gotten like that.

I also love that DRY/EYES cross!

This is a Monday beauty, giving the new and newer solvers a good chance to succeed in filling the grid in, and introducing the concept of theme, which many newer solvers don’t realize that crosswords can have.  (I know this because I’ve taught many newer solvers in my crossword solving classes at an adjunct of UNC-Asheville).

So, here’s a puzzle perfect for the beginning solver and yet one that gave me, an experienced solver, a run for my money in trying to figure out the theme.  

When you can satisfy such a range of solver in a single grid, Malaika, you’ve made one special puzzle.  Brava, thank you, and forge on please!",28,positive,0.8928795456886292

"This was a trouble-free solve, except for leTS Be before SITSBY.

A very appealing puzzle, enjoyable, lively, and breezy.

Loved the picture, Sam! I stand by (gentle) flares alongside boot-cuts, pencils, and leggings. I still wear them with pride, hehe.

Something else that took me back to the 70's was 21D, the 1970 #1 hit. 
Funnily enough, though, it reminded me of a completely different song – Timmy Thomas singing 'Why Can't We Live Together.' 
It's an anti-war song that was a global hit in 1973 (when I was a 10-year-old living in flare pants!) and has been re-recorded by Steve Winwood (with Santana) and Sade.
