This came together faster than a usual Friday although I solved a few of the clues by sheer luck/guessing (not at all familiar with Minnesota locales or band leaders). So overall it felt enjoyable and not as daunting as it did at the start.,2,positive,0.9353993535041809

"This is the quickest I‚Äôve solved a puzzle of any day of the week since Fagliano became editor.  Maybe it‚Äôs just me, but I have found every puzzle harder.    

Not a bad thing, I guess. But I have a certain expectation for hard a puzzle will be (how long it should take) for a given day, that has been formed over the years. Joel is killing my confidence.  I thought I was a Friday level solver, but lately feel like I‚Äôm a Wednesday. 

I literally solved this faster than Tuesday.  

Solved bottom up. 
GATTACA may be dystopian. But I feel like that movie and handmaids tale are closer than we think. But before that, any dystopian movie about how water will be the ultimate natural resource. Cause that‚Äôs playing out right now in many parts of Latin America.",10,neutral,0.39222386479377747

"One could do worse than to pour yourself a little Jinro Soju and put on ""Golden Vibes"" (1959) where Lionel Hampton proves once and for all the legitimacy of the vibraphone as a solo instrument.

A good sweat, this puzzle, right? I had SPUR OF THE MOMENT rather than SOMETHING CAME UP -- and it felt good until it 
didn't. Ah well. I've only seen ""absolute unit"" to describe some physically large specimens.

"Breezy except for the NE. I haven‚Äôt watched TV news in many years, and I don‚Äôt think I have ever heard of 11d KATY Tur. FLAp for 8A ‚Äúblowback‚Äù made a little sense, but that left me trying to come up with a name that fit PA_Y. (18A Absolute UNIT is new to me, and while the T made sense, PAtY did not.)

"I had a hard time getting a toehold, but once I did I could work through it.  I'm not sure if it has harder than most Fridays or if I was just tired--it's been a long (productive, mostly good) day.  Lot of backing and erasing!

Seconding, thirding, or whatever that Thursday and Friday this week are much more fun than last week.  Today's twisted clues earn delighted groans when solved, not ""Um...well, maybe, I guess?""",5,positive,0.8366957902908325

What can I say about this, Kate Hawkins, except that I liked it A LOT, even though the mention of a FAULT LINE made me a little nervous because today, right now, is April 18, the anniversary of the 1906  magnitude 7.9, San Francisco earthquake.  Talk about an UPSET!",13,positive,0.8858693838119507

"I liked this puzzle a lot. Some might find it hard, but I absolutely shattered my Friday average with a solve time of 14:07, and that was with me setting the iPad down for a minute to send a DM to someone on my computer. 

It feels like feedback on all the garbage cluing has finally gotten through over the last few weeks. Most of the clues here were helpful in one way or another. Turns out when you don‚Äôt use Moon Logic or extremely tenuous connections to the answers the puzzle can be a fun AND fair challenge.

"The link in the column about Paul Sorvino's description of Saturday crosswords should not be skipped over.

It was to an essay written by Will Shortz in 2001 about how to solve a crossword puzzle.  In addition to the explanation of the weekly progression, it includes some of the basic rules, and is a great guide for newcomers.

It also mentions that the hints about how many words an entry contains disappeared in the 1950s, and mentions that the answer BANDB, as an example, should be parsed as (his words, not mine) ""three words"".

Got that, folks?  B is a word.  (So is N.)

It also includes the well-known line about what constitutes cheating, ''It's your puzzle. Solve it any way you want,'' which is properly attributed to Will Weng, an earlier NYT crossword editor.  The quote first appeared in an article written by Weng upon his retirement.

https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/27/archives/will-wengs-farewell-puzzle.html

(Many people think Shortz originally said it, and one commenter thought the other day that it's a Deb Amlem saying.)
