I got the Happy Music, then just stared at the grid, trying to see if there was a layer of wordplay I missed. Then I read the column.

What defines a silent letter? OK, the ""n"" in DAMN must be considered silent, as DAM WITH FAINT PRAISE would be pronounced the same (and, in fact, that's a spelling Noah Webster might have approved of)*. CINNAMON BRED would be pronounced the same with out an ""a"", but ""ea"" is such a common digraph in English that It's hard to consider the ""a""in ""bread"" (or ""eat"") a separate, silent letter. The ""t"" in HUSTLE isn't pronounced, but it--or a second ""s""--must be there, or else we would have a SIDE HOOSS-(or HYOOSS-)LE. Similarly, without the ""u"", in Modern English (or Spanish, or French), Tay-tay would sing about TEARS ON HER JEETAR (although variant spellings with ""gi-"" and even ""ghi-"" occur in the 17th c.). And, although the ""c"" in SCIENCE isn't exactly pronounced, it's so etymological that even in the 14th c. it was seldom dropped, and without it, one might mistake one's potato battery for a ZIONIST PROJECT. 

But I was vary proud of myself that I got TEARS ON MY GUITAR with just a few crosses, and a good nowlege of the tropes of Country Music!
