"Very nice debut Andy Walker. I enjoyed playing today. Lovely puzzle. Another Monday puzzle that proves the point that easy doesn't mean boring. 56A I especially thought this one was clever. I wonder how many remember the theme clue? I finished this one 1-1/2  minutes slower than my best time.  But as my grandson reminded me, I type slower these days. I also have fat finger syndrome, so there's that. These days my brain is faster than my fingers. Thank goodness for NYT puzzles that keep it so.

"Late to the party, despite my customary schedule, to wit:  general area of 2 a.m.: Spelling Bee until Genius Plus; Wordle; Connections; possibly Strands unless sleepy again.  
Annoying alarm at 6 a.m. Walking until about 7:30 in what passes for ""the cool of the morning"" (false advertising) followed by printing the puzzle and solving whilst receiving my cup of coffee with cream from DHubby.  

Today the departure from routine was a slightly rushed breakfast so DHubs could get to OT on time, setting my feet on the path to dishes, laundry, dust-mopping, and my own OT exercises for Ole Rightie  post-op.

That's right.... excitement!  Adventure!  scintillating conversation!  if the cat feels like it, that is.

I just sat down to check email and found the neglected  puzzle lying here, solved and designated for the recycling bin.  Belatedly picked up on the CLUB part of the debut puzzle--nice work, Andy!--but I'm with Twain on the subject of Golf.",7,neutral,0.7557428479194641

"Mondays are the only time I try to go for speed, so as usual I whizzed through it (for me) and was only vaguely aware of the theme. I got the food part but not being a golfer, I didn't notice the second part until Sam's column. 

I'm not WAFFLing on whether or not I liked it, it was a fun and fast one with a nice LEMON WEDGE to squeeze on my fried COD (yum) and a CHERRY on top (MEDUSA for ""Legendary stoner""). 

Still kind of an odd dining experience but who'd a thunk they'd put chocolate and peanut butter together until those two crazy jammin' kids ran into each other on the street one day!?

Couple of names I didn't know but got them easily on the crosses. Couple of slowdowns with colt before FOAL and tokyo before JAPAN. (I have no idea if they're actually in Japan or not, it's just what my fingers started typing.) Still, close to my Monday best. 

And Sam, I love that you told us you were cranky! Thanks for keeping it real with us... after all, we are hundreds of your closest friends!  

Besides, I've learned somewhere along the line that admitting I'm cranky almost immediately makes me far less cranky. It's like magic! Anyhow, I know you solved and wrote this before today so at least no one could have told you have a case of the Mondays.

"As a Monday should be... Not one lookup, cute theme, which didn't hit me until the revealer, and close to my best time. 

The theme though... not until I read Sam's column afterwards did I get the hole theme. (See what I did there?) The Diner's part I caught on to easily; the golf part was whoosh! over my head. And no wonder...before I had DINERSCLUB,  I tried MasterCharge (which, of course, didn't fit) and filled in MasterCard. Oops. But then I needed that D. And then the I.

"Clever theme!  The double meanings of the wordplay are wonderfully unexpected and I couldn't guess the revealer ahead of time.  I was sure the word GOLF would be in it somehow, but I was wrong.

So now I get to the revealer and I see ""credit card"" and I think of MASTERCARD and I think of the MASTER'S GOLF tournament.  Nope, wrong.  This is much, much better!

Even though it's a Monday-level puzzle, I can imagine the constructor leaping out of the bathtub shouting ""Eureka!"" as he realized he had three perfect theme answers and one perfect revealer -- and that they all had the necessary symmetry!

Very nice puzzle, Andy.",13,positive,0.9570941925048828

"Okay, I smiled at ""Legendary stoner?"" for MEDUSA.

Theme isn't AWFUL, but (to me) it LETSDOWN. I mean, who dines on a LEMON? Or a CHERRY? Or even a single WAFFLE? The connection between the revealer and the three themers seems pretty tenuous. Would SHOTPUTTER work too? I mean, maybe some folks ""dine"" on shots of alcohol?

Guessing that Hawaii is the state with no straight borders, since it has no (land) borders at all? 

As a mathematician, I'm tempted to say that no cusp point is an inflection point. That said, I entered CUSPS immediately upon reading the clue. I wonder when ""inflection point"" first appeared in general usage, and if that predates its technical usage in mathematics?

Should best leave the rest UNSAID.",8,neutral,0.553510844707489

One little nit I'd like to pick is 45A; having watched all 46 seasons of Survivor, I can only think of one season where contestants slept in a HUT, which was the season played in Gabon. Due to the risks posed by the wildlife, production built solid huts instead of having the contestants build their own structure. Otherwise the structure they sleep/lounge in has been referred to as simply ""the shelter"".",5,positive,0.7917861342430115

"To Sam--
Howdy, Neighbor!
Without filling in the revealer, I got that the second half of the theme entries had to do with golf clubs, but my first thought was that the first parts were the little icons that come up in slots machines. If I had spent more time in casinos I would have realized that waffles were not a common icon.

OTOH, waffles, and lemon meringue and cherry pies--sliced, plated, covered in plastic wrap, and on display in the Traulsen cooler--are common menu items in greasy-spoon DINERS. Along with eggs, and, if you stay around long enough for the lunch menu to kick in, cod fish 'n' chips. Although the one I frequent serves an excellent Blini Demidoff, and a half decent cup of latte.

Good weekend for keyboard technicians: by now, all our instruments should be in perfect intonation. (My guy uses something he calls ""Equal-beating Victorian Temperament."")",15,neutral,0.7855690717697144

That meant the reveal was almost the last thing I filled in. Nice 'ah, of course' moment. 

Looking forward to more from Mr. Walker. Had a fun puzzle find today that I'll put in a reply.

"Simple, elegant, worthy, never-done-before theme.  Bravo on that, Andy!

I tried guessing the revealer, as I like to do to add bite to the Monday solve.  I fill in the theme answers, leave the revealer blank, don‚Äôt read its clue, and see if I can figure it out.  It‚Äôs a skill I‚Äôm weak at, so I plug away at it.

Oh, I came so close!  I saw the golf connection, and actually figured out that the end of the revealer was CLUB.  But what kind of club had to do with food?  At one point I actually wondered if it was ‚ÄúEATERS CLUB‚Äù.  How close was that?  But, sigh, I gave up, revealed the first letter and immediately realized the right answer.  Oh well.  I feel progress.  Small steps.

Right in the middle of the Olympics, I did like seeing USA at the end of MEDUSA.  I also liked seeing WOOT which sorta echoed yesterday‚Äôs YEET.

And to honor your love of puns, Andy, I was happy to see that your puzzle has a PEEL.  At least for me.  Congratulations on your debut, and your theme is so lovely, I‚Äôm eager to see what you come up with next.  Thank you so much for making this!",21,positive,0.7880694270133972
"A cute puzzle, but I laughed aloud at the clue for Medusa. Few now read Ovidius Naso, though he tells of Medusa's violation by Poseidon in the temple of Athena.  As so often occurred in those myths, the violator goes unpunished while the violated is cursed. Medusa was originally a beautiful maiden, but Athena punishes her for the rape in the temple by turning her into a Gorgon. The redoubled violation seems a bit unfair. 

Best not to get into how her mirrored image somehow did not have the same astonishing effect as looking at her directly, as it makes no sense, whatever agency might have been involved. The willing suspension of disbelief, and all that. 

A troublingly tragic tale, when you think about it.",10,neutral,0.4584973156452179

"A worthy debut, Mr. Walker. Congratulations!

The puzzle was over much too soon, and only when I finished  did I go back and parse the theme. 

I've never dined on a LEMON or CHERRY, but I've (not infrequently) dined on chocolate. 
My proven dietary theory is that if you don't eat it in addition to a meal, but instead of a meal, the calories are the same.

I liked seeing ROOMBAS in the grid. In my family, we have a special fondness for ours and have even baptized them with names. 
My mom's is Cinderella, doing the cleaning while everyone rests. 
My own is Sir Lancelot, lord of the castle, hero of many a cleaning battle. 
That said, I still use my upright for the nitty gritty.
As you can see, I'm not at all anti-vacs.
