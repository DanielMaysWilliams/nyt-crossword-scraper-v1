"I liked this one a lot. It was witty! Didn’t take too long but very stuck in the Southwest and forgot James Baldwin was gay, but “as in” should have given me a clue to look that up!

"The theme was somewhat underwhelming, IMHO. The BRAILLEALPHABET is at least a specific (and interesting) thing, unlike a MICROSCOPESLIDE or a POCKETHARDDRIVE (which I've never heard of, despite being a bit of computing geek).

Frankly, today's Connections was more interesting. Let me it there.",8,neutral,0.4311799108982086

"Am I the only sailor here?  To moor a boat has nothing to do with a dock.  It's putting the boat on a mooring--one of those buoys you see out in the harbor. Putting it on a dock is docking your boat (and if you're a viking, you'd better dock it on the Port side, so you don't mess up your Starboard).  This is the second time I've seen it misused in the NYT crossword.

"Well, I knew I was no longer trendy,  but 62A proved it. Wish that could have been the column picture.

"Was the choice of BUY or paY a trap carefully laid at 10A?  I fell right into it and had a hard time getting 10D or 11D immediately thereafter.  My ""pearls"" looked for all the world like pOBA -- and I had no idea what that was.

Also, when I obtain something from logic, I DEDUCE (30D).  That blasted 2nd D made it look like the answer to the Tinder clue was going to be FIDO.  Which was perfectly silly.  But eventually I straightened everything out.

I enjoyed the resistance of a harder-than-usual Wednesday puzzle and I thought the revealer worked.  But I do have the sneaking suspicion that the idea for the puzzle occurred to the constructors first -- and that they then set about finding a revealer for it.  (I have no idea whatsoever why I think that.)  Anyway, a very nice Wednesday.",8,negative,0.4535312354564667

"John DEERE dealerships are thick on the ground in these parts.  My recent visit from brother Ric and his lady-friend had an entertaining moment (as they were exclaiming in shock that MS does not have a Trader Joe anywhere in the state) was the revelation that the population of Mississippi is 3 million.  (Their neighborhood in NoVA is larger than that.  Okay, I lied.  It's 2.9 million.  

Having started down in the SW, I solved bottom up and had a few ""What?"" moments.  Is there really such a thing as a POCKET HARD DRIVE?  And how is ""gets along well"" translated into GELS, which I would have clued as ""comes together"" or ""forms into"".....?  I guess I see it...dimly....

Well, on with the day!  Likely to be late to the party tomorrow, as I have fasting LABS to start my day--woo hoo--followed by Annual Wellness, followed by a DexaScan, and somewhere in there a HAIRCUT.  I hope I can stand the excitement.  All y'all behave.",8,neutral,0.5495465993881226

"Nice Wednesday puzzle. The theme was clever and funny. I had my suspicions about 1A, and sure enough, there was no cake or ice cream involved. The ""space buns"" clue brought a smile. Only one lookup. 

This was a terrific contrast to Wednesday puzzles that are too difficult to be fun. Some tricky clues, but most of the answers only required general knowledge.

Let's have more verbal music from Husic!",6,positive,0.948552131652832
"This one was a really good example of what I think I’ve said before—the puzzles seem to be getting easier…until they aren’t.

"I once thought that the growing use of DOULA in crosswords was evidence of recognition of our profession. As a solver, though, I realize it’s got more to do with vowels, and handy consonants.

"Did anyone catch the concurrence of DEV and PATEL?

Re: DOULA--if this word is questionable because of its etymology, it's not the fault of the constructor, who is merely applying a brilliant clue to what is now a common and tacitly accepted word. Rather, it is the fault of the culture that adopted it.",7,neutral,0.6460467576980591

"In my print version the tractor tag line sat right at top center so I jumped in there and solved bottom up, including the reveal.  Big mistake.  

Just like the DEGREEs my level of achievement diminished as I moved up and I did not catch on until I reached the first tier.   Oh well, still good fun.   

Many thanks.  Going to put on that Dylan song . . .

"Tough one for me, and must confess that I had to stop and ponder for a bit even after I filled everything in to entirely grasp the theme. No complaint - that's all on me. 

Puzzle find today - with my compulsive letter counting, it dawned on me this morning that:

ITSRAININGCATSANDDOGS

is 21 letters. And... it was an answer once. It was the 'reveal' in a Sunday puzzle from January 5, 2012 by Finn Vigeland with the title: ""Weather report."" The other theme answers were all downs, with scattered letters in them highlighted. A couple of examples (capitalizing the highlighted letters): 

CAblesItCOms - (CALICO)
BrEAkinGtheruLEs  - (BEAGLE)
MAsoNdiXonline  - (MANX)

"This might be the first time ever, in four years of solving crosswords, that I breezed through a puzzle by Matthew Stock and Brooke Husic.

I'm stoked!

It didn't start out that way, of course, as I skimmed the clues and only got a toe-hold in the lower center, with RIO and DODO. 
And I just realized that it does indeed say something about me! – I do, after all, have a foot in (another) Rio, and I can attest to being  a dodo sometimes (case in point, how I had almost finished the puzzle before I caught on to the gimmick.)

I truly had a blast with this solve and how it seamlessly opened up.

Thank you, Matthew and Brooke!
You both are truly ICONIC.",15,positive,0.9762877225875854
