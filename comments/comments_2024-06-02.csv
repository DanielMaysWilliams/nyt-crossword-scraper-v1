This was a wonderful puzzle, totally on my wavelength.
 of the same thing here.  And I love Wacky Woprdies, and their cousins.  There's a lot of that kind of thing too.  Thank you.

Having spent several decades as an editor, and doing copy editing and marking up copy for the typesetters, this puzzle was just a joy.

Thank you, young man.  I look forward to moe of the same.  But, of course, the typographical norms will have changed by the time you have graduated college.  I hope you come up with the changes, and continue to bend them to your puzzling endevavors.

Thanks for the fun!",4,positive,0.9606575965881348

"I liked this puzzle a lot. Lots of charm and wit and playfulness and a fun theme. It was so good and fresh and high quality that I don't mind the green paint of TVTAPE.

Today I've been dealing with securing an AMTRAK reservation for a month from now, along with lots of Amtrak customer service and system errors so I'm late with this comment, but I thought I'd try my hand at the theme, these aren't necessarily ""keyboard/ typing""-related as Constructor Luke Schreiber's were but here goes anyway:

"I started playing the NYT Crossword two years ago today. It’s been an amazing ride and has become a great hobby.  I've learned an amazing amount. It’s helping my memory. In fact, I may be transmogrifying into an elephant. 

I don’t know how my progress compares to other newcomers, but I can now finish Mondays and Tuesdays without looking anything up. Mostly. Also: I like to write sentences that only contain adverbs.   My record for Mondays is 7:56.  

I can usually knock out a Wednesday puzzle inside an hour. 

Thursdays are fun but success is very hit or miss. 

I’ve never solved a Friday (other than Easy Mode), or a Saturday or Sunday. So it goes. 

One thing I’ve noticed is that I don’t always pick up on some of the wordplay.  That seems weird since I like plays on words or, as they say in English-speaking countries, puns. 

The gimmicks often confuse me. I’m not sure if it’s just the way my mind works, or if it’s because I prefer small shiny objects. 

It’s been a fun ride that’s not over.  Peace.",13,positive,0.9668574333190918
"""No one has said 'Mucker,' ever,"" said I.

""Well, actually they have,"" said the OED, then hanidly gave me a dozen or more different usages, grouped under four noun and two verb entries (""I mucker, you mucker, he, she, or it muckers . . .they will have been muckered"".  Most are described as dial., obs., or slang, and include references to members of a 19th c. German Theosophical sect, and a portmanteau for an expression of which the emus would not approve. The first person to be described as a ""mucker,"" in the sense of the clue, was a 13th c. professional mucker by the name of Ralph. How do they know?

As nits go, though, that's a truly tiny one to pick in an otherwise fun and engaging puzzle.

I thought I saw the theme as soon as I saw the Marks, then went on a wild goose chase for other kinds of punctuation (COMMAS?  PERIODS?). CUTOFFJEANS and LONGJOHNS cured me of that idea.

"We still have a treasured library of VHS tapes made from TV programs, movies, PBS shows and series, many of which are unavailable anywhere else.  Some turn up on YouTube, but commercial VHS tapes and DVDs almost always have changes from the originals we taped (scenes missing or changed from ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" and ""Smiley's People,"" music substituted for the original in ""Love at First Bite,"" etc.—we have compared them), and Barry Humphries shows, a train journey across India beautifully narrated by Brian Thompson, a ballet retrospective series where I first saw a brief clip of Pina Bausch dancing, before I and many other Americans had ever heard of her (I instantly became a passionate fan and saw productions here and in Paris), the original Jane Torvill and Christopher Dean ""Bolero"" skate, ""Enchanted April,"" ""Love in a Cold Climate."" Much of this can be found somewhere or other, but we have TV TAPEs in an upstairs bookcase, and we call them TV TAPES, meaning we taped them from our TV and play them on a VCR.

Many have drawn parallels between Sideshow Bob and Grammer’s similar portrayal of Dr. Frasier Crane in Cheers and Frasier. Of note, in that latter show Frasier had a younger brother Dr. Niles Crane portrayed by David Hyde Pierce. Seems in The Simpsons, Sideshow Bob had a brother CECIL, voiced by no other than Pierce.

I knew it couldn't be Han for solo but I wasn't sure what it was. I am a big fan of hope but I did not know those two before. 

The theme answers were filled in very quickly and I finished the puzzle in less than half my average time for Sunday. 

I'd like to join the chorus regarding TV TAPE. Yikes! Yesterday, I couldn't believe opera ROCK was not the answer up in the northeast and today I couldn't believe that TV TAPES was the answer....  😂  For a second I wondered if there was a rebus so I could fit in either vhs, video, or beta TAPE. Again I say, yikes!

Kind of felt the same way about the MTWTF abbreviation for work week and WEAR IN...  And kind of felt the same way about a number of non-theme answers, actually. But I shall not belabor it. It is always an enjoyable privilege to do a crossword puzzle, especially on a day that I could relax into it. 

I particularly liked SPLICED GENES and CAR WASHES! And I enjoyed seeing Willa Cather show up, even if I am more familiar with My Antonia, which I still have a copy of from the way back.

"Now this is what I come to Sunday NYT crosswords for. A many-layered solve for me. 

First, it took awhile to get the theme. Then there were multiple places I had to just stop and stare awhile at the fill, waiting for something to come to mind. The most challenging was at the end, when there were two different squares I was not sure of. One I was reasonably sure of, but the other, the cross of 65D and 74A, I had no clue.

The resolution was one of those times when long frustration explodes into glee. After staring at that square for awhile, trying some different letters to see if anything triggered an idea, finally I tried an N. Whereupon the clouds parted and I saw that my real mistake was actually in 70A, where I had BUCKSAW. (Severe social media punishment: BUC? BUN? BUL?)

Just had to come here and say how much I enjoyed this solve.",9,neutral,0.5772209763526917

Mom and Dad often had a sitter for us kids when there was a ""Hail and Farewell"" dinner at the Officers' Club.  This custom is ongoing and must date back to the days of centurians...  who would say ""AVE""--meaning HAIL, not FAREWELL.  I hope I'm the 100th to bring this to your attention.

The fill was very entertaining and had us stopping to groan and/or laugh all the time. I thought it was Shania TWAIN but luckily I solve with my genius and cultured girlfriend who reminded me about Mark TWAIN. But it's okay because I'm the sporty one who taught her it wasn't Han SOLO, but Hope SOLO. I also always for some unknown reason confuse Resivoir Dogs and The Usual Suspects.

For a high school senior to come up with this sophisticated, clever, imaginative, varied and thoroughly grown-up puzzle is astounding to me. Every themer clue was a delightful little puzzle in itself -- and it was great fun to figure out every single one of them.

And the grid is so wonderfully free of the kinds of things we're told that today's high-schoolers are so completely into.  There's almost no pop culture at all, few proper names, nothing having anything to do with screens or textspeak or anything of that ilk.  If I see a hint of the constructor's special interest, it might be in solving the problems of climate change -- to which I say Bravo!

But that NE corner seemed to take as much time as the rest of the grid. I’m sorry, but 21A TV TAPE is green paint. The correct term is videotape. My undergrad degree was in Radio-TV-Film, but I mostly studied TV production. 

24A WEAR IN is also suspect to my ear. You “break in” shoes and you wear clothes, especially jeans, until they’re nice and soft. But “wear in”? (Confession: Most of my clothes are past being worn in and are virtually worn out.)

I hate trying to make sense of long Down answers, and what little I knew about 15D O PIONEERS! didn’t have the setting any more specific than “the American Midwest.” So I had a difficult time making sense of that. 

But even after fixing the NE corner, I still had an error. I finally saw that 77A wasn’t YES It is but YES I DID. That’s what I get for not checking 62D IN A DEAD HEAT. (55D SALADIN didn’t look too wrong with a T instead of a D.)

A few years ago, I put on a denim jacket that I hadn’t worn in a while. In the pocket, I found a ticket stub from an arthouse cinema here that closed around 20 years ago. It didn’t say what movie we saw (and we saw a lot of movies there in the 1980s and ’90s). My husband thinks it might have been an installment of Matthew Barney’s “Cremaster” cycle.",12,neutral,0.6317565441131592

"Boy was I on the same wavelength as the constructor. It took maybe 5 seconds to come up with QUOTATIONMARKS and then I did all the rest of the theme clues just as fast, except for DASHEDHOPES, which I had to figure out from the crosses (the hopes part anyway, the dashed was also obvious to me). 

Still didn't make my PB, though. After that flying start, the rest was still a challenge. Fun puzzle.",9,neutral,0.4947494864463806
"MY ANTONIA, by Cather, also takes place in Nebraska & has the same letter count as O PIONEERS. Which is neither here nor there. Come to think of it, that might be a good state motto for Nebraska: ""Neither Here Nor There."" OK, Cornhuskers, back down: I kid. 

Loved the theme set and some of the excellent clues, especially Auto Refreshes ---> CARWASHES. Love how in the past few years we've seen some teen puzzlemakers of great ability -- Mr. Chalfin comes to mind.

"I truly enjoyed this puzzle. Mr. Schreiber made me fight for every inch of real estate, especially in the upper right section with the binary and decimal look-alikes and the AUTO REFRESHES ? punny clue. There really seemed to be no “filler” clues with each one being thoughtfully crafted. I particularly liked the theme clues because each was like a puzzle within a puzzle and the answer could be reasoned out rather than retrieved from memory. This puzzle took a bit longer than my Sunday average, but I enjoyed every minute. Thanks for a good and fun challenge.",24,positive,0.9592486023902893

"I'm sure there are some who solved this puzzle in seven minutes but I thought it was very hard. I had to come back to it again and again.

"DONT YOU love it when the fills reveal the clues and make you laugh?  I could use a month of Sundays like this one, a SERENE solve that SOOTHES my SEISMic nerves—just enough SPINS to make me take a few steps back, but no DASHED HOPES.  Looked BACK, SAW I had to abandon my fez and put on a TAJ, (a word I only thought of with Mahal —""YES I DID""), and never noticed before that ""My Antonia"" has the same number of letters as ""O PIONEERS."" But ""IT IS SO"" satisfying when I see what TRIPS me up and I say ""AH I SEE"" (even though I like your answer better). 

Ever see so many QUOTATION MARKS??

"TV Tape?  TV Tape?  I mostly enjoyed this puzzle but that is one of the most awkward answers I've ever seen.  VCR medium is TV Tape.  Wow.

Pros:

Nice, fun theme that revealed itself right on time after minimal confusion.

Glam rock is a great clue.

Overall a well made puzzle.

Cons:

Who the heck is Buck O'Neil?  (Sigh, sports guy of course.  I would have preferred Buck Owens or something.)

TV TAPE!
