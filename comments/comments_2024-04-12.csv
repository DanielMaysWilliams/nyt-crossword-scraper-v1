Like, doesn't every single person who celebrates Thanksgiving have mashed potatoes‚Äîand most have stuffing too!? I informed him of these facts (har!) he said they always had potato salad (the mayo based one). I was like, noooo, potato salad is for the 4th of July!

Confession: BLANKET HOG probably wouldn't have come in if I hadn't cheated on SEGEL.  Once again, I was following the Nancy Rule [TM]: Cheat only when you're really, really enjoying a puzzle and have hit a wall so that you can't continue with the puzzle that you're so enjoying unless you cheat.

A tough puzzle -- with the toughness coming from fiendish cluing and occasionally from vague cluing, but not from a boatload of mindless trivia.

One question: Just how many prize-winning CURIE scientists are there out there anyway?

"Fair and tough puzzle for a Friday or, as it‚Äôs said in Portugal, seixta-feira. 

Got FIAT and ALFA right away but I wanted to enter Audi and Saab so badly because I thought they‚Äôd end up being the correct answers.

Had PRICEhike for a long time until DROP made sense. If you use Google fare alerts for a trip you are considering, Deb, you do see price DROPs. That‚Äôs the time to *buy* and then HOLLA to your friends so they can buy now, too!

Have a fun Friday, y‚Äôall!",8,neutral,0.5000818967819214
"Pretty good! I can‚Äôt be the only one who has never heard of TEXASTOAST and spent ages trying to find the error, while sitting on ‚ÄúTexan‚Äù and ‚ÄúMTN‚Äù instead of MTS.

Nice stacks of 9s and 10s! The three-letter entries were scarce and also clustered near the center.,8,positive,0.9080936908721924
"I really liked this puzzle. I made tough but steady progress over the course of a ~45 minute solve. 

In each quadrant I began with really promising fill that I eventually had to go back and delete / rethink. 

When that happens, and the replacement answer is worse than my first (incorrect) response, it‚Äôs always disappointing. That was not at all the case this evening. Loved the challenge, loved the clues and really loved the fill.

Hearty thanks and a job well done to Evan Kalish!",12,positive,0.9383682608604431

"The early returns seem to imply that NW was the hardest to fill... I was stumped longest on NE... everything North of Broncos took me a while to figure.  Didn't help that one of the only answers I entered on the first pass through the puzzle was WANE for 16A.

The section I finished next to last was NW, but COHABIT unlocked that whole section for me.

I'm also on team skeptical of COB as Turkey Day detritus and I started with PACKERS for the NFL team.

With all the errors and the tricky top of the puzzle, this was a good crunchy Friday challenge.",10,neutral,0.610659658908844

Seventy years ago our family name for this treat was ‚ÄúFrench toast‚Äù. No idea about how widespread this usage was. 
A preferred form was made with (unstrained) beef dripping.

I like the RAIN DANCE  clue  ‚ÄúRitual performed to break a spell‚Äù, which reminded me of our spell break theme earlier this week. 

Lots of clever wordplay, as hoped for in a Friday puzzle.

A great start to the weekend.",18,positive,0.7347047924995422
