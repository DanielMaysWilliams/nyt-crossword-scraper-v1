Was surprised no Constructor Comments so here they are from xwordinfo:

""It's been quite a journey to get here, to my debut puzzle published in the New York Times. After being an avid crossword solver for over 40 years, I decided to try my hand at constructing (like many other recent debut constructors) in early 2020, when so many of us were sentenced to ""House arrest""! It took me quite a few submissions before I was able to catch the editors' eyes with today's theme, but now that I have my foot (or at least a toe) in the door, I'm hoping to get some of my other ideas noticed for future puzzles.

I have to give a big shout-out to my husband, Larry Lichens, for getting me started and guiding me through some of the nuances of grid design and fill techniques. Also, many thanks to Tracy Bennett at the Times for shepherding me through the process, helping to smooth out the rough edges of my initial submission, and getting this up to NYT publication standards. Hope everyone enjoyed it.""",7,positive,0.8628109693527222
"Beat my average solve time by 7%.   Had trouble parsing 16A and getting comfortable that the answer I had was actually correct.

"I love the concept.  I don’t remember ever seeing this theme before – answers consisting of two-letter words.  I also see a wink in this theme, as two-letter words are generally verboten as crossword answers.  Original and a bit rebellious – my kind of theme!

First thing I did, crossnerd that I am, was look for other answers in the grid that could be broken into two-letter-word sentences, and couldn’t find a one.  So, more points here for elegance.  

OH NO EW HE IS MY EX is classic, worth the price of admission.

The constructor says in her notes that she’s been avidly solving crosswords for more than 40 years, started making puzzles in 2020, and went through a number of rejections before this puzzle caught the editors’ eyes.

Overall, while I definitely admire the constructors skill, it left me a little underwhelmed.

Edit: it was only whilst writing my post that I realised why: the whole, two letter word response thing is how my SCREENAGE kids would speak. As a Boomer myself and a self confessed grammar pedant, it used to drive me insane. ‘FGS, Use words of more than one syllable when you speak to me’ was a common refrain in our household.

I'm ashamed to say that even at that age I was a bit of a purist, a grammar-prig, and I was outraged by this gift. ""Will they abridge his name to Rob Cru for the duration of this book?"" I exclaimed hot, hot, hotly. Actually, while the authors did endeavor to keep the words to one syllable, if forced to employ a polysyllabic word they'd hyphenate between each syllable.

You should try his  ""hell & brimstone"" ribs.
