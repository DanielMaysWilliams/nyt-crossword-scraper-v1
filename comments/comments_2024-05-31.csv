"Okay, once again the crossword is teaching me words I'd better get used to because they're here, they're coming at me, and even if they were contrived to fill a fill, I will no doubt see them again. UBERIZE? GAMIFY? 

I do a lot of FIENDING, even if I didn't know the word for it before, and it is one that I am happy to welcome; SICK and DOPE seem to be trudging into a language that now uses negative antonyms to express admiration and were not entirely unknown to me; GAMIFY is rather sweet; but UBERIZE? I'm still trying to figure out how to use that one.

Altogether, they added a challenging spriteliness to an otherwise medium-tough, solid, well crafted puzzle, and as someone who learned the word (blush blush) ""meme"" from a crossword, they are helping me to navigate this first quarter of a century that I'm still trying to get used to.

There's been a lot of chatter today concerning the confusion and differences between mandarins and clementine. But the biological taxonomy of not just those two, but *all* the citrus fruits--oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruit--is incredibly complex, with a great amount of natural hybridization and domestic cross-breeding. It appears that most of the fruit we eat today are based on three original wild species: Citrus maxima, C. medica, and C. reticulata. True mandarins are as close to pure C. reticulata as one is likely to taste. All navel oranges are based on cuttings (and therefore, clones) from an original mutation discovered in Portugal (or Brazil?) around 1819.

"I appreciated the inclusion of modern lingo like GAMIFY and UBERIZE  (at 45 years old, I can't say I've heard the latter term used anywhere, yet could still parse the meaning of it).

It's an especially wide range for a teenage constructor.
However, I must dispute the clue for SERENADED. 
It's simply not what the word means, and is far too vague. 

""Opera lovers"" either attend operas or listen to recordings of operas, but are (generally) not  being SERENADED, as per the meaning of the word.

The word is also not exclusive to Opera, nor any musical style or form ‚Äîthough there is loose form of composition referred to as a ""serenade"". And that's verrrry loose. 

If Rolando Villazon walked into my kitchen today and sang ""Una Furtiva Lagrima"" TO ME and specifically FOR me, well heck, yes I would indeed be being SERENADED.

I personally felt that was a particularly lazy attempt at clueing, considering one might just as easily say ""Like many (insert genre) lovers"". 
""Like many opera lovers"" made me think OLDANDRICH, ARTSNOBS, DYINGOFF, DRAMAPRONE, among many others (I know those don't fit, it's just what popped into my head). 
I got to SERENAD- with the crosses, and was really hoping it wasn't ED.

That aside, my only other gripe is that it felt slightly too easy for a Friday. 

It's an impressive debut nonetheless. How many constructors debut on a Friday?! (Seriously, are there stats on that?)

"In our household, a large percentage of our grocery dollar becomes money put into the hands of the heirs of billionaire brothers Theo and Karl Albrecht (well, technically just Karl's, since all the American stores are part of Aldi S√ºd).

I just finished up half of a Fruits of the Forest one while I solved this puzzle.

As we know, much of Aldi's branding and labeling is designed to suggest the name brand products they're copying. My favorite was Boot Tread--no longer available--an imported Belgian brown . ale whose labeling was intended to suggest the popular Fat Tire. Now Fat Tire is a ""Belgian-style"" ale, brewed in Fort Collins, Colorado. In other words, Boot Tread is a knock-off of a knock-off.

My Partner loves a bit of fresh fruit with his breakfast, and for a long time he would come home from Aldi and exclaim ""I got two bags of nectarines! They were on sale!""--nectarines? they're not even in season!--eventually I realized he meant clementines.

"I found this to be a mostly smooth and interesting solve, though I did struggle for a bit in the NE corner. I had DNA swab, and the crossing of GAMIFY and FIENDING wasn't helping.

I think this was a great debut,and I am impressed and glad to see the talent of the next generation of crossword constructors.  :)",10,positive,0.8520375490188599
"Glad to see another new constructor; looking forward to more from Mr. Deshong. I couldn't complete this one; just couldn't get enough of a toehold anywhere to work it out. That's all on me. 

One answer history search today was for MAILER. I've come across things like this before - the clues for it just changed almost entirely from pre-Shortz to Shortz era. Pre-Shortz it was ALWAYS clued to the author. In the Shortz era it was clued that way twice, but every other appearance referenced an envelope in one way or another. 

A couple of interesting puzzle finds today; I'll put those in a reply.

"I thought this was a solid puzzle with some quirky neologisms that were fun to puzzle out.  I tried nunnery before the crosses led me to NUNHOOD, but had no other major glitches.  I seldom get a long spanner without at least a couple of crosses, but MANDARINORANGES jumped right out at me and gave me a huge boost.",12,positive,0.9022130370140076

"I mentioned the other day how wowed I am by constructors who are published while still at school. Mr Deshong adds to that emotion with a clean grid that updates my vocab. Like a lot of us older models I didn‚Äôt know UBERIZE or GAMIFY, but having worked them out with the crosses, their meaning is clear.

49D threw me; I automatically entered WAAFS, the UK RAF Women‚Äôs arm of the airforce during WWII. I knew SOMALIA was the country on the Horn, but stubbornly stuck with my error til the end.  Google has kindly informed me what WASPS stands for. Brave women on both sides of the Atlantic.

It wasn‚Äôt the most difficult Friday I‚Äôve done, but it made me work hard enough to feel a sense of satisfaction on finishing.",12,positive,0.8686574697494507

Great debut!",5,positive,0.9447237253189087
"Congratulations to Aidan on being published here and on starting Harvey Mudd. I agree I had not seen ""uberize"", but it was pretty guessable.
I also wanted to use this place to call attention to a great feature in today's mini: The paired entries 2D and 6A, both clued as ""cut down the middle"", both actually cut the grid down the middle. (Apologies for being slightly off-topic, but the mini doesn't have its own forum).",13,positive,0.9390262365341187
"Aidan Deshong,
Congratulations on the puzzle, and on getting into Harvey Mudd.
I was a Pomonite, but took classes at Mudd and had many Mudder friends (auto-correct had fun with Mudder). I hope you get to enjoy some of the ""traditions"" we celebrated!",5,positive,0.9491726160049438

"It's another example of the language changing. I have heard some of the answers in today's crossword, but there were a couple that I hadn't, and others used rarely in normal conversation. I may be old, but I do like to stay at least somewhat aware of what's being said and how it's being said. Though when the words appear in the crossword they may be on their way out.

I liked the variety, and that some old stuff showed up as well as new words/usage. Very nice puzzle, and not everyone gets to debut with a good Friday. Thanks, Aidan",13,neutral,0.6782710552215576

"I hardly ever do the puzzles at night, but I made an exception today and did it early. I really enjoyed the puzzle and for me it was the right balance of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm never gonna figure out this one‚Äù to ‚Äúhey, I actually did it‚Äù.  I must say that Deb‚Äôs comments  were really exceptional, especially her ponzu recipe. Also, to get a constructor about to attend Harvey Mudd just a day after having that entry in the puzzle is pretty special. Finally, I wanted to touch base early as there was a very late comment yesterday from Alena from California. She commented that yesterday was the first time she had been able to complete a rebus puzzle and she was so thrilled. EH from Austin welcomed her to the ‚Äúdark side‚Äù. I had previously commented that yesterday could have been the perfect chance for Joel to offer a Wednesday rebus to help attract newer solvers to warm up to the idea. I offer the example of the rebus puzzle of Wednesday  3/4/2009, which was remarkably similar to yesterdays‚Äô. Please take a look at the thread Alena started, including a response from Deb:
