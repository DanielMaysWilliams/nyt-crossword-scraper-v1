"@Victoria R My birthday too!  And like you, I was able to solve it without hints.  Plus I really like the rebus style crossword puzzles, so was extra happy to get one on my birthday.",15,positive,0.9827881455421448
"It’s my birthday, and I managed to solve today’s puzzle without needing the Wordplay column. I’d say that Mr. Marquez has given me a happy start to the day. Thank you!",50,positive,0.9834144711494446
"@Deb Amlen I had a similar thought to John, so if it's not outright slagging, maybe there's a slaggy quality to it? I'm just used to seeing (and, in a world where the news just seems worse every day, I look forward to) the enthusiasms for the cleverness with which the constructors construct in your little snippets. 

And, asking out of curiosity and not snark, but if you're the Editor, and you don't think it's up to snuff, you aren't obligated to publish it, yes?",31,neutral,0.5227787494659424
"I'm not weighing in one way or the other—while I found this to be a pretty easy Thursday solve, I don't have any strong feelings about it—but I think this is the first time I've seen Ms. Amlen kind of, well, slag a puzzle. Admittedly, I've only been reading Wordplay for a year and change, but I was a bit startled. Not disapproving (she is entitled to her opinion, certainly). Just wasn't expecting it.",102,negative,0.5077146887779236
