I don't know if I'd call it a wavelength thing, but a lot of my initial ""it couldn't possibly be, but I'll give it a try"" answers today turned out to be correct -- right from the jump with ENYA, and also with ELM. Luckily for me, I loved ""Like Water for Chocolate"" back in the day, so COMO was a gimme -- and meant I didn't fall for false fill at 15D. Knowing zilch about Scout gatherings, I thus assumed CAMP... something. Phew! But the end of that word held me up for quite a while!

Hey, I didn't get back to the comments very quickly Thursday night, perhaps blame the happy hour...ssss, so I also want to give a quick shout out to those of you who answered my comment Thursday night about how I can never remember AGORA -- I think your suggestions and the conversation may actually do the trick this time! I've long known what agoraphobia means but, weirdly, I had never thought about the root of the meaning. Many thanks to you all! Now I can't wait for it to show up in another puzzle! 

Also, @Barry Ancona, to answer your question, though it wasn't enjoyed that evening, the answer would always be ouzo! I have some very fond memories of ouzo evenings with friends. And probably some lost memories, I'm guessing...

"There I was, zooming right along... well on my way to a fun Saturday personal best!

Kapow!  Bam!  Screeching halt in the SE!

I've read the comments so I know my experience is not unique there. I had the IES in NO BACKSIES in and out, in and out, rinse, repeat while I tried to figure the rest out. I was proud I thought of a test score for 180 but put in PSAT first. ACK, indeed! 

I slept on the SE. It was no easier today, but I realized I had eeK at 49D instead of ACK, thus DIe instead of DIA. Fixing that helped start me on the right track for CLYDE, but it was a total guess, so I looked it up to confirm. Same with TESS.

That gave me enough structure to start plunking in letters that might make words instead of gibberish. That area took me longer than the entire rest of the puzzle, even though I also got stuck a bit on the jAMbORReS issue.

Nonetheless, I enjoyed it a lot and thought it was fun and lively. SOLVERS and I NEED A HUG are adorable! Stanley TUCCI is an absolute favorite, and I enjoyed remembering reading ""COMO agua para chocolate."" 

I never understand those who say it was unfair. I don't see it, it was just stuff I didn't know yet. It's not supposed to be easy.

I really appreciate puzzles like this one, that are a bit out of my wheelhouse and force me to work. Good to fail (or at least asterisk) once in awhile. (A fail for me would be searching the actual NYTimes clue, because that would be the same as doing a REVEAL, which would void the streak.)

"Holy cow -- I struggled and suffered everywhere!  I finished only with the help of two ""checks"", not ""cheats"", exactly -- and I'll explain the difference in a minute.

First the side of the puzzle I got completely on my own, though not without a Herculean struggle.  The combination of EDDIES at 1D and PONDERS (for ""thinks (on)"" gave me a DN to begin the ""cleaning up lots of toys""  answer and an SR to begin the ""coal miner's discovery"" answer.  Either EDDIES or PONDERS was Very Wrong and I had no idea which.  I also had EEL instead of ELM for the ""slippery"" thing.  If I had just known ENYA -- but of course I didn't.  Not until DOG GROOMER started to fill in did I change PONDERS to NOODLES.  (PONDERS is better, AGREE?)

Now for ""checking"" vs. ""cheating"" [TM]:

I didn't Google the beer directly.  I had what looked like it might be NATTY something-or-other, so I typed ""beer: NATTY"" into Google and both NATTY ICE and NATTY BOH came up.  I preferred the letters in NATTY ICE.

Why are RAIDERS ""eleven in Las Vegas""?  I thought ""eleven"" was either a very  lucky or a very UNlucky throw of the dice -- I can never remember which.

"Random thoughts:
‚Ä¢ What a gorgeous stack in the middle!  Three vivid answers, with STAIRMASTER given a world-class clue, and SCREAM QUEEN and GOES NUCLEAR not only fiery, but NYT answer debuts.
‚Ä¢ A lovely never-used before grid design that highlights the stack and is without isolated islands, which on Saturday can be pretty scary.
‚Ä¢ I found TIE for [The ‚Äú1‚Äù in 8-8-1, e.g.] inscrutable, but, after solving and seeing the explanation on the blogs, I head-slapped ‚Äì it makes perfect sense.  I love when that happens!
‚Ä¢ Plenty of rub to happify my brain, balanced by areas of ‚ÄúWhee!‚Äù. 
‚Ä¢ Answers I loved: NO BACKSIES, NOODLES for ‚Äúthinking on‚Äù, RUMI (because Rumi), TUCCI (because Tucci), WOODSY.  (Say those last three answers fast five times!)
‚Ä¢ Vibrant, fresh answer set overall that makes the whole puzzle hum.  Ten NYT debuts giving us not only never-before-seen answers (including DIRTY MIND and NO BACKSIES).  
‚Ä¢ In fact, one out of four answers in the grid have been used less than four times in the 80 years of NYT puzzles.  Wow!

I also made a few mistakes that complicated things, such as jAMbOREES instead of the never heard of CAMPBOREES, and STet for STAR, so this ended up being my longest solve in ages.  

In the end, I was looking at SHAbERS, thinking, ""Is that some ceremonial garb I never heard of?"", when a light came on, and I realized it wasn't jOMO and it wasn't SHAbERS, so what could it be?  Yes!  CAMPBOREES kind of makes sense!

"It's interesting how different people's knowledge bases are. The first commenters often say how easy a puzzle was. This one looks easy, now that I've finished it, but while I was solving? Impossible. I wasn't confident of much beyond ENYA and COMO. Stared at the NE and SE corners for a long time, partly because I thought it was YOU SEE not YA FEEL.
