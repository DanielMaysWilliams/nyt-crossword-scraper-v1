"I was amused and delighted by every single theme answer and I chuckled over all of them. Nor could I predict any of them them in advance.  You can't ask for more than that -- and certainly not on a Tuesday.

What makes them work so well is how deftly they're clued.  There's a talent to that, and Peter has it.  He must be a pretty old pro; he appears in all of my archival NYT puzzle collections from St. Martin's Press.

One of puzzledom's great kealoas?  SCAB/SCAR.  We rarely mention it, but we should.

"Ooohhh.... 

Late puzzle find, inspired by thinking about a possible alternate reveal for the theme in this one. Thought about the David Bowie Song: 'Changes' - or more specifically the chorus, which is: 

""Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes"" (and yes, I know that wouldn't have really worked for this puzzle) 

which - without the dashes - is 15 letters. And...

Yep - CHCHCHCHCHANGES was the reveal in a Thursday puzzle by David Benkof and Jeff Chen. The theme answers were:

CHANUKAHMENORAH (15 letters)
CHAOSTHEORY
CHARLOTTEBRONTE (15 letters) 
and
CHAINSMOKED

And... now I'm wondering if I might have linked to that puzzle before, as it seems somewhat familiar. Anyway here's the Xword page for it:

"I adore the crackling type of mind that comes up with a theme like this – based not only on words that end with SCH, but words that end with SCH whose first three letters are very common words that can be played with.  

This is an extraordinarily tight theme.  How many other SCH-ending words are there in the first place, that are not proper or in-the-language English?  

So, Peter amazingly found these, but then he had to come up with phrases that matched in letter count – a pair of 15s and a pair of 12s to make this theme work.  Including the gorgeous FINISHING SCHOOL to tie it all together.

It takes a talented mind and great skill to produce and execute a puzzle like this.

Okay. Sure. Much more important, I believe, is how was the solve?  To me, a stellar Tuesday, filled with brightness because of the humor in the theme itself, the trio of fun-to-look-at SCH-enders, lovely answers like GRUNTWORK, LIPLINER, and SKULLCAP, and the junk-free grid.  Even some originality in cluing, i.e., ONES has appeared in the NYT 831 times, but never clued with a Pascal’s triangle angle.

Re: Gideon.

Yet the same word is used for the room made available to Jesus for his Last Supper. In the Parable of the Good Samaritan, the Greek word pandocheion is used to describe the inn where the wounded man is taken, conforming to our modern understanding of bed & board, and stabling.

Not that the puzzle was bad - I did quite enjoy the theme, and I liked that figuring out the theme answer actually did help me solve the theme clues rather well. It was a nice enough bit of wordplay, and I'm certainly not complaining.",58,negative,0.5408815741539001
"I loved puzzling over the theme for this one. Here are three thoughts.

Thought #1 -- Maybe a FINISHING SCHOOL is what turns, say, GRUMPY OLD MEN into GRUMPY OLD MENSCH. Yeah, that's it! It is a charm school. But wait, does that work for the other themers?

Thought #2 - Well, I suppose a different kind of FINISHING SCHOOL might help you complete an Etsy-bound piece using your SEWING KIT, right? The end result is SEWING KITSCH!  Ah, but that doesn't work for the third themer. So what else?

Thought #3 - What I like about the third themer is that a STAYED PUTSCH means that those in power STAYED PUT. But that would require a FINISHING SCHOOL that quells the would-be rebellion. Would this be an elite military unit deployed by the current regime? Maybe.

In all three instances, though, the SCH gets ripped off the varsity sweater of our superhero* and stuck onto the end of themer.

"Fun Fact for First day of puzzle week:

There are no oryx in RAKU, as a recent drought of geographical awareness left a SCAR in the middle of the solving desert.

No star in the East for me kids, but a fun solve!",10,neutral,0.6217354536056519
"Sam,

GRUNT was a term some used for 11B's in Vietnam, 
but your own cite notes ""used since 1900 of various 
low-level workers.""  The term GRUNT WORK may be 
of more recent vintage, but a brawny laborer had been 
a GRUNT for quite a while.

"Sam says:

It doubles as a “hint to this puzzle’s theme” by alluding to the FINISHING “-SCH” of our themed entries, *but assumes that most of us will accept “SCH” as a common abbreviation for school and ignore the second half of the word. That may seem a bit stretchy for crossword purists*. (Emphasis added)

Yes, it is.
