"You can tune a piano, but you can't tuna fish! 

I thought it was a fun puzzle with a cute theme! I figured out the theme early on after SENSEI, since I already had the revealer. Knowing the theme actually did help me because I had no idea where Gonzaga was but knowing that it had to be a can sound led me right to Spokane. It was also helpful in confirming MILEAU and ODYSSEY. 

Went through it faster than normal for a Thursday, which is kind of funny because when I first saw the grid layout before I started puzzling, I thought it was kind of unusual so I was prepared for super tricky or difficult. I always like to spend a few seconds looking at the grid before I start. I'm not sure why, I'm not looking for anything in particular but some grids are just pretty to look at!

Nor are they sitting on top of hats in the grid.  Or under them.

I AM NOT READING THE BLOG UNTIL I FIGURE OUT THE TRICK!!!  If I have to sit here all day until the cows, UDDERs and all, come home!!!

Got it!  And it hasn't been all day.

OUGH SEI KANE IEU SSEY.  ""Oh say can you see.""  Homophones of the anthem as the theme syllables are pronounced in the words in which they appear.  

Of course, holding on to your hat during the playing of the national anthem is really a guy thing.  I often wear hats -- to protect my head from the sun in the summer and my head and ears from the cold in the winter.  I doubt I would think of removing it during the anthem, but maybe I would?  And if I didn't, would someone tap me on the shoulder to SCOLD me?

Anyway, theme aside, the puzzle was lively.  Laughed out loud at MEALY, though I think Red Delicious should sue.

"Happy Independence Day to all you US based crossworders. It’s voting day in the General Election here in the old enemy country. I for one am fervently hoping for independence from the current chaps. 
The crossword filled so quickly today I honestly thought it was Wednesday (I’ve being helping my last born move out of the nest for the last few days so am slightly weary). I had no idea what the theme could be, so felt a little relieved to read that many others couldn’t either. I feel like I’ve got a pass being non-American and not expected to know every word to your anthem, especially when teasingly mis-spelled. The pronounciation of BOROUGH has been mentioned already, but I think it’s a perfectly fine clue/answer.

OHIO has me stumped. I know two tractors makes: Deere and Massey (my DH’s transport of choice). I can see the wheels making the two Os, but the rest? You got me stumped.

What have the letters PSA got to do with FYI at 34D? I can’t work it out. I was impressed with myself that I guessed SPOKANE though.

Hi Deb! Although Brian Eno coined the phrase ""Ambient Music,"" one could argue that the real father was the French composer Erik Satie, who, in 1917, came up with the idea of what he termed ""musique d'ameublement"" (""furniture music""). Of course, the concept--music to to played while something else is happening, and not really listened to--goes a lot further back than that: Georg Philipp Telemann's 1733 collections of Tafelmusik come to mind (""Table music""--i.e. music that is to be played as background dinner music). 

***   ***

Anyway, Eno insisted that the best Ambient music should be ""interesting, yet ingnorable."" And I would be remiss not to include a youtube link of a piece every Wordplayer should acquaint themselves with: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUsDcAcANGE

"Thank you Mr. Vincent for a holiday themed puzzle.  I really enjoyed the clever clues and, like Deb wrote, I had that endorphin rush when I heard the chime.  I got hung up on a typo or would have finished sooner. I thought the wordplay was clever and playful.  I'm holding onto my hat and getting ready to sing tomorrow. May you all have a wonderful and safe day.  May the fourth be with you.  Cheers.",20,positive,0.9815764427185059

"This Independence Day finds me in a bit of a somber mood, deeply aware of what the founding fathers envisioned versus the current state of affairs.

This would probably explain why I took one look at [get in a corpse pose] and, despite knowing yoga terms, non-chalantly plucked in ""die."" At least it gave me a hearty laugh when I saw the error of my ways. I needed that.

I enjoyed the puzzle very much and figured out the theme just in time, which left me hugely satisfied.

Before I got it, I stared and stared, and decided that, 
goshdarnit, I was going to wrangle with it until I got it, even if I had to sleep on it. I'm so glad that won't be necessary.

Thank you, Mr. Vincent, for an engaging puzzle, and a Happy Fourth to all!",47,neutral,0.3871053159236908
"My first thought was, this is too hard. That was after I made my first pass and had about 5 words filled in.

My second thought was, this is interesting. That was after I filled in BOROUGH and SENSEI and began to realize where we were going with those last syllables.

My third thought was, this is fun! That was when I had enough of the revealer and the theme entries to quickly fill in the rest.

My last thought was, that was awesome! That was when I completed what first seemed impossible without a single lookup. From a dud to a bottle rocket: the most satisfying kind of puzzle. Happy 4th, everyone!",56,positive,0.5644207000732422
