"I probably wouldn't have figured out the body part part of the theme on my own, though it did help me figure out 23A on my own.

First instinct was Acute for 6D and I considered that it might not be correct as I leaned towards PATIO as a possible answer for 14A but didn't move away from it until the column gave me 20A. On 5D I initially expected MAND_ to be a single word and even when 20A gave me the last letter I had to plug it into Wikipedia to see what it was getting at. Finally, 30D seems like an awfully obscure clue for an American-centric crossword, and I wouldn't have thought of ""enthused"" as a verb rather than an adjective, so I ended up going to a thesaurus site to fill in 29A (even though I was already leaning towards OOHED for 38A, and still ended up having to stab at that being the answer and hope the gold star would appear) and stretch my streak to five days.",3,neutral,0.7198681831359863

I thought it a good design to place EYE-OPENING at 16A, where most solvers would find it as the first themer. More than any of the others, that's the one that fairly  telegraphs the trick, so leads the way on how to think about the other themers.

Then came the ""Oh, oh!"" comment. That got me back to a spot I had worried about last night.

"I’m thankful for the creators of these puzzles that help me ease into each morning, and for this community that has come together around them. Also for the opportunity nearly every day to learn something new as a result of the solve—today about ASPENS and the rhizomatic nature of their root systems. Go figure…

I had the opportunity this summer to see PATTI Smith play live. It was an outdoor show and the temperature was over 100 degrees. She would have been well within her rights (and probably better judgment) to cancel, but instead put on an unforgettable and inspiring show—she was cheering us along as much as we were cheering her.

There is inevitably a resounding chorus that ""it is.""

I will be the first to admit that I often feel a twinge of guilt whenever I can spend some time in the comment space. It is indeed a refuge from all the turmoil in the world around us -- wars, dislocation, and unrest in the Black Sea region and the Middle East; ravages wrought by climate change; threats to the foundations of our democracy, ... the list goes on and on. But I take solace in the fact that this crossword was created during the Second World War to give readers a moment of relaxation (even one as a brief as the time it takes to solve a Monday puzzle), and that as humans we need such moments in order to better deal with everything else that's going on in our lives and our world. 

So I want to thank, of course, all the constructors who make it possible for us to look forward to a new puzzle every day, as well as Will Shortz and his editorial team, along with our columnists and resident puzzle makers -- Deb, Caitlin, Sam C., Wyna, Sam E , and Joel.",31,positive,0.8783361315727234

We do a great many things with our GUT, don't we?  Before thinking of GUT-BUSTING, I thought of GUT-WRENCHING and GUT-SPLITTING.  

My only writeover was at 13A.  I always want someone to PLOW the snow for me so that I don't have to PLOD through it.

"Hi, friends! I am thankful for puzzles - and, of course, for you.

Puzzles are a sanctuary for me. They have been for over three decades, as I've been cracking and crafting conundrums since I was knee-high to a grasshopper (I have some insect jokes, but I'd hear crickets). I cherish them mightily.

And I know I am not alone. This is a world that is challenging, replete with difficult emotions. Life is hard. But, amidst perilous uncertainty, how beautiful it is that we have this little corner of cyberspace, where we can take a moment to revel in these inventive enigmas and the constructors who make them. They are no less than the finest artwork in my book, and I find some comfort in their steadfast presence, waiting to be solved.

And, of course, I love my puns. They're how eye roll. They are goofy but also, in some strange way, their wacky wordplay is almost healing. Is it hyperbolic to say they have helped me better face tomorrow? Maybe. Maybe not.

Yes, Thanksgiving has always been my favorite holiday, a time to focus on gifts all around me, many of them Cs: crosswords, coffee, cats, calculus (integral to my life), Cubbies (maybe next year). But there is also compassion, creativity, connection. Empathy and kindness do still exist, and in this shared pursuit, perhaps we do make the world a tiny bit better. For that, I am truly grateful.

To all of you, I am wishing you a wonderful (even punderful) Thanksgiving!

"I think this may be one of my favorite puzzles. Once I got one, the rest became super fun to decode! Kudos on a thouroughly enjoyable puzzle. Challenging but not too hard that it’s frustrating. Loved!",14,positive,0.985285222530365
"This was a pretty quick and easy Thursday puzzle until I got to the center. What happened?

Well, for starters, I was a little flummoxed by the use of the hyphen for a different cluing, i.e., STOPPING rather than OPENING. Maybe a period (""Valentin."") would have been clearer.

But that wasn't all. Despite having AUGUR for 29A, I kept wanting SUV for 30D. I also didn't see the disguised capital letter in the cluing for 31D. And I wanted something like OOmph for 38A, even though the cluing clearly indicates a participial adjective (can I admit that I'm somewhat tired of seeing OOH?).

In the end, maybe it amounted to an extra minute of puzzling, which I'll take as an extra minute of fun.

Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.",13,neutral,0.6181235909461975

"JAWDROPPING, EYEOPENING, HEARTSTOPPING and GUTBUSTING are much more commonly used as present participial adjectives than as gerunds. Just sayin’.",9,neutral,0.5262349843978882

"Disappointing. I was expecting a normally wacky Thursday puzzle with a Thanksgiving theme, but alas, lust a pretty lame Thursday (imo).",2,negative,0.899257242679596
"A gentle treat for a Thanksgiving solve.  
And a fine body of word work.

Thank you, Vasu.

"Re 20A, I know I've pointed this out before, but somebody has to do it:

""Who was that ladle I saw you with last night?""

""That was no ladle, just somebody I used to spoon with.""",26,neutral,0.7322812676429749
