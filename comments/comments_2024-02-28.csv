"OT (continuing discussion) Part 3a - Major Themes in The Taming of the Shrew

1.  "". . . the powers of persuasion to change not merely appearance but reality . . .""
This is taken from the Introduction to the text in The Folio Society edition of The Early Comedies, London, 1997.

It shows up immediately in the Induction where the drunkard Sly is persuaded that he is a Lord who has been suffering from amnesia.  He is incredulous at first but accepts upon meeting his  Lady-like ""wife"".  Other instances will be addressed below.

2.  Marriage and the role of women

The play-within-the-play deals with courtship and marriage.  Four suitors pursue two daughters of Baptista Minola of Padua.  Katherine, the elder, is known for her sharp tongue and shrewish behavior.  She is regarded as ""Kate the cursed.""  Bianca is known for the sweetness of her character and behavior.

Baptista has made it clear that he will not allow Bianca to marry until Kate has been wed.  Surprisingly, he has not made them aware of that!  See especially Act II,Scene1 ""She is your treasure, she must have a husband.  I must dance barefoot on her wedding day.""  See also I,1.58 

The suitors have different characteristics and reasons for wooing.  Two of them are citizens of Padua and are the only ones interested from the start.  They are Gremio, a ""pantaloon"", a term used by Shakespeare to describe the sixth of the 7 Stages of Man.   He is old and rich.  Hortensio is much younger and also prosperous.",0,neutral,0.8992728590965271

Woke up very late.  Had to get the apartment ready for my cleaning woman.  Got a new grid proposal from my puzzle collaborator on our latest collaboration.  Forgot completely that I had left today's puzzle on the dining table -- half done.

So, obviously, I wasn't completely riveted.  All those names.  Nor had I any idea at that point that there was a theme or what it was.

Finally got back to it hours later.  Whaddaya know -- the theme's terrific!  Adorable and very imaginative.  I could never have predicted it.  Or should I say IT?  Every time you think no one can ever come up with a completely new puzzle idea, someone does.

(The best news about my having forgotten about the puzzle?  My earworm's vanished, too.  I'm of the generation that sang that stupid HOKEY POKEY song -- mostly at Camp Pinecliffe, I think, but maybe at P.S.6 too.  Being me, I remembered all the stupid lyrics.

"This is a wow theme to me.  Three totally disparate ways of interpreting “What IT’S all about”.  This is a debut, but it's already clear that Greg has a crossword mind, -- Greg, whose brain, after hearing the last line of Hokey Pokey, immediately beelined to this not-so-simple-theme idea.

So, it’s a wow in that he came up with this theme to begin with.  But it’s also a wow in how the answer to the theme’s riddle became clear to me.  First, I saw the obvious connection to HOKEY POKEY, then I oho-ed at seeing the IT connection with SCARY CLOWN, and finally I caught on to the I.T. link with COMPUTER SYSTEMS.  

Thus, rather than experiencing an explosive “I get it!” all at once, this cracking of the theme unfolded – yes, that’s the word – building, crescendo-ing along to a mighty understanding that felt mighty sweet and provided a long-lasting lovely aftertaste.

That was easily the highlight of the puzzle for me, buttressed by how Greg came up with three theme answers and a revealer that satisfied the requirements of symmetry in a grid. Wow again.

For me, HOKEYPOKEY is how I made the ""sense"" of the revealer, and the other senses then dawned on me. 

Nice double tie-in with the Mini: (1) the parasite infecting both HOST and BONG, and (2) It as both SCARYCLOWN and EVIL.

"Congratulations on an amusing debut, Mr. Snitkin!

I particularly enjoyed the clue for PONTIAC. My mother owned a 1969 Firebird with a three-speed stick shift and a 350 cubic inch V-8 engine. That car was a lot of fun to drive, especially when I was 16. 

The crossing of MARADONA and ANTICS was inspired. 

Thanks!",19,positive,0.9752612113952637
"Sometimes a puzzle is just a really good time. Tonight was easy, but very amusing and an impressive bit of construction. Thanks and congrats, Greg Snitkin

Also, Mitch Hedberg is a legend. Dude has always made me laugh. That awesome delayed laugh, too. You gotta let his observations marinate and replay in your head before you realize how funny some of his stuff is. Gone too soon.

Fun puzzle that was just challenging enough that I had to take my brain off autopilot to solve.  And I even got the theme. (Not necessarily a certainty in my world. ),18,positive,0.9475821852684021
"The fill was maybe a bit too easy for a Wednesday.

But MY GOODNESS, the reveal was inspired.  I can't believe HOKEYPOKEY was your starter.  And you came up with the other two.  Great way to make an entrance.
Congrats on the debut Greg!

I was an amateur to think McFlurry might be mint.  Of course, it was OREO.  Actually, I think the current mashup flavor is OREO Mint McFlurry.  Nothing signals the coming of Spring more than a Mickey D's Shamrock Shake?  amirite!  (side note, that new Manga dipping sauce is pretty meh)

So far this week, for me, each day's solve time has been faster than the previous day.  By Sat, I may be sub 5 minutes!  haha",18,positive,0.9238978624343872

"Well, I reckon y'all got some of these clues right, but lemme tell ya, back in my day, crosswords were tougher than a two-dollar steak at a roadside diner! Sure, you got your ""Cinnamon or cardamom,"" but where's the challenge in that? Real folks used to have to wrack their brains for hours just to fill in a single square!

And don't get me started on them emoticons! What in tarnation is this world comin' to with all these winky faces and sad emojis? Back in my day, we didn't have time for such tomfoolery. Crossword puzzles were serious business, none of this smiley face nonsense!

But I'll give credit where credit's due. Some of them clues like ""Trojans' sch."" for USC and ""Elsa's sister in 'Frozen'"" for ANNA, now those are respectable. But these young whippersnappers need to toughen up these puzzles if they want to impress old-timers like me. Ain't no room for softballs in the crossword game, I tell ya!

And another thing, these newfangled abbreviations and acronyms make my head spin faster than a tornado in a trailer park! I mean, what in the name of all things holy is an ""ATM"" doing in a crossword puzzle? Back in my day, we didn't need no cash machines to solve a crossword. We relied on grit, determination, and a whole lot of elbow grease!

But you know what really gets my goat? It's these young folks with their fancy gadgets and their internet search engines, thinkin' they can solve a crossword in the blink of an eye! Why, back in my day, we had to walk ten miles through t",39,neutral,0.4684181213378906
"Hmm....

Coincidence?

MARADONA and the ""HOKEYPOKEY"" in the same grid . . .

Maradona's left arm out,
He gave the ball a little pinch
And the Brits still jeer and pout.

Easy breezy Wednesday. I didn’t know about King’s It (although it sounds familiar) but wasn’t a problem at all. Maybe a bit too easy than what I expected but not complaining!,4,positive,0.8485220670700073
"@John E @Sam L

I've posted two parts of my Taming of the Shrew comments toward the end of yesterday's column.  That should limit the number of people who are forced to scroll past them.

Much longer than expected.  It could be called ""Al's Book Report"" rather than a few selected insights and opinions.
Sorry about that.

More to follow tomorrow.

One surprise to me:  Apparently, the daughters are not aware of their father's insistence that Kate be the first to marry.",3,neutral,0.5725759267807007
"@sotto voce & @Newbie

Maybe you two will see a band in the grid to continue yesterday’s vibe? For now, PONTIAC Firebird and David bOWIE will do it for this child of the 80/90s.
