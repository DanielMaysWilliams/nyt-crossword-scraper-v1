"What a theme! I really love THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION! It is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time, and arguably one of the greatest movies of all time, so I was really tickled to discover that this was a tribute to it so early on. 

Though some of the fill (FISH FIN in particular) seemed a little so-so to me, I didn't mind because of the overall loveliness. And how often do we get both EMU and EEL in one puzzle!? üòâ

Loved that INDY would be followed by 500 and that ANDY crawled 500 yards (That's the length of 5 football fields, just shy of half a mile) to his freedom! 

Being a super fan of the movie, there are things I wish they could have added, like Morgan Freeman, Zihuatanejo, and a quote about hope, but I can't even imagine what it took to create this masterpiece... (Was it as painstakingly meticulous and hopeful as Andy's 20-year tunnel dig?)  And I can only imagine that, the constructors being big fans as well, they would have loved to have fit more in. Their love of the movie certainly shone through! My thanks to both!!

I saw the movie when it came out and confidently entered the title in the two downs. I can remember Robbins and Freeman but not the character‚Äôs name.

"Amazing puzzle but not easy for me. This was an extreme reminder of what a terrible memory I have. That's a favorite film and... I couldn't remember much of anything about it. Actually had to cheat a bit to get through, but still some great 'aha' moments when I finally caught on to things. 

And, of course a puzzle find today, inspired by AGAPES at 97a: That led me to think about 'mouth agape and arms akimbo' and led to a Tuesday from September 19, 1989 by Sidney L. Robbins. Just thought it was a cute piece of construction. Four theme answers:

"My first guess for 44D (clued as ""Fall accessory?"") was APPLETREE. The correct answer turned out to be PARACHUTE, but was I maybe anticipating the adjacent (42A) BADAPPLE?

 I thought ESCAPEACT was an apt revealer. When I first look over an intricately constructed grid like this one, I often feel like Houdini chained up in a vault at the bottom of the East River. Though there's not the same urgency for me to find my way out and up, finally coming to the surface still feels great.",6,neutral,0.6344040036201477
"It‚Äôs less a criticism of the puzzle than just a statement that the theme didn‚Äôt appeal to me. (That‚Äôs fine; I don‚Äôt expect ever theme to resonate with me.) I‚Äôve had 30 years to see ‚ÄúThe Shawshank Redemption‚Äù (and when it came out, we went to the movies often). The fact that I haven‚Äôt seen it is indicative of my lack of interest in it, though I know many people consider it their favorite movie.

Between a few letters and the length of the answers, I knew the title as soon as I saw the clue. TIM ROBBINS was a gimme, but I needed a lot of crosses to get the character‚Äôs name.

My real issue was that the 23-wide grid made for smaller than usual squares (I solve in the NYT Games app on my iPad). Throw in shaded squares and circles (hey, Nancy) and my eyes were tired by the end. 

But the fill was generally easy, which means I made a lot of typos. Having to spend five extra minutes to track them all down was not fun.

If I had enjoyed the theme more, I‚Äôd be more inclined to overlook iffy answers like FISH FIN, UPN, M AND M‚ÄôS (no, just no, not ever), HIT A RUT and especially OK TO.

I could also have come unstuck if I'd followed my first instinct and put TAROCK in 63d.

So eventually I got the right movie and eventually I got ANDY DUFRESNE (think I remember him?  You've got to be kidding!) even though I saw the movie.

I don't remember the ESCAPE either, but I'm sure there must have been a TUNNEL, PASSAGE, TRENCH, DUCT, SHAFT, whatever.  They were easy to spot here, being in gray and all, but as for the tiny little circles and what I did/thought about them -- well YOU know!!!!

Maybe they spell out the guy's name or something?  But then why is the ""Y"" all by its lonesome in the middle of what looks like the escapee's leg?  Beats me.  This is the sort of thing that I usually go to Rex to find out, but Rex has written the equivalent of ""War and Peace"" today and it will take me the whole morning to track it down that ""Y"" and it's another gorgeous day.

Although I can imagine the manager of a New-age boutique telling their employee: ""put the crystals there, and the TAROTS over there.""

Anyone pretentious enough to talk about more than one agape would most likely spell it ""agap√¶""--complete with ligature--or even ""agapai."" The OED lists the plural AGAPES as ""rare."" Like, how common is the word ""agape"" in the first place?

(The OED's first citation of ""agapes"" is from *The Corruptions of Christianity* (1782) by the polymath theologian/chemist Joseph Priestley. He probably used it just to irritate the establishment CoE sorts. A shout out the fascinating biography of him, *The Invention of Air*)

Similarly TEMPOS. I'd like to think that all *real* musicians would only use ""tempi,"" but, sadly, they don't. With a subtle air of British snobbery, the Oxford (English) Dictionary lists the first citation of ""tempos"" as an entry in the (American) Webster's New International Dictionary (1934), but by 1980, they  had to concede its use in the music reviews of the Times (of London).

"ESCAPEArT looked fine, as did MArON. I suppose ESCAPEACT was a slightly better fit for the clue, but I was fixated on the term ""escape artist"". I also know very little about Georgia, and I thought that maybe the actor's Marc Maron's name derived from a city there. Anyway, I had to enable autocheck to catch that mistake. It was my personal natick.

I might have seen the featured movie a long, long time ago, but remembered very little of it.  My only cheat was when the puzzle was nearly complete.

I'm glad that so many more familiar with the movie got so much enjoyment from the puzzle's construction. 
Aside from the movie associations, I thought there were a lot fun clues.
Finally, I am eternally grateful that the constructors did not go with a Mario Brothers theme.",7,positive,0.6316096186637878
"Really easy and uninspired.  I got no joy or real cleverness from the theme, although I do always appreciate a Shawshank reference.  Pity it wasn't better.  Maybe I missed something.  When I get a chance I'll read through the comments.

I only read Wordplay to find out what the static Y was for, to no avail.  Ah well.  They can't all be a puzzle of the decade.  ;)

"This puzzle was made by two pros, Jeremy with 28 NYT puzzles and Tracy with 37.  They put their skills on display in this grid, no?

That freedom route in the lower grid is masterful, remarkable grid building.  Look, please LOOK at its elements:

It starts in a small rectangular cell which gets broken out of, then moves through a matrix of constricted spaces, and ends up right at the edge of the grid, ready to burst out into freedom.  Not only did they find nine synonyms for narrow spaces, but they interlinked them, made every one of them a part of a word or phrase, AND found a way to have the letters of Andy‚Äôs full name appear IN ORDER through the escape.  And with all this going on, they filled in the whole area cleanly!!!

Hello?  Hello?  Is this not a feat of feats?

Plus, it‚Äôs cool, giving the solving experience a visual layer.  

Having the theme be one of my favorite movies ever, well, that‚Äôs piling on, piling on with goodness and having me leave the puzzle feeling warm all over, excited about what can be done in a box of squares, and, corny as this sounds, happy to be alive.

Thank you, Tracy and Jeremy, for a puzzle that‚Äôs going to stick with me for a long time.  Brava and bravo!",84,positive,0.8415552973747253

The theme is very fun, I've always liked themes where there are words hidden inside other words, and I like the unique grid and style. 18x23 is something I'm relatively sure has never been done in an NYT crossword before and I think it was executed well.

"Luckily, the movie wasn't crucial for the solve, because I never saw it, so I put my head on autopilot and the fills dropped in one after another.  TRENCHCOAT?   I love them, and so went with it. Ratso's line? I did see that one, so did the same.  DUCTTAPE? We do that a lot around here.  ANDY's last name looked pretty iffy, but wrote it in anyway.  The puzzle got done in record time‚Äîdelirious fun, like skating on thick ice for a change, but....oh Noooo!  Not another fly speck search!  Mr. Houdini's specialty had looked off to me, but I'd entered it anyway, and of course it took about maybe an hour or two to get the DOH! moment and achieve REDEMPTION.
