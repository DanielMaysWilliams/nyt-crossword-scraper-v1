"Good puzzle!  Thanks to Natan!

I had a few look ups (which I allow myself Thursday - Sunday), so I learned something.  Some of my first guesses turned out to be right - which does *not* always happen.

Loved the clues for 17A SUBWAY ADS; 22A Midday assignation NOONER; and 42A LASAGNA.

31A [Rotary Successor] = TOUCHTONE was great and brought back a fun memory!  I was in 7th or 8th grade in 1972/73 timeframe (don't do the math!) and went on a school trip to the Boston Museum of Science.  One of the displays was the telephone dialing systems.  You dialed your phone number using the rotary dial (like we all had at home) and then you ""tapped"" your phone number using the telephone ""pad"" with square buttons that had numbers on them.  Then they told you the time it took to do each one and the pad was sooooo much faster!

As a teen, I had a job in a convenience store and became *very* fast on the lottery machine when people were playing the daily numbers game.  Then, I somehow became an accountant (it was an accident - my accounting 101 teacher was very handsome!).

The problem with a calculator is that the numbers on the buttons are the reverse of the numbers on a phone and the lottery machine has the buttons in a phone configuration with the 123 across the top.  So, many years of using the lottery machine has caused me to be error prone on the calculator - still after all these years!  I regularly hit a 9 instead of a 3 or vice versa.

Do emus have lucky numbers?",6,positive,0.9433049559593201

"Being a midwesterner, I am vastly more familiar with Subway sandwiches than subways as transportation, so even after I got 17 across, it took me a moment to say aha! I was scratching my head as to why a Subway (sandwich store) ad would be low and inside.

This is not an endorsement of Subway sandwiches, by the way. I like that they offer a lot of veggies but otherwise there are better go tos around here these days. 

I sailed through a lot of this one, surprisingly, but the NW really was tough for me. I ended up doing one lookup (LYME), which caused me to do a check puzzle, because I don't want gold stars if I do a lookup. That's just me, I don't expect anyone else to feel the same.

Anyhow, the check puzzle revealed  hoWL was wrong, which I felt pretty confident about, and some errors in the NE, that surprised me. I had NetS instead of NABS, which resulted in misspelling LARIATS. And not remembering the lover, though knowing I had seen it here recently, and not knowing the beer, those were wrong. Sad sigh! 

I need to remember that Don is mob related. I'm not mob movie person and I just don't think of it. I kept trying to make don be puts on or clothes or the like.I put this out here, so hopefully I will remember it, and THISBE.

Anyhow, it was a nice puzzle on a lazy Saturday morning with a lot of enjoyable cluing. My many gaps in knowledge are certainly not its fault and didn't detract from it being a fun puzzle.",4,neutral,0.5117165446281433
"Slightly off-tooic, but as a pilot and weather geek, I need to point out that the clue for 12A in the Mini [Precipitates freezing rain] is incorrect for the answer SLEET.  Freezing rain is supercooled (liquid state below 0¬∞C) water that freezes instantly on contact with objects such as airplane wings, power lines, tree limbs, roads, and the ground.  It‚Äôs what causes ice storms and their damage.  Sleet is water drops that freeze high in the atmosphere forming small pellets.  

The distinction is important.  Sleet is relatively harmless but freezing rain causes widespread damage and can be lethal to airplanes without sufficient ice protection.  So-called ‚Äúclear ice‚Äù can form extremely quickly and will cause the wing to lose significant lift, possibly resulting in an aerodynamic stall and loss of control.  Pilots‚Äô two biggest fears are thunderstorms and clear ice.",13,neutral,0.4916810095310211

Second -- I don't think I've ever seen a puzzle with so many interlocking traps for the solver to fall into.  Could it be accidental -- or was it fiendishly plotted in advance by Nathan Last?

HOWL instead of BAWL for ""wail"" led me to HOWARD instead of BAYARD someone-or-other (though I couldn't remember any HOWARDs from that 1963 March)... led me to ISLE instead of CORE for ""key"" ...led me to ICE CREAMS instead of CREW TEAMS for the ""shell"" clue.

Back on a one day streak. 

Interesting puzzle find today. A Monday from August 3, 1998 by Nancy Salomon. Four theme answers in that one, all with exactly the same clue: ""No way!"" The answers:

"Ahhh, the rewards of a Natan Last puzzle.  He always offers something for everyone and a thread to pull it all together.  Just when you think you're stuck, there's an in.  Really nice clues for LIP READER, SUBWAY ADS and TOUCH TONE, among others.  

[Whirl, so to speak] reminded me of a visit to a pizza shop in FL decades ago (I know, but we were desperate).  They gave complementary garlic bread, which tasted really weird.  I asked whether they used butter or olive oil, and the couter person proudly said, ""It's Whirl!"" and showed us a disgusting pot of goo.  We wanted to hurl.",7,positive,0.8669055700302124
What a great set of clues!,6,positive,0.9741369485855103
"Fastest Saturday ever! Really on the same wavelength as this one. SOSA, RUSTIN, Said, even Narnia were all gimmies. Loved it!",8,positive,0.9882305860519409
"Still on a high after my success with Friday's puzzle, I had a great start to this one.  I managed to get through the top half in record time and thought I might have a rare Saturday with no lookups.

Alas, the bottom half did me in. I struggled with the tricky clues and forgot Mayim's last name. Eventually I muddled through with a few googles. 

I'm disappointed, but only with myself and not the puzzle. It was full of clever and fun clues. I found 50A especially tricky.",6,positive,0.9104925394058228
"What is the context of 34D, ‚ÄúI MISSED‚Äù?  I am a big sports guy but I feel like this is a stretch, unless I‚Äôm thinking about it wrong.  Can someone explain?",2,negative,0.6271854639053345
"Don't think I've seen this yet, but 33D [epitome of completeness] completely ambushed me.  

Even after getting with crosses, I stared at it until my eyes crossed before I finally saw it.",6,negative,0.5611908435821533
Loved the photo. Looks like a fledgling troupe of the Trocs doing ‚ÄòDuck Lake‚Äô in summer repertory. The emu wants to know where it can sign up.,5,positive,0.9509196281433105
Diabolically brilliant puzzle.  I was pleased with myself when I filled the SW to NE diagonal but had to take a break before I saw my mistaken fills in the NW corner.  This old lady was flummoxed by the SE and had to resort to Sam‚Äôs help to ‚Äúcross the t‚Äôs‚Äù so to speak.,8,positive,0.7508352994918823
"I love the NYT crosswords to the point of doing part of the archive twice.  
This one made me feel my age, not with it and tired, so I looked up midday assignation, one two others, decided I‚Äôve aged out and stopped.  Not for the great-grandma set, we who‚Äôve survived to tell the    tale.  
I‚Äôll excise the grinch tomorrow.  Perhaps a reaction to the Covid jab in one arm and the flu in the other, yesterday.
Sigh.  Night all.",12,positive,0.6347827315330505

"Similar to last Saturday, which was also a fact-heavy puzzle, with very few anything at all phrases, so not very typical Saturday. 
This week I was helped greatly because I had just watched an interview with the actor Colman Domingo, who played BAYARD RUSTIN in the movie about him which came out last year. 
 I enjoyed solving it.
Thanks, Natan",6,neutral,0.5708635449409485

"Sadly this was a puzzle of the kind I personally like least - made difficult by saturating it with trivia. The uncommon words I did not know I have no complaints about - after all, Saturdays are supposed to test us solvers, our vocabularies, too. From time to time some of us, especially from abroad, will fail, and that's fine. But the trivia... When the puzzle is as hard as this, and there are a dozen or two of proper names, organization abbreviations etc. I just can't find any enjoyment in dealing with it. Sure, I really liked some of the clues, like the one for STUNTS, but overall this was not a nice experience for me.

My physio is a professional rower but I had no idea her boat could be called a SHELL. Apparently this particular word does not even have a Polish counterpart - we just call it ""≈Ç√≥dz"", boat.

I think I once saw the word SKOSH in these puzzles but only remembered it with almost all of the crosses.

I would appreciate it if the community explained some things to me.

Why was NBA clued as an org. that discourages travelling? Apparently I don't understand what travelling means in this context.

Gertrude, DANE? Google tells me it may be a pre-made, unplayable The Sims character, but that can't be it, surely?

Concessions: SOPS?

Cheek: TUDE? Is this short for attitude?",14,negative,0.7667620182037354
Brilliant! An almost perfect puzzle. With one exception (etsy) it was wholly original. Well done.,7,positive,0.9819183349609375
"Hey Sam, I like that you ""get a little thrill from seeing modern slang used in the Times Crossword,"" but the word LIT is only modern in the sense of ""everything old is new again."" I remember drunks being described as LIT as far back as the 1950s.",10,positive,0.5763220191001892
Thanks to Sam for the explanation on 17A. This guy from Los Angeles really didn't understand how an ad for a sandwich shop was low and inside.,4,neutral,0.4864291548728943

My grandson is named after 5 down. How great to see him in a NYT puzzle.,21,positive,0.9766197800636292
"Lots of very clever clues throughout,

made up for the fiendish SW corner,

where I found the crossing of a pre-Jennings Jeopardy host,

and a Pinocchio character, with a national motto (of any country),

to be rather Naticky",23,positive,0.6275181174278259
"Moderately scary but ultimately doable.  A nice little workout.  A few things I didn't know.

Favorite clue was probably ""rotary successor"" only because I spent so much time pondering it - rotary club?  Wankel rotary engine? - before the ""duh"" moment as it got filled in.  Somewhat similar experience for other clues too.

Mountbattens crossed with Argentinian folk music seems kind of mean though...

"I found this easier than Friday‚Äôs, possibly because this time, DREAM DATE was 100% correct instead of a bit better than half right. Things that I didn‚Äôt know, like the ‚ÄúNarnia‚Äù title and MARSEILLE, were easy to get with a few crosses. 

It‚Äôs interesting to see that the debut entries include such familiar phrases as GOOD KARMA and TOUCH-TONE. Those, plus clever clues like the one for SUBWAY ADS, show that puzzles don‚Äôt have to be the SAME OLD STORY. 

Thanks, Mr. Last!",28,positive,0.8785243034362793
My fastest Saturday crossword with minimal look-ups. That was LIT!,8,positive,0.9779798984527588
"Completed below my average but did not enjoy it - 20+ trivia / proper noun references, slangs like LIT,  TUDE and PEC without any indication, oddball clues like for SUBWAY ADS (‚ÄúEats Shoots and Leaves‚Äù anyone?) and TRY ‚Äî felt like the constructor was trying too hard to twist things up. Oh well, there is always tomorrow‚Ä¶",6,negative,0.8834143280982971
"So intricate and funny, fills that seemed to wobble all over the place before they solidly LIT in place.  I confess to one look-up (my knowledge of W.H. Auden is limited, mostly to his poem on the death of W.B Yeats, which includes the beautiful line, ""Earth, receive an honored guest . . . "") but everything else revealed itself with the crosses.  

I was tearing my hair out because I wanted STand-in and it didn't fit.  I wanted something like SUBWoofer (I don't even know how that would have applied, but I liked it)‚Äîbut, the crosses scotched that one, too.  Needless to say, I had a very good time, and if it were up to me, there would be ice crEAMS al around.  

Thank you, Natan Last. for a first class crossword!",17,positive,0.5345972180366516
"Each August and for a few months, I travel to Italy, and stay at a villa just east of Vatican City. I‚Äôm catholic (lowercase c), or I pray so.

It‚Äôs the weather, the sojourn of leaves, the brisk, decaying wind among the decaying buildings. It‚Äôs quieter, even the Italian. And, yet, for years I‚Äôve remarked I am the only person among itinerants but, especially, the natives, with, I daresay, a bounce in my step, a mirthful countenance, yes, a cheery disposition ‚Äî a sort of joie de vivre ‚Äî walking the cobblestones of lawless traffic along Vespa caravans.

I‚Äôve asked many a passerby in barely-passable Italian, ‚ÄúWhy the melancholy? This is the birthplace of passion.‚Äù But all I get is that Euro-dismissal, bundling off.

I don‚Äôt get it.

So, friends, come, I say. Come and join me in the 11th hour of the year, with Western Indifference, and celebrate the Fall of Rome.

"Regarding Sam Corbin‚Äôs help with 30 across in the October 5 puzzle, I note that she said one would need to be familiar with certain boating terms. The answer uses the term crew team, which, unfortunately, is a redundant and wrong term for the rowers in a shell. The rowers are simply the crew, just as all the people who operate a ship or boat are referred to as the crew.  The sport is called ‚Äúcrew‚Äù, which confuses the situation and probably leads to people calling members participating a team (as it pretty much every other sport), but properly speaking the rowers are simply  ‚Äúthe crew‚Äù",8,neutral,0.7526440620422363
"Hi Natan, 
Compared to your ""challenging"" New Yorker puzzles, this puzzle is at the kindergarten level. When I saw you name, I expected something MUCH more challenging. It's a bit too easy for a NY Times Saturday, I solved it with no lookups.",2,neutral,0.42326226830482483
I had to cheat a lot to finish this one. It contained some arcane trivia. Nonetheless it was an interesting puzzle with fun clues for the most part.,24,positive,0.888476550579071
"Fun puzzle.  I really made a hash of the NW.  I had Tyne before LYME and tvs before LGS and BAYARDRUSTIN and EDWINA were unknown to me.  I sorted it out eventually.

Speaking of hash, I must have had food on my mind while solving because I wanted to fill shells with ricotta, and was disappointed that CREWTEAM was the correct response.  Happily the puzzle satisfied my pasta craving a little farther down with hearty helping of LASAGNA.

I was happy to see Buddy Guy make his way into the clues.  He‚Äôs one of my favorite blues guitarists whose solos always ring out. He‚Äôs a fine singer too.

This was a nice, challenging puzzle, although I suspect it may have more general knowledge questions than some will find tolerable.",19,positive,0.8526153564453125
