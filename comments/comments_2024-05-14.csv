"Fun puzzle. I, like many others have already mentioned, developed a taste for Kurt Vonnegut Jr. at a young age and have enjoyed him ever since. He has a great presentation about the shapes of stories as represented on a graph where the vertical axis is Good Will/Ill Will, and horizontal is time, or the Beginning/End. I was lucky enough to see him do it live in the early 80s, and there are a few videos out there of him doing it at various ages. 

He actually proposed it for his masters thesis [anthropology] at U of Chicago, and it was unanimously rejected. He left without a degree. 25 years later the university accepted Cats Cradle in lieu of a thesis, and awarded him his masters degree. 

""As Vonnegut said shortly after, 'This was not an honorary degree but an earned one, given on the basis of what the faculty committee called the anthropological value of my novels.' Vindication, at long last.""

"Four long-ish theme answers plus a long-ish revealer makes for a very dense theme.  To put them in the Downs and not the Acrosses -- does that make it harder to construct?  I really have no idea.  But Alex has been constructing puzzles for a long time and this seems like the work of a seasoned pro to me.

I liked the fact that all the tree parts are not tree parts as used in the theme answers.  I also liked the fact that Alex almost avoided using any names at all in the grid. I was still thinking ""By George, he's going to do it!"" 2/3 of the way to the bottom.  And then ERNEST, GIBB and CHU appeared.  Oh, well.  Next time.  Good try, Alex.

I think there should be a small statuette awarded to anyone who can construct a grid with no proper names at all.  A little smaller, perhaps, than the Oscar and the Tony, but precious in its own way. Let's call it ""The Nameless"".",10,neutral,0.6269710063934326
"I liked all the busy bees over on the right side today! 

BEE
BESIDE
B SCHOOL

B ALL PIT (I like the idea of this pit we can jump in and realize our full potential.)

Also, I have no idea how I immediately knew that the cat breed with blue eyes is SIAMESE. I put it in right away without crossings and I'm not sure how I knew it but I guess somewhere in my misspent youth, I must have encountered this information. 

A quick solve in which my only problem was not knowing the Swiss bank or the director of Crazy Rich Asians, I had most, including CH, from the crossings and went with CHO. When I didn't get the happy music, I figured it was probably that since it was just a guess and tried U -- to much happiness! 

I have to admit that I forgot there was a theme until I finished and read the column. Guess it didn't register much with me this time and it wasn't at all needed to solve the rest.

I liked the clue for HAY a lot! That made me smile! It reminded me of a week I spent, a very intense week, helping to bale and store hay for a church camp I volunteered at in my aforementioned misspent youth. Ooh, that was hard work!! After that I always stuck to working in the kitchen! Also very hard work, but much more in my wheelhouse!! 

Still, I am glad how I spent that week and I feel it's given me an appreciation for the kind of work that isn't in my wheelhouse! I remember that week with pride that I could do it, even if I never wanted to again. ü§†",10,positive,0.9446881413459778

Today's Strands was very unusual for me: I found what must have been *dozens* of non-theme words, one after another without a single theme word popping up!

As for putting a BARK COLLAR on your CANINE, just realize that you are not addressing the anxiety causing the barking, only your poor pup's means of expressing it.  It's similar to putting tape on the mouth of a post-op patient instead of alleviating their pain.

AROMAS followed by ODORS raised a smile. Being a die hard Zepp fan 36A was a gimme, leading to a fab earworm for the day. Might have to crank up the turntable and stick the (original) vinyl on.

A minor nit: 24D is a perfectly good clue/answer, but those devices are little better than torture implements. So much so that they are banned in the UK. What dog owner thinks it‚Äôs reasonable to cut off their pet‚Äôs voice? It‚Äôs your dog‚Äôs main method of communication.

One of the language-centered podcasts I listen to just dropped an episode I think a lot of people here will like. Helen Zaltzman's The Allusionist's most recent episode is titled ""Word Play Part 4: Good Grids."" It's about crossword construction, with a focus on newer constructors bringing newer and more diverse points of view to puzzles. (If you think crosswords are not allowed to change with the times, or if you're easily triggered by inclusion and diversity, you might want to skip it.) 

The guests include constructors Erik Agard, Juliana Pache, Rachel Fabi, and Adrian Johnson.

I don't agree with everything I heard, but it was time well spent (<40 minutes if you skip the ads).
