"Hi Sam! Are you swole, jacked, or YOKED? This article might help:
https://www.muscleandstrength.com/articles/swole-jacked-yoked-lingo
And there are at least 97 more ways to say it (some of whicjh the emus moght not approve of), as Dom Mazzetti is happy to explain: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XrgkvzAorM

But in researching this, I discovered that ""yoked"" is a slang term in Northern Ireland for ""high on Ecstasy,"" as in ""I was so yoked at the Snow Patrol concert in Derry last night.""

Which meaning did that drugged-out gym-rat Georg Frideric have in mind? We may never know . . .https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNqamx8uUdA",7,neutral,0.7262275815010071
"I always bump on SKITS being used to describe what SNL does. I recall from my improv troupe days that the preferred term is ""sketches"", although making that distinction may be limited to the pedants of the comedy scene (many of whom are never seen in comedy scenes).

I've been playing for less than a year, so the thrill of completing a Thursday puzzle without consulting anything but my own brain is quite the rush!",25,neutral,0.6661651134490967
"This is for Sam C.  Maybe you'll be reading the comments today, or someone will alert you to this.

Yesterday, your column was headed OBSTACLE TO CHANGE.  Below it was a photo of five wind turbines, captioned, ""Can you guess how these wind turbines relate to the article's headline?""

A number of people, in the comments, tried.  IMO, nothing sounded right.  I was thinking that toward the end of the day, you'd chime in with the answer to the riddle, but alas no.

But the riddle is still nagging at me, and maybe others as well.  Would you be kind enough to post your riddle's answer????

Thank you in advance.",18,neutral,0.8654782176017761
