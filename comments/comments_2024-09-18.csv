"Haven‚Äôt read all the comments, but I was comforted to see that others, including Sam, found it more challenging than the usual Wednesday. It certainly was a challenge but also fun and enlightening when I finally got there. I‚Äôm old, so I‚Äôve watched the old (and delightful) film, ‚ÄúDesk Set‚Äù (starring the great duo Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy) many times. The other big star of that film is a very large early computer which they called EMERAC, (or ‚ÄúEmmy‚Äù). When I saw the clue, I thought of Emmy right away, but I also knew the name ENIAC from something‚Äîmaybe another film?‚Äîand that was what I put in that space. I had a lot more luck with the bottom half of the puzzle than I did with the top. As Sam points out, the crossing fill was crucial for this one. I never would have gotten the church without crosses. Congrats on a terrific debut, Casey. And also thank you Will, for helping make this challenging and entertaining puzzle happen.",13,positive,0.9316543936729431

A couple of examples (using underscores to represent squares with other letters that were different answers but not part of the theme answers): 

Clue: Pineapple desserts.

 ______S

So.. the implied answers was UPSIDE (down) CAKES

Today Will did something quite different with a different collaborator.  Tiny little circles do not a ""Nancy puzzle"" make.

‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm guessing many did not know the name of the church that spans row three, (certainly not me!), yet it was gettable due to artful cluing of its crosses, that is, making them easy enough to get while maintaining Wednesday resistance. 

Bravo constructors and editors on that!  

LACUNA reminded me of Barbara Kingsolver‚Äôs novel ‚ÄúThe Lacuna‚Äù, which I adore and highly recommend.

Normally, tribute puzzles just give facts/features of what or who is being honored.  But today we also have a graphic representation (the steps) that includes wordplay (having Spanish going down the steps).

DISTROS? Got it from the crosses, but don't think it should have been in a Wednesday puzzle. I do believe it's too obscure for most solvers.

I've been to the Spanish Steps twice, first as a young single with Europe on $5 a day clutched in my hands, as the young Italian men did what all the guidebooks said they'd do. Use your imagination. I used to be fluent in Italian, so I always think of the Italian expression that describes it. 

Second visit decades later, this time with a guide who foiled a pickpocket attempt.

"CROCUS crossed with DISTROS was definitely approaching Natick territory for me, but besides that cross, I thought the puzzle flowed nicely, with a good mix of interesting clues, answers, and not too much bad fill at all. Nice job :)",8,positive,0.9342884421348572
"LACUNA crossing ENIAC felt like a Friday or Saturday to me, but maybe that's just me and my lack of familiarity with these words. I ended up looking up the [Pioneering 1940s computer] since I didn't feel like running through the alphabet on this one.",34,neutral,0.6729959845542908
"No clue on distros, had to fill in with crosses. Thanks to New York Author Diane Duane (Young Wizards) I knew the term lacuna. Thanks to Tamora Pierce (Circle of Magic) I knew that saffron comes from crocuses.",11,neutral,0.7925917506217957
The 3D/22A intersection really had me for a good 5 minutes looking for whatever error was in the puzzle. 95% of this was a breeze with just a few (17A?) that are entirely unknown to me.,5,positive,0.43982118368148804
"Hmm, tough week!  Solved this one quickly enough but it was pretty hard, for me at least.  The circle gimmick, such as it was, didn't reveal itself until I was done, and frankly while I'd barely heard of the steps, the cathedral up top was and will remain a mystery name to me.  Almost seemed unfair to be honest considering it's a full width ""spanner"".

Oh well, this to me seemed like a self indulgence on the part of the constructors.  Moving on.  :)

"Ole.  I found this one straightforward, except that DISTROS was unfamiliar to me.  I didn‚Äôt catch on to the significance of the circles until the puzzle was complete - a clever feat of construction.  The puzzle conjured up my various trips to Rome, and memories of eating gelato while sitting on THESPANISHSTEPS.  A very nice way to end the day.",12,positive,0.9443635940551758
"‚ÄúLinux software packages‚Äù had me thinking more along the lines of .deb, RPM, but those didn‚Äôt fit‚Ä¶ but ‚Äútarball‚Äù did! Alas, it was ‚Äúdistros‚Äù instead, which is not what I expected given the clue. Surely I‚Äôm not the only geek here thrown for a loop by that!",11,negative,0.6023136973381042
"Thanks Casey & Will, that was fun. Being Canadian, I don't speak Spanish, but as Sam said it was solvable through the crosses.

Sam be sure to get to P.E.I and get a lobster roll from Original Richard's. You'll never be the same.",9,positive,0.9021376371383667
