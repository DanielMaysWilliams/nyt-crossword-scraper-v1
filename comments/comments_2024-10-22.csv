"I feel like when an answer is explicitly gendered, the NYTimes often does a fairly good job of adding a qualifier to the clue acknowledging that the answer isn't the exclusive solution. Often that takes the form of including a word like ""some"" or ""for one"" or ""perhaps"" something along those lines.  That they chose not to qualify the ""Guitarist"" / AXMAN pair at all was mildly disappointing, but I'm not crying foul too loudly.

The Steart marshes are now an amazing wetland full of bird and insect life.

"(I find myself again being OT for the current puzzle, just trying to post about puzzle from over the weekend. Emufied as usual.)

The [Half of LV] clue, that ended up being the Las half of Las Vegas, got many people thinking about how to represent [Half of 55] in Roman numerals. Of course the Romans could represent incredibly fine fractions, but with an interesting twist:
while the numbers for integers are in a tens-based system (IVXLCDM), fractions were based on a twelve-part division.

S was the letter used for semi(s), 1/2, but it actually meant 6/12. So half of LV would be XXVIIS.

The sign ‚Ä¢ was used for the twelfth part of a unit, called uncia. Uncia has come down to our language in two paths: an ‚Äúounce‚Äù is the twelfth part of a pound (originally), and an ‚Äúinch‚Äù is the twelfth part of a foot.

It also survives in the name of the pattern ‚Åô, ‚Äúquincunx‚Äù, which represented 5/12. The pattern is used in laying out orchards, and on dice and cards, and lots of other ways today. Quinque + uncia became the portmanteau quincunx.

For practical reasons, they later added a sign for 1/24, Œ£, meaning half of a twelfth, which allowed for the sign Œ£‚Ä¢, meaning three-halves of a twelfth, to give the fraction 1/8.
