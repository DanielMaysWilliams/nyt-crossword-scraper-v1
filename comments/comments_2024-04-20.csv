"A quick* ramble [*Narrator: not-so-quick] :

I kinda liked this puzzle.

I'd never heard of 30D NAZCALINES, and some other answers were tough for me, but other things fell into place and some of the clues were brilliant, ELOPE, GERALD etc.

Just a couple of free-associative things before I head toward dinner:

As a kid I got Seiji Ozawa's autograph (possibly twice, or maybe it was Vladimir Ashkenazy's autograph I got after two different concerts? Don't recall) backstage at Ford Auditorium in hometown Detroit. I was in the habit of trying to get autographs of pianists and conductors at concerts when growing up, and my parents indulged me. My older sister had a crush on Seiji Ozawa and I guess by association I kinda got a crush too. For her I think it was partly his Beatles haircut at the time. But he was a brilliant conductor, brilliant.

I also got signed programs from pianist André Watts, maybe a few others… Later, in college, I got Gene Roddenberry's autograph on a paper plate at a publicity event, he wrote ""Long Live and Prosper"" (almost right). Later as an adult I got 🎸Robyn Hitchcock's autograph on a clothes-hanger (I thought it a suitably quirky thing to sign). At a later Ann Arbor show I think I got his whole band's autographs, after four-handed jamming with bassist Andy Metcalfe at the Blind Pig's bar-area piano. *Ana Gasteyer voice* Good times...

I don't know all the Shakespeare plays by any means, zilch about the historical plays & lots of gaps, but Twelfth Night>",0,positive,0.6928552985191345

"This puzzle gave me the WARM FUZZIES from start to finish! There were so many lovely clue and entries, I'd be hard-pressed to say what I looked most, if it weren't for a reference to my favorite poem--""Hope is the Thing with Feathers."" It helped me in the puzzle because I immediately removed SHave because I know the poem by heart. That poem has carried me through a lot of difficult days. Hope has indeed caused me great despair at times but it's also always the thing that saved me from the despair. Yet, never, in extremity, it asked to crumb of me.

Anyhow, enough of that, I so loved today's puzzle, though there were a lot of difficult spots for me, I was able to work all of them out without lookups, for which I am very happy to say!! Loved BOOM ROASTED!  And GERALD! 

I really struggled with the last two days, though, I never finished them in time to  make comments but I didn't really enjoy them. Most likely because of extreme back pain I'm experiencing and occasionally tried to do a puzzle while under muscle relaxers... 🫣 So I have no complaints! I've often found in life that if I'm grumpy about something, it's usually because of something with me, not the other person or thing. One thing about Friday that really stumped me was FLAK. It was the first thing I thought of even the first time around but I left it because I had no idea it wasn't spelled with a c.  I looked it up later and it looks like that's maybe more common of a spelling but that was a shocker!",4,positive,0.9566715359687805

Mostly I am left with the fond memory of my grandmother's favorite and oft repeated SPOONERISM involving a flummoxed usher abashedly redirecting a congregant:


Mardon me, padam, but you are occupewing the wrong pie. May I sew you to another sheet? Perhaps a chew in the back of the perch?

And I practically leaped into the air when WARM FUZZIES came in.  

For that one, I had to change NAB to RUB for ""catch.""  I thought of Hamlet, natch.

But what to do about NAZCAL?NES and ?OOMROASTED?  I tried all the possible ""dips"" -- FAILS, RAILS, BAILS, HAILS, MAILS, NAILS, PAILS, SAILS, WAILS.  None seemed right.  I wanted ZOOM ROASTED, but ZAILS is not a word.  I finally settled on RAILS (why? why?) and ROOM ROASTED.  Those roasts always take place in a room, right?  But what's BOOM ROASTED?  And why are dips BAILS?  You've got me.

I did guess right on IMOVIE/NAZCALINES -- even though I'd been toying with EMOVIE/NAZCALENES.  Well, at least there's that.

"This was a great example for me of how idiosyncratic knowledge can make a puzzle that might otherwise have been hard go quickly. 

Seiji OZAWA is likely obscure to many, but I grew up in the Boston suburbs as the son of BSO fans during his heyday, so that was a personal gimme. That Z plus the clue led to WARM FUZZIES right away.

I work on climate policy, and the main outcome of the 2014 UN climate talks in Lima, Peru involved the Non-state Actor Zone for Climate Action — a classic backronym. So with that second Z in FUZZIES, NAZCA_____ was easy enough. 

A Cobb salad is one of my go-to lunch items, so with AC in place I knew the ingredient we were munching on was some sort of BACON. The U above redirected me from naB to RUB, and it became clear that 31A was ____ROASTED. 

With most of the central stack in place, I could work out from there — and a puzzle that at first looked daunting ended up being done in well under my average time. Not that I’m complaining!

"I am not a lesbian. I am a middle-aged gay man, who on more than one occasion has asked my middle-aged gay Partner ""Who goes to gay bars anymore? and why?"" Certainly not for the sybaritic reasons I did in 80's-90's, since--like the giving of gift cards--such transactions can be more efficiently handled over the internet. Back in those days, when I was coming up (and out), back in my hometown of Cleveland OH, there were two lesbian bars--Five Cent Decision (later renamed The Nickel), which didn't welcome men; and another, a dance club on W 6th St., which did--it was known to have some of the best dance music in town, and was the go-to place on Tuesday nights, back when clubs had ""nights"". Alas, I can't remember its name; and try finding *that* on the internet!

I suppose as long as there are women with a zeal for appletinis, as well as other women, there will be lesbian bars, but they are becoming fewer and fewer in number: somewhere between 25-30 nationwide by some reckonings, but I suppose that depends on how you define the term. Does the presence of two lesbians at the same time, out on a friend-date, qualify it as a lesbian bar? Some resources:

"For me, this puzzle highlighted that great genre of clue – the delayed reward clue – where you don’t get it on your first visit, but you get it with a BOOM on your second or third.  

That brings about an exultant “Hah!”, followed often by a spate of madly thrown-in answers off of the letters you just inserted.  And suddenly you have a filled-in patch that was previously desert.  One of the great Crosslandia moments.

Then it happens again.  Each of these elevates the mood, and for me, todays puzzle had a bunch.  And, as the Beatles said, I feel fine.

Just as a reminder, Garret, now in his first year at the University of Chicago, had Andrew as a teacher in high school, and this is their fourth NYT collaboration.  It’s a warm fuzzy backstory that makes my heart smile.  

That center stack pulses with fresh energy – BOOM ROASTED and CRISPY BACON are NYT puzzle debuts, and WARM FUZZIES has appeared just once before.  The same holds true for that stack in the NW, where LESBIAN BARS and FRIEND DATES are debuts as well.  As a result, the grid is energized, filled with perk, absent of same-old.
