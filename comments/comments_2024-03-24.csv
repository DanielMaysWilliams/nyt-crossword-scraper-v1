"I quite enjoyed this puzzle. Had to kill off Sat's first, y'day eve. The arduous picking away at that puzzle made me appreciate the fluidity of this one all the more. Not sayin' it was supereasy, just wasn't uphill both ways.

For 21A snack-brand I 1st had fritO, then Juicy (tho I bet Juicyfruit is 1 word) even tho those're only ¬Ω the name. I liked 15A PEDI, needed a cross or 2.

Nice to see YOKO has a 1st name in the xword! So ubiquitous as her 3-letter surname.

I thought 1A wd be unknown‚Äî til I got the B & aha, it's a rhyme.

I found the theme amiable & cute. Unlike w/SamE, I felt I was kinda on the same wavelength as Constructor today.

I smiled at 27A when finally got it, as a kid I played tons of STRIPES & solids whenever there was a pool table around.

I liked that crosses were v fair & helpful for the more obscure-to-me entries, not nec. gimmes but helpful. Got many entries on 1st pass; as I say, wavelength.

Delighted at HEADCANON, I hung out on enough X-Files sites back in the day or #AllStarTrek to have seen ppl talk of their head-canon for what A's REAL relationship w/B was, etc! Even read one or 2 slashfics back during XFiles (don't google if u'r offended by BRA in the Xwrd).

Last square to fall was 41, had 35D HaWED as I didn't know 41A ELO, then realized HEW is cut, HAW is something else.

Liked the cluing!

Fun to see ref to the origin of jumping the shark, FONZ, even if they left out his 1st name (THE).

"After several glowing reviews, I have a bone to pick with today‚Äôs puzzle. HOLDSWATER? Is a castle a HOLD? It would be a KEEP, yes, and a STRONGHOLD, yes, but a HOLD? Hmmmm‚Ä¶

Anyway, as ever, i remain an addicted and devoted puzzler.",5,positive,0.5821917057037354
"Great Sunday puzzle! Intelligent cluing, fun theme, challenging enough to keep me at it for nearly 90 minutes.",6,positive,0.9861705303192139
"I needed some 10-15 lookups, and autocheck, to complete the puzzle. It was actually harder for me than yesterday's puzzle - themes such as today's are extremely cryptic to me, and on top of that most of the trivia was US-centric (which is fine, given this is a US crossword, but objectively fine can subjectively feel not so).

The clue for UMPS I still don't understand, even after checking the meaning of ""homebodies"". I know what an ump is, but I don't see a connection with the clue. The clue for STRIPES mystified me - but it was explained in the column.

ISUZU finally came to me, just as I was about to google it - it is a pretty niche brand in Poland, best known for failure-prone diesel engines in their horribly ugly pick-up trucks. Pick-ups are not very popular in Poland, and Toyota, Mitsubishi, Volkswagen and several other auto makers offer much better ones than Isuzu.

Over here vans are much more common than pick-ups as utility vehicles in small business and agriculture, and many people just hitch trailers to their regular cars - or tractors, in the countryside - because it's cheaper than getting a specialized vehicle. When I was a child in the 80s, horse-drawn carts were still a staple of Polish agricultural transport, but I can't remember when I last saw one of those. It must have been the early 90s.

I am also glad to have remembered GIL Scott Heron from a feature in The Guardian - I actually don't know any of his work, but his name is lodged in my mind.",22,negative,0.5609052777290344
"The area below the definitely correct GIL and WILLA took almost as long as the rest of the puzzle. I was stymied by the clever clue for GOLF SHIRT, my inability to see FUDGES FACTS, my unfamiliarity with poker slang, and my perpetual inability to remember that ISUZU still exists. I may also have had a typo in POOLS RESOURCES, but since I have trouble reading those long Down answers, I can‚Äôt be sure. 

I didn‚Äôt know that YOKO ONO had a dance hit, but the reference to her age made that a near gimme. (Madonna would have fit, but since she‚Äôs less than a year older than I am, I never thought of her for that answer.)

After yesterday‚Äôs challenging puzzle, it would have been humbling to have to peek at the answer key to have finished this otherwise breezy puzzle. But ditching AcUra and trying ISUZU broke that last area open.

Thanks, Mr. Kugelman!",18,negative,0.5180230736732483
"Hello, folks! I admit that even as the words were forming, I didn‚Äôt think of LAILA ALI soon enough because I was unconsciously seeking a male undefeated champion. Love her and the clue.

I was thoroughly floored listening to the language the BASQUES speak, especially knowing that it is close to the language of cave dwellers in that region more than 14,000 years ago. Fascinating! Did it sound like any language you‚Äôve ever heard? 

Domingo feliz!",10,positive,0.910570502281189
"I just really really loved this puzzle, it was a lovely walk through a garden of thoughts.

I literally giggled when I realized the HOLDS WATER (my first theme).

My last clue Do people need braces to fix their GUMS? no, their GAMS? Nope, it's their GAPS (and now I learned what a HASP is).

Thanks so much for this delightful start to my day.",13,positive,0.9714994430541992
"This week has been tumultuous. I‚Äôm not referring to war, politics, March Madness, or turbulence in my personal life. No, of course, I‚Äôm talking about the Wordplay comments section. If you were to tell a non-crosswording friend, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm feeling a little shaky because things got really heated in the crossword comments this week ‚Äî accusations of betrayal, elitism, wokeism, ignorance, and intense battles over whether Uh-oh is one word or two,‚Äù  they would likely burst out laughing or question whether you have been getting enough sleep.  One wonders what Walt Whitman would have made it of it all.

From ‚ÄúSong of Myself‚Äù (loosely connects with the theme)

Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems,
You shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions of suns left,)
You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in books,
You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me,
You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self.",62,negative,0.5449097156524658

"I'm always awestruck by the puzzle creators' eclectic and sizable wheelhouses compressed into grids of all sizes, with these gimmicks and themes woven into them. 

These clues are humbling and serve to remind me just how much I can stand to broaden my own range of interests, and gently stretch my active vocabulary to process the contexts of even the most deceptively simply-phrased clues.

I was thus thrilled when I caught on to today's micro-puzzle, and it looked like I was about to make a personal best time, when... a single typo hidden amidst this dense grid of letters threw my time off, considerably. 

My hat is off to John Kugelman for an esoteric, yet solvable (if only by crosses), Sunday grid.

Kudos, too to editor Joel Fagliano's tireless and timeless work, particularly filling in for convalescing Will Shortz. 

All my best to all.",45,positive,0.9399465918540955

"Very enjoyable. Like Caitlin I especially liked plant's evidence, with hold's water a close second. Didn't love Set's at ease since that's pretty close to sets at ease, but it'll do.  Deage is a debut and it's such a horrible little word I doubt we'll be seeing it again soon. Not sure where Caitlin was going in the gameplay column with her explanation of how to read ""fudge's facts"" -- like ‚ÄúI am delicious‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou deserve a little nibble of me, go on"" -- but maybe I'm too tired to get her quips; I just thought the ingredients of fudge, that is, the FACTS about fudge, include sugar and cocoa. I can also see I'm overthinking AND underthinking it at the same time.

Evel - Leap - Buses -- I still remember him jumping 14 buses! What a character.

There's also quite a bit of military or martial language in the puzzle, too: Pillage, Leads, Takes Orders, At Ease, Rout, Enola, On Leave, Sirs, and some slightly related ones including  Lose To, Dove, Tsars. One can't call all this a mini-theme, more a word-set that WANTS to be a mini theme. It's all about MEN'S GREED.

Simoleon -- a dollar -- is apparently a portmanteau of ""simon"" -- an old English coin worth sixpence -- and ""Napoleon"" a French 20-franc coin bearing the image of Napoleon III. It is the currency used in the game SimCity. Don't try to deage your simoleon by polishing it, that will lose its value.",19,positive,0.6481560468673706
"A relaxing way to enjoy a Saturday afternoon, leisurely strolling through this richly clued puzzle, like shopping at a flea market.  Some interesting finds, a few of the usual fillers, and some really terrific treasures.  A lot of lucky guesses, but no look-ups, and a pleasure to solve.  I came out the other side on a bit of a high.

Thank you, John Kugelman.",20,positive,0.9813327789306641

"Not being a daily commenter on Wordplay, I am sure I missed a notice, announcement or comments regarding the sudden departure of Will Shortz, replaced by Joel Fagliano since March 14. Does anyone know if this this a permanent arrangement, or just a well-deserved vacation for Mr. Shortz?

So far Joel is doing just fine. Friday's and Saturday's were super challenging but very satisfying solves, today's was great fun.",3,neutral,0.7347517013549805
