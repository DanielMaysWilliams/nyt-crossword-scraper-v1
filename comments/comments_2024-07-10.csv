"I did the puzzle today while doing a bit of a vacation road trip with my husband. Our trip overall has and filled with many delicious VIANDS! I'm shocked that so many of you didn't know that word! 

I jest, of course, and I haven't more than the last few comments yet. VIAND was the last to fill in for me. I was a bit leery, but I was also pretty sure of all the crossings so nervously I typed the last letter in and voila! 

I don't think I have heard that word before, at least not to my recollection, I'm assuming it's not a debut so I'll have to try to add it to my files. I'm going to try to associate it with the delicious VIANDs we really did have on this trip! 

In other shocking news, what!?  Quiet Riot didn't originate Cum on Feel the Noize! My shock at this one is real! I knew it wasn't 1973 that they did it, so I didn't try to do a rebus or anything to fit it in, but I did have to wait for some crossings to come through for me. ü§Ø

Anyhow, I enjoyed the puzzle, It kind of took me all day to do it because I only did it in quiet moments of our drive.

Today, the TdF had the tough uphills on the Massif Central... the third steep region of France.  And it was an epic, epic contest between Vingegaard and Pogacar, with the previously injured Vingegaard reincarnated winning by one wheel radius.

"And now, a thought about the puzzle:

Some have noted that the phrase ""Tour de France"" never appears in the puzzle.

The term GRAND TOUR, which is used to refer to that race without specifically naming it, is one that can refer to the Tour de France, the Giro d'Italia, or the Vuelta a Espa√±a, the three major multi-stage bike races in the world.  It is to cycling what ""Grand Slam"" is to tennis.

Problem is, it's not a well-known term outside of the cycling world, and it's not what solvers are expecting to enter.  Of course, Tour de France won't fit.  So it's a bit anticlimactic to fill in what seems like a generic phrase (even if it does have a specific meaning to the cognoscienti) in that key piece of real estate.

If I click on GAMES at 9:59:59 pm, the same day's puzzle will open (except on the weekends, of course.)  One second later, if I click on GAMES, the new puzzle will open.  Regularly and without fail.  Of course, on the weekends, this all happens four hours earlier.

Newer solvers may not remember, but there was a time when  every so often, enough to be annoying, the new puzzle would not drop when it was supposed to.  So solvers would busy themselves, come back fifteen minutes later, then half an hour later, until finally someone who had been asleep at the controls woke up from their nap and got things started.

This problem was addressed, and apparently corrected, and it's literally been years since the puzzle didn't open at 10:00:00 (6:00:00) every night.

"What a novel take on the Tribute Puzzle!  

Usually, tribute puzzles feature a dry set of theme answers related to the subject ‚Äì acrosses and/or downs ‚Äì and the revealer is the subject of the tribute.  The symmetry is the normal rotational symmetry, because the focus is not on the puzzle‚Äôs design, but rather on the subject of the tribute.

But looky here.  The subject of today‚Äôs tribute puzzle ‚Äì the Tour De France -- isn‚Äôt even in the grid!  The theme answers include diagonals going up!  The symmetry is diagonal (as if the puzzle is folded on a line going from the NW to SE corner)!

And it works!  Those diagonal answers in the circles climb like the cyclists scaling the mountains.  The diagonal symmetry subtly gives that climbing feeling as well.  And how brilliant to leave TOUR DE FRANCE out of the grid?  We all know that‚Äôs what this puzzle is about, why waste the space?  We learn in writing class that suggesting rather than telling is more effective, and I found it marvelous in this puzzle.

The greatest bicycle racer in history, Eddy Merckx, won elven Grand Tours, a record which still stands almost fifty years after his retirement, along with other accomplishments at all types of events and distances in his career.",11,neutral,0.4931863248348236
"Nice puzzle. 

And thanks Sam for reminding me of the terrific film ""Les triplettes de Belleville"". I saw it with back in the day when it was first released (2003) and I was still going to movie theatres. I read today that it lost the academy award for Best Animated Feature to ""Finding Nemo"". Really ???",10,positive,0.8420541882514954
"So many references I didn't get. Slade? Ned Rorem? Cloris Leachman? Simu Liu? Albert Camus? Lots to google after this. Maybe I'm just uncultured or a clueless millennial (or both?) but the struggle was real.

I have never heard ""viand"" to describe food, and I'm even studying French and connected ""viande"" as meat. ""Usury"" was also a new word for me.

Maybe I could have worked this out if the crossings were nicer, but I needed lots of reveals to finish.",11,negative,0.7312445640563965

"As an ardent watcher of the Tour De France (as much for the spectacular views of the French countryside as the cycling drama), I enjoyed this race themed puzzle, and it came together quite quickly for me.  This year‚Äôs Tour seems like a foregone conclusion, with an in form Tadej Pogacar looking likely to run away with it and to reclaim the coveted maillot jaune from Jonas Vingegaard.  It was, however, heartwarming to see the entire peloton embracing Mark Cavendish after his crafty sprint captured his 35th stage win to make him the all time leader in individual stage wins.",11,positive,0.9556808471679688
"Hokey smoke, Bullwinkle! With the wit and humor present in nearly aspect of Hal's little gem, in the construction, clues, concept, et. al., I enjoyed every moment of the morning's ascent. Thanks very much for this complete delight.

It helps to simultaneously listen to Magdalena Kozena sing Monteverdi's ""Zefiro torna"" to brighten each of those moments. 

This promises to be a great day.",16,positive,0.984179675579071
"Managed to work this one out but have to confess that even when I was done I didn't entirely grasp exactly what was going on with the theme. I kind of get it now, but my brow remains furrowed to some extent.

Speaking of furrowed brows - stumbled across a puzzle today that I can promise I would never, ever have managed to complete. Must confess that I still don't entirely 'get it' even after looking at the solution. Anyway - a Sunday from May 21, 1995 by Dean Niles with the title: ""Celebrity types.""

"I didn't know the Tour de France was called the Grand Tour ! I appreciated typing in CHAMPS ELYSEES, it's not an easy one to make fit and certainly a nice tribute since the Tour is skipping it this year. Darn Olympics!",7,positive,0.5984166860580444
"Lots of cleverness, and I am familiar enough with the Tour de France to have gotten many of the references right away, so I thought this puzzle was for me.  Then I got bogged down in some opaque-to-me references (Slade, TSP, dyad, east, to name a few).  The play on ""cycle"" also left me cold, as one of my pet peeves is people saying vicious cycle instead of vicious circle.  Oh, well.  Glad some of you enjoyed it.",1,neutral,0.6262407302856445
"I‚Äôm not normally one to complain, as I think that most seemingly offensive crossings or grid patterns are a complete coincidence rather than malicious, but I was surprised to see clues about usury and Judaism crossing. 

Overall this puzzle didn‚Äôt quite click for me - too many obscure references - but I enjoyed the cycling theme.",6,negative,0.5233707427978516
"How delightful for two of my obsessions to collide with this Tour de France NYT crossword! (Hopefully everyone‚Äôs collar bones are OK.)

"Overall pretty enjoyable; I definitely appreciated the pun.

I couldn't for the life of me figure out 52 across though. Never heard of an ERG or USURY and would never in a million years have thought of OED. Tough one.",4,positive,0.5243107676506042
Loved this one. A few unfamiliar clues but nothing I couldn't work back from (apart from hoosegow)...,5,positive,0.9528726935386658
"Really not my favorite. Too many entries were focused on the theme which I had no idea about and were unable to be intuited, crossing with entries you can‚Äôt guess if you don‚Äôt know (is that what people call crosswordese?) like SLADE or CAMUS or TINAS. 
Definitely a lot of good entries in here, I liked PASTTENSE and REALIST especially, the creator is clearly skilled. But not knowing what the Grand Tours were really made many bits of this crossword inaccessible without cheating. 

To be fair, if I were to make a crossword I‚Äôd almost certainly fall into the same trap of making the theme something I‚Äôm really invested in but not everyone is, and then saturating the grid with it.",17,negative,0.6610367298126221
"Wow - I guess I‚Äôm the only one who absolutely hated this puzzle. I‚Äôve never heard of the Grand Tour, so that probably doesn‚Äôt help - but even so:

ALBA and LOPE; SLAMMER (hoosegow???) and SIMU; SLADE crossing CHAMPS ELYSEES, NED, and LEACHMAN, with EELED right below (congers??); VIAND crossing TINAS. I don‚Äôt know if these are all just very non-American references or what, but this felt more like a Friday to me than a Wednesday, and I‚Äôm shocked there isn‚Äôt more grumbling in the comment section.",88,negative,0.8304793238639832

"Solving this puzzle was a joy ride.
Everything fell into place, with no resistance, and not because it was too easy, but rather because it was masterfully constructed, with a tight theme and beautiful fill (CAMUS...CHIANTIS...ALBA...

Speaking of I's, or rather eyes, is there anyway that the NYTimes could allow users to tweak the font colors?

"A thoroughly enjoyable puzzle. I loved the theme, especially VICIOUSCYCLES. 

Even though I heard SLADE more times than I cared to as a youth, I couldn't pull the name out until I had several crossers.

"Two bits of arcana. First, ""Camus"" was a bicycle manufacturer in France of road bikes in the 1970s and 1980s. I had a friend who rode a Camus and swore by them, even though I'd often see him pushing it endlessly uphill, like Sisyphus. You can still find Camus bikes on ebay. I never cared for them myself, preferring my three-speed Sartre. They're no longer being made, having faced an existential threat. My wife had an old De Beauvoir bicycle-built-for-two (the additional seat was for the Second Sex). 

Second, Camus was well known for dividing his work into ""cycles,"" each cycle being a work of fiction, a drama and an essay, all on a single theme or philosophical idea. I don't know how many different cycles comprises his oeuvre but that's how he thought of them. 

Love this theme, having been just the age that ""Breaking Away"" was MY favorite movie as a teenager. Then I got hooked on the Tour de France during the Lance Armstrong era, and I still kinda miss him, he was captivating and weird. (Leachman is an anagram of Lance Ham -- and he was a bit of a ham, and his excuses were rather ham-handed...which is what people with fat finger syndrome often end up being). 

Also enjoyed the pairing of SAT SHIVA with REAR UP and the presence of STEPS CLASS in a puzzle about biking. And between chianti, rye and a hot toddy, I might just say ""Scusi"" a few times as my bike wobbles off the road.",63,neutral,0.7749670743942261
"What a playful theme. I love the debut of CHAMPS ELYSEES. and the wonderfully punny VICIOUS CYCLES. 

Nice crossing of GRAND TOUR with TRIO. 

It would have been a hoot if the aerobic exercise had been Spin CLASS.
