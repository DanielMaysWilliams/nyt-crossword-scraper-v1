"Leapfinger, oh Leapfinger!

I saw your post on the Wordle Comments section but they had closed it to new comments by the time I saw your name. Nice to see you too!! Not riding the motorcycle for a couple years now, after getting COVID made me very weak in the knees I have some trepidation about getting back on it. Some weeks my resolution to get back on it is stronger, sometimes it is weaker. The way of all flesh alas...

Actually Wordle has solved its spoiler problem by closing the Comments section specific to a particular day long before the next day's puzzle is posted.

Anyway, hope to see you there again. I usually finish the Saturday crossword puzzle too late to write posts on Wordplay that anybody's going to read, the crowd having flocked over to commenting on newer puzzles by that time.",3,positive,0.7972396016120911

"A few hours ago Steve L posted a play list of three songs relevant to the holiday today. I enjoyed all of them and was appropriately moved. While I was watching these a teaser scene for a completely unrelated YouTube video appeared in the upper right corner. ( As this is in no way relevant to Steve L‚Äôs post I certainly didn‚Äôt want to enter it as a reply.)  It was an interview with Steve Poltz, of Rugburns and later Jewel notoriety. In the video he tells a remarkable story of a meeting he had with John Prine. Anyone with some free time on a (hopefully quiet) holiday afternoon may want to take a look at this:

"Sorry here but I am not a fan of the latest crossword editing. The puzzles over the past few weeks have been much easier and less challenging as a rule. When I can knock out a Friday puzzle in 30 minutes, and a Wednesday in15 I am less than satisfied. Yes there are some signs of interesting construction but in general I find the misdirection clues more plebian.
 I now look forward to solving much less ardently.",3,negative,0.8436880707740784

"Encore, encore!

The constructor wrote ""I‚Äôm not sure what led me to settle on O.E.D. and DOESKIN. I probably should have gone with RED and something starting with DRESS.""

I think maybe he should have for some bonus theme-adjacent material points. ""Dresser"" as in set dresser or costume dresser might have been nice.

"Well, I knew we were either making a movie or producing a piece of theater, but I never thought the revealer would be something as mundane as PUT ON A SHOW.  I was contemplating something more like THEATER BOXES or HOLLYWOOD SQUARES.

OTOH, it's Monday.  And Monday is allowed to be mundane and chock-full of GIMMEs.  

This is a smooth, well-made grid that's almost completely completely free of proper names -- and for this I must GIVE PROPS.  But it's impossible for me to get excited by a puzzle that's so lacking in challenge.  I did learn that a BEARD is a symbol of marriage for Amish men.  I thought they all wore them.  So there's that.  Anyway, I'm hoping for more challenge tomorrow.",4,neutral,0.520919680595398

"A lovely set of GIMMES for a quick Monday, but, I say old bean, a scone is not a pastry. It‚Äôs a moreish, firm, cake-like delicacy, preferably served warm from the Aga, with lashings of tea. Sadly denied me since I gave up the demon sugar.

"Classic Monday theme, well executed, and elegant, given that the show words in the theme answers carry a different meaning than what they mean in the theater.

Biggest takeaway for me was learning super-shutout GOLDEN SET.  

I let my eyes gaze for a few moments on the completed grid, and they kept seeing connections:
‚Ä¢ Lovely word ladder in the West, with SEES / SEEP / PEEP.
‚Ä¢ A given-name fest: UMA, MARK, ELENA, ANGUS, VERA, ISAAC, PETE(s), and wannabe HUE.
‚Ä¢ A string of schwa-tails: PINA, INCA, TUNA, UMA, ELENA, VERA.
‚Ä¢ Two answers that make proper names when ‚Äúline‚Äù is appended: AVE and VASE.
‚Ä¢ Long-O enders: CAMEO, ECO, PICASSO, AMIGO, EMO, VIRGO and wannabes PUTONASHOW and RESEW.

Best moment for me was when, after seeing all these theater words, suddenly, in a reprise from ‚ÄúGypsy‚Äù, whose LP my mom played often in my youth, the epic tune ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs Coming Up Roses‚Äù started playing in my head, sung brassily by Ethel Merman. I couldn‚Äôt get rid of it, and I don‚Äôt want to!

"Cute theme and a smooth Monday solve. A number of things that weren't dawning on me immediately but everything fell together with some crosses. Not quite a record time, but well under my average.

15 letter answer that dawned on me today, inspired by 10d, was VIETNAMVETERANS. That was an answer once - in a 1998 puzzle. 

And... 10d was quite appropriate for this day for me. With apologies, will just note that my former company commander, who has remained in touch with us after all these years, late yesterday posted a list of names from early 1970 for Memorial Day. 47 names... over a 5 month period.

"Not quite a PR, due to clumsy typing, but I really ripped through this, in some cases filling in the answer without even looking at the clue because I could see from the crosses where it was headed. Lots of fun.

A trivia detail (not a complaint): according to my dentist, nobody has used novocaine in decades. Even the thought of it seems barbaric. I don't remember for sure what the current popular variant is, maybe xylocaine. (And maybe both of those should be capitalized.) But the clue didn't say it had to be a current product, and novocaine is certainly the colloquial term.",5,positive,0.7878808975219727

"5D got me to thinking about the true origin of the concept of the ‚Äúblind carbon copy‚Äù.  I didn‚Äôt have the patience to spend long enough to explore the web as fully as I might, but I did find one comment suggesting that the term pre-dates the internet, which is what I had always thought.

Back in the good(?) old days, when we used carbon paper to make duplicates of letters prepared on a typewriter, one would simply add the letters ‚Äúbcc‚Äù to the carbon copy intended to be sent to someone (B) other than the intended recipient of the original letter (A).  In this way,  B would know about A but would realize that A would not know about B.

Speaking of typewriters, I am reminded of an incident when Sam was quite young, but old enough to be  comfortable with the use of computers and their peripheral devices.  She came into my office at home and was fascinated by an IBM Selectric typewriter sitting on a desk.  She wanted to know what it was.  I fed a sheet of paper in and turned the machine on.  Then I began hitting a few keys at random to show her how it worked.  I went back to my desk and listened as Sam experimented with the keys.  Then she caught me off guard with her question, ‚ÄúDad, how do you make it print?‚Äù",27,neutral,0.8304200768470764
