"I had fully intended to write about this puzzle. But, it being Monday, I both completed it early and then got very busy with Monday things. Oops! 

It was a lovely puzzle, buttery smooth fill that was enjoyable and surprisingly quick (even for a Monday). Not at all boring! 

I loved seeing PAULA Poundstone at the top of the grid. I feel we are overdue for a Netflix special or some such from her. Or bring her back for the political conventions -- I'm dating myself, but she was great at covering those in the 90's! 

Far and away my favorite today:

I could totally feel the joy and SURPRISE with that one!

"I tried once again to guess the revealer after leaving it blank and filling in the theme answers ‚Äì something I‚Äôm weak at and working to improve on.  It gives me a hill to climb on Mondays rather than one to sled down on, much to my brain‚Äôs delight.

Today I did see the connection between the last words of the theme answers, and that‚Äôs as far as I got.  I‚Äôll count it as a win-win, at least figuring that part out, and it satisfied my brain‚Äôs work ethic.  My crusade continues!

This puzzle had a bouncy and fun feel ‚Äì not surprising, considering the constructors, and some lovely serendipities:

"Always happy to see another ACME enterprise and wasn't disappointed by this one - no Bodily harm to the construction either. Pretty typical Monday solve - was close to having everything filled in before I tumbled to the trick and that's always a nice 'aha' moment. 

Looking at the puzzle on Xword Info, saw something I'd never noticed before: ACME - 86 puzzles - never a Friday or Saturday. Mr. Bodily - 10 puzzles - never a Friday or Saturday. So they've both only ever done themed puzzles. That's... fascinating. 

And, a couple of very interesting puzzle finds today. I'll put those in a reply.

If the clue for 60A were simply, ""Boy, is that loud!"" without the  ""or a hint to the ends...""

"Nice puzzle. Perfect for a lazy Sunday night.  Interesting solve and clever clues.  Mondays are always easier and more straightforward.  This one had a little misdirection and longer solves which was lovely. A palate cleanser for the week. Crisp, clean, cool and satisfying.

"Great puzzle, but I can always use music, so of course my brain zeroed in on STING, and I went straight to a song that's the opposite of a RACKET, devoid of NOISE, and free of TRICKS like auto-tune. 
The bossa nova shout-out to RIO fits right in, and of course it doesn't hurt that the CAMERA absolutely loves him.
