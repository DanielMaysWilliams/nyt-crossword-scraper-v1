"Great puzzle with some really nice clues! 
The only disappointment was how quickly I solved it. I really look forward to sitting down on a Saturday and delving into the puzzle, and the last few Saturdays have been slightly harder than normal for me, but this one was less than half of my average at just over 17'.

1A and 41A were my favourite clues.",0,positive,0.9227985739707947

I thought 46a was a wee bit tricksy. At least it would have been if this were a domestic cryptic but as it happed, since neither of my first two guesses worked and my backup idea of putting Santa Fe in wasn't a fit, I got there through the crosses.

"That was quite the rickshaw* ride! I finished a hair below average but with no lookups or check puzzles today, as do most/all of my previous Saturdays and I finished this one way faster than yesterday's. 

That said, no happy music and I couldn't find what was wrong. I briefly wondered if it was one of the TRAPS just because I don't think I often see words repeated... I felt pretty sure of everything else, so I ended up consulting the key‚Äîalas, it wasn't completely look-up free. I had GEe instead of GEN, thus eFT instead of NFT. 

The north and mid west came rather easily but the south and mid east were very hard. For a while down there, I was only confident of DEPP and MEN. Loads throughout that I put in and took out when they didn't serve me well on the crossings, especially Quito instead of SANA'A. That came out pretty quickly. My geography game continues to serve me well though. Before it, I'd have not heard of SANA'A. 

*Rickshaw was a big part of my downfall yesterday. I completed most of the puzzle on my own but I couldn't bring the NW home. Having rickshaw instead of MINE CART didn't help. I've watched all the Indy movies but I can't keep 'em straight. And I didn't know the proper pronouns up there and after putting it down and coming back many times, that area still remained a mystery so I had to do four lookups up there!

Sam Nunn, Bill Roth, Robert Byrd, Strom Thurmond, Trent Lott, etc. Same goes for AOC, and last week we had Beto O'Rourke, whom I'd already forgotten. I cringe on behalf of future archive solvers.

"A lovely grid filled with colorful long answers and almost no names.  It started out somewhat challenging for me and then got whooshier as it went along.  It was the long answers that helped me most -- and I'm especially grateful to you, ELECTRA COMPLEX.  I got you just off your ""L"" and then the whole bottom came in quickly.

3D was tricky.  The answer could be EYE or EWE and I had EYE.  So BROWNIE BATTER took a long time to see.  Don't get me started on GOSS, which is truly awful, but it's the only bad answer in the puzzle, so I'll forgive it.

The hardest answer for me was for the clue ""One might get a meal wrapped up.""  I had the ""B"".  BUN?  But I was pretty sure that Harry Potter is an ORPHAN.  So then BO-what?  BOW?  Would you wrap a meal in a BOW?  Does a BOT ever wrap a meal?  A BOY?  So confusing.  I finally realized that it was BOA, giving me the opening vowel I needed at 37A, ""what you will.""  Oh, it's an ASSET.  I was expecting an ESTATE, but, hey, easy come, easy go.

The top and left sections  were most challenging for me.  Thankfully, CEASE AND DESIST just came out of nowhere,  I considered literalism at some point (didn‚Äôt fit), before I figured out that Spanish Miss is SRTA.

But yes you can‚Äôt let the long clues overwhelm you - just try, try till you die lol!  Eventually you figure out that it‚Äôs PORT (not pier) AUTHORITY, ELECTRA (not Oedipus) COMPLEX.  I date myself by knowing immediately that it would either be PAULA (or Janet) with the hits record.  

Favourites today : ON A BREAK, WOMB, BOA, RENT MONEY.",7,positive,0.8980703949928284
When I first laid eyes on the grid I was a little worried because of all those long answers.  And I came up with almost nothing on the first pass and realized I was going to need to do a lot of guessing.  Luckily most of my guesses hit their mark and I ended up finishing in half my average time.,9,negative,0.7161489725112915
"Sorry, Caitlin, but Putting in the Ritz is forever associated with Young Frankenstein.  
https://youtu.be/ab7NyKw0VYQ?si=VyNjdAUTIhG7lY6T

A clever, well-made puzzle, whose top third had me flummoxed for quite a while. Was chuffed to figure out what the rebus pronoun clue meant only to come up with EyE instead of EWE.

For those keeping score at home, I found today's puzzle tougher than yesterday's.

Cheers to all.",21,neutral,0.5851461291313171
"This was my first intro to the Saturday crossword and, I gotta say, I didn‚Äôt have fun",4,negative,0.9083318114280701
"This is the kind of Saturday puzzle I most enjoy: One that I can solve without getting too stuck anywhere, but that requires me to think a bit. 

The 1A AGE OF MAMMALS clue is cleverly misleading. I didn‚Äôt know 13D BEAR TRAPS but it wasn‚Äôt too hard to figure it out. 

I was surprised to learn that little factoid about SANAA. I expected the answer to be something like Quito. I guess I never realized how mountainous the SW corner of the Arabian Peninsula is. 

The bottom half was easier for me that the top. It took me longer than it should‚Äôve to get the X of 19A X-RAY LAB/19D XED IN. I kept looking at the surrounding answers and verifying that they were correct, but the X just didn‚Äôt occur to me, until it did. 

My time ended up being 20 seconds longer than my time on Friday‚Äôs puzzle. If I hadn‚Äôt had trouble with the 19 square, I‚Äôd have beaten my Friday time. 

As for 52 PUT ON THE RITZ: ‚ÄúYoung Frankenstein‚Äù all the way. 

Thanks, Mr. Sheremeta!",13,positive,0.8100191950798035
"Please help: Why/where is OLE a cheer you hear in  a soccer stadium? In German-speaking Europe it definitely isn‚Äôt. The clue comes up weekly and I am wondering every time. Does it refer to LA OLA, the stadium wave?",4,neutral,0.5183351039886475
"Wow, a third of my time from yesterday I think I would have switched the Friday and Saturday puzzles this week. Generally long stacks are easier because once you get a few short downs they start filling in themselves. Don‚Äôt get me wrong loved both of them.",5,positive,0.9032989144325256
"Duh.  Felt like a dodo when my first pass netted nada, and was prepared to carp about some ""maybe"" meanings. Then I took another look, and saw a bit of sophisticated cluing in the puzzle.  The smiles started racking up and I found that I was having a very good time, oh yes.  TRUEDAT TOTHEMAX.

Daniel Sheremeta, thank you!  We could use some more of these.",36,positive,0.8226009607315063
"Wow.  This puzzle really won me over.  First it seemed almost too difficult, with very few toeholds.  But in the end it was pretty fair, and I began to appreciate some of the clever cluing.

Starter home, line for the shower, place to stick the knife in, all good stuff, as Carson might say.

Once some of the long ones began making sense it all ended rather quickly.  I enjoyed this.  Misleading in that it turned out much easier than it seemed.",43,positive,0.9563384652137756
"I enjoy the challenge of Saturday puzzles. Once again, my grid was mostly empty before I came to this column & its comments. Some of my fill was wrong too. Solved with help from here.",12,positive,0.8146544694900513
"I was much quicker than yesterday - not sure what that means.  I think there was more 'young 'un' knowledge in the Friday puzzle.  My daughter was much quicker than me yesterday - if she is slower than me on today's it might help to confirm my theory.  If not, of course, it just shows how I am slowing down in my old age.  I'll let you now.",15,neutral,0.6244707703590393
"Kicked myself for not remembering ELECTRA COMPLEX, but still found this to be a satisfying and surprisingly quick solve ‚Äî surprising since for the first 50% I felt totally stuck. Love when a puzzle clicks into place like this one!",12,positive,0.8532261252403259
"The grid was very intimidating at first, but I'm very proud of myself for completing this puzzle without a single look-up or hint. That is a rarity (for me) on a Saturday!

I'm not saying it was easy.... a lot of the clues had me scratching my head. I didn't have many acrosses filled in on my first pass, and a lot of my downs were incorrect. When I realized it was the AGE OF MAMMALS (a clue that had me stumped to its meaning) that helped me clear up the entire top section, and the rest flowed from there.

The trickiness of the clues was enough to make this an enjoyable solve (""one might get a meal wrapped up"" for BOA was a favorite), but adding in quite a few unique fills raises this puzzle to another level.",25,positive,0.8543848991394043
"My very first Saturday completed without help! I solved my first Monday puzzle (with help) for the first time during the pandemic some 4 years ago, after spending years thinking ""I don't get crossword puzzles, they're just not for me"". 

I'm guessing this means many people will complain that it was too easy for a Saturday. Maybe I'll be one of those people one day (although I certainly hope not)!",57,positive,0.6991540789604187
"Lovely puzzle! On day nine of a streak (a personal best!) and thoroughly enjoyed this one.

However, I wanted to point out that there seems to be an error in the help column: it states that the answer for 51D is MRI, but there is no 51D. I think it was meant to be 50D.",19,positive,0.9456892609596252
Almost missed the ABC in the top left and the XYZ in the bottom right. Sneaking a bit of fun into a themeless puzzle perhaps? Fantastic stuff!,77,positive,0.9128787517547607
"Not quite the difficulty of a standard Saturday puzzle. Given the sequence in which I solved it (I got and X, K and Z early on), I was hoping for all 26 letters. Sadly only 24 made it.",4,negative,0.4785653352737427
I liked how 15D was complemented by the ends of the triple-stack on the bottom...,12,positive,0.9110366702079773
"I didn‚Äôt have much on this one until I got to the bottom.  The three bottom spanners came to me quickly and I worked my way upward with all deliberate speed.  I had a devil of a time coming up with BROWNIEBATTER, in part because I‚Äôd never heard of GOSS.  The real problem, however, was that I had overconfidently entered eye for rebus letter instead of EWE.  Eventually I realized that Y was just not going to work and tried W instead.  After that I was able to run the vowels to get the O for GOSS.  Fun puzzle and faster than I thought it would be when I started.",18,neutral,0.5869211554527283
"A nice challenge, but it was a little quick for a Saturday. Good looking grid (maybe a little scary at first glance). Switched my strategy of starting with the acrosses and moved to the downs.",6,positive,0.912230372428894
Tough but doable; the X was my last fill. It definitely felt like a Saturday puzzle.,24,positive,0.5400727987289429

faster than Friday.

Obviously, I have the
Friday and Saturday
puzzles reversed.

One of my TALENTS.

"About 4.5 minutes faster than the Friday puzzle, but I still found this one a bit chewy.

I was helped greatly by knowing ELECTRA COMPLEX as a gimme, and then saw PORT AUTHORITY right behind it as a reasonable guess.  When DEPP and ALOU fit as good crosses, I was sure of the whole lower stack, and although that alone didn't guarantee me a solve, it gave me a good chance at a bottom half that looked impenetrable at first.",17,positive,0.6224033236503601
