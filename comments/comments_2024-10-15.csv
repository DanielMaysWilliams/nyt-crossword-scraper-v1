"A lovely, classy grid with no junk.

Even though I solved it as a themeless, I still pondered: what was the theme that tied the themers together?  It wasn't a letter thing and it wasn't a first word only or second word only thing, so it had to be an entire phrase thing -- which would make it much, much cleverer and produce more of an ""Aha Moment"" -- RIGHT?

Such an ""Aha Moment"" it didn't turn out to be, alas.  The RIGHT= correctly thing seemed a bit vague.  It works well with CREDIT CARD since there is a right way and a wrong way to SWIPE -- and I should know because I so often swipe the wrong way.  And I suppose the right way to swipe for a PICKPOCKET is any way that doesn't get noticed.  But I don't know if there's a right way and a wrong way to insult people or a right way and wrong way to do MMA fighting, whatever that is.

It didn't matter to me.  I appreciated the lack of crosswordese, textspeak, initialisms, pop names and all the other things that uglify so many puzzles.  A very nice Tuesday.",7,neutral,0.5298059582710266

Also, entering NOTIP I realized something I have known for ages, apparently, but have not thought about until today. In English it is possible to leave nothing behind, or to leave no tip. Polish doesn't allow that. Over here you can only say you did not leave anything behind, or that you did not leave a tip. In other words, in Polish you can't leave a lack of something: you can only not leave something. ""Zostawi≈Çem nic"" - ""I left nothing [behind]"" - consists of valid Polish words but is not a correct Polish sentence. The Polish negation in such sentences must associated with the verb, not only with the noun (I'm sure somebody can put that better into words). I'm glad I must have learned this organically as a child because it would be a very unnatural and abstract thing to grasp for an adult.",24,neutral,0.4834992289543152

"Quick witted. I'd swipe right on this for sure!

There should be a dating site for puzzles, don't you think? Not constructors or solvers, the puzzles themselves. Let's call it PUZZLR. First you post a picture of yourself, maybe half filled in (an alluring look) & then work on your profile:

""I like hidden Easter eggs, sports themes, my ultimate fantasy is a sextuple stack.""

""I like oreos, rebuses, listening to Eno & Ono...""

""I can be difficult and I don't suffer fools, some would call me hard to get. But I'm worth it.""

""I'd like to engage in coaxial symmetry with someone on my wavelength."" 

""I'm pretty easy and just looking for a good time, preferably under four minutes."" 

When puzzles find a match, sometimes it can be a real success. I've known puzzles who met on PUZZLR & now have families. One couple down the street now has two minis and a pet wordle and the latest Dodge Acrostic sedan.

OK, before this riff gets old (lotta ways to go with it, but brevity is the soul of wit) congrats on this debut: solid effort!
