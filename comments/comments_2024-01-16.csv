"Maybe I was just having an off day, but I found this to be much harder than a typical Tuesday puzzle! 36D felt like a joke to me but without the typical question mark (maybe it‚Äôs a usage I just don‚Äôt know ‚Äî I know the military one and the idiom), a wrong guess in 37D that also fit (CULTHEAD) left me stuck for ages, and a handful of them were just celebrity names I didn‚Äôt know, with too little wiggle room to solve by context.

2. A year later, I read that the hotel the Tonga Room was in was kicking them out. A big rally formed to ""Save the Tonga Room!"" A friend said that he would be there, so I came and waited for him. At the bar by myself. For two hours. He never showed. Eventually he texted me that he read the place wasn't closing after all, so had decided not to come.

The one-L rule for grid entries reminds me of a classic problem in chess: the eight queens puzzle, in which you have to place eight queens on a chessboard (8x8) such that none threatens any other.

My solve - very smooth except for the NW corner. Never heard of TFAL and that just had me doubting my other answers and pondering alternatives for a while. Finally just went ahead and filled it in.

"Marshal may only have one L but you more than make  up for it with the extra R and N in Herrmann. 

Early week puzzles are fun to try and speed solve, but the problem with a speed solve is you miss the beauty in the detail of a puzzle. In my rush to finish, I only read the first half of the revealer clue and didn‚Äôt realize the staggering feat Marshal Herrmann pulled off with the Ls

On one hand, I‚Äôm proud of myself for instantly knowing ONE L with only half the clue. That answer completely stumped me a couple times last year but now it seems to be another bit of crosswordese I have added to the vault. 

On the other hand, I think I‚Äôm ready to chill on always going for a PR on Mondays and Tuesdays. Would have had way more fun with this if I took my time and I don‚Äôt think I really care to try to topple my records anymore. Would rather enjoy the calm before the late week storm. 

Thanks for the fun puzzle, Marshal! Amazing work. Congrats!",17,neutral,0.47373294830322266
"In a rare occasion, this one didn't really resonate with me... I finished it well under average but felt only meh about it. But that's okay. And maybe I'm just... in a pet... I learned that a day or two ago in the crossword hahaha!  It sounds like it was a hit with most other people and that's awesome!

I do have a question though, 53A ""Movie theater eponym"" - LOEW - what does that mean?  Also, what is One L as pertains to a law student? 

I loved seeing Zora Neale Hurston represented!!",3,positive,0.6474292874336243

"Very impressive construction‚Äîit's difficult enough to create a crossword, but to limit all the answers to include one L maximum and minimum is quite an accomplishment.

Great NYT debut, Marshal, and thanks!",19,positive,0.9591902494430542

One of those puzzles where I am amazed at the ingenuity of the construction. I solve pretty much top left to bottom right so I had almost all of it before the revealer and of course I hadn't spotted it.  In some ways it's a shame - the theme and the construction are awesome but it didn't really help much in the solving.,9,negative,0.4027421772480011

"I've probably spent the last 20 minutes or so marveling at this grid. Truly amazing, Marshal (with one L, 2 R's, and 2 N's).

It's particularly tricky in the corners with the 4x4 blocks, where the L's may have to be distributed across the first, second, third, and fourth positions of the answers, as seen in the NW and the SW. That explains the need for TFAL, which I've not heard of. Other than that, this puzzle is junk-free.

I had a FIELD DAY with this one.",11,positive,0.9505916237831116
