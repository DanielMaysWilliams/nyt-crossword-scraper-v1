"You could say that Edison‚Äôs invention of the incandescent light bulb was the lux fiat of our modern electronic and media-centered world. As with the account of the creation in Genesis, everything else follows from it.  The clue to 72D refers to an ‚ÄúAmerican icon,‚Äù and Peter Koetter‚Äôs grid is iconic of the Menlo Park wizard‚Äôs achievement, with the light bulb at its center, and his other inventions positioned around it like the planets orbiting the sun.
 
66D: SPIRITPHONE --  a 1920 project that didn‚Äôt quite pan out (one wag called it his ‚Äúdial-a-ghost machine‚Äù) --  might give the impression that he dabbled in mysticism. That couldn‚Äôt be farther from the truth. Edison gave a lengthy interview to the NY Times in 1910, which still makes fascinating reading. ‚ÄúSearching the inner structure of all things for the fundamental,‚Äù the interviewer notes, ‚ÄúEdison told me he had come to the conclusion that there is no ‚Äòsupernatural‚Äô or ‚Äòsupernormal‚Äô as the psychic researchers put it ‚Äì that all there is, that all there has been, all there ever will be, can or will, soon or late, be explained along material lines.‚Äù

"THOMAS ALVA Edison was born in the village of Milan, Ohio, about 13 mi. SSE (that's sur-sur-ESTE) from SANDUSKY, Ohio. His family lived there until he was seven, at which point they moved to Port Huron, Mich. It's a big deal in that part of Ohio: There's an Edison Woods Metropark, Milan and the neighboring Berlin Hts. share in the Edison Local School System, and the Edison Bridge crosses beautiful Sandusky Bay, connecting the ""mainland"" with the Marblehead Penninsula.

And of course, his family's home has been turned into the Edison Birthplace Museum, but nowhere near as scary as the one in West Orange, NJ, as the Johns can tell you:

My grandmother called one day and happily talked with each & everyone of our 7 family members. We children had never met Minnie so this was a very special occasion! ...The next day, a telephone repairman (they were all men at the time) came to our house to repair the phone. My father told him our phone was working fine last night, my mother called & talked to everyone! The repairman said that's impossible, all the phone lines have been down for the past 3 days.

Nipper, the cute terrier, was the trademark for The Victor Talking Machine Company (later RCA Victor).  Eldridge Johnson, founder, would be most unhappy with this egregious error.  The technology of EDISON's PHONOGRAPH was quite different (even superior).  However, Edison's business acumen fell short, and Victor was, well, the victor.

But as odd an answer as GAMELAN is, I would not have made it my word of the day as Rex did.  My candidate for that honor would have been SPIRIT PHONE -- surely the most eye-opening, surprising answer in the puzzle.

EDISON tried to invent a phone that would communicate with the dead???  (How right you were to put that in italics, Peter!)  A true genius like EDISON really believed that such a thing is possible???  Enough to work on inventing some sort of gadget for it???

"After a brutal Friday, when I had to throw in the towel and look at the answer key for the half of the puzzle that eluded me, and a tough Saturday, completed, but took forever, I thought this one  was like a Monday. Sailed right through it, but it was fun.

My favorite clue was 38D - Something that's big with the current generation - POWER PLANT.

But I also enjoyed Dr. Koetters' notes. He mentions ""fluoroscopy."" This current generation has no first-hand knowledge of it, but it evoked several memories for me: going to the family doctor, who had a separate room strictly for his fluoroscope, which he used frequently. Even the kiddie' shoe store had one, and they fluoroscoped our feet! That, together with playing with liquid mercury from broken glass thermometers, as mentioned by Deb Amlen the other day, makes me wonder how some of us old-timers are still here!

At least I remembered TOJO and SANDUSKY just from the clues. Center section was the last thing I filled in and that took a fair amount of pondering.

In a bit of post-solve grid gaze, I liked seeing ERN next to ERNO, OVER over OVER in the SE corner, the PuzzPair¬© of ADAM and EAVE, and I liked seeing how MICROPHONE is vertical, resulting in a mic drop.

"I found this to be a very fun puzzle! One, because I loved the grid and B, because of a reference to one of my favorite movies, Tommy Boy, being in it -- Sandusky...  They didn't reference him but that's okay it still brought me joy. But I waxed on about that in an earlier comment already.

I also love the Yogi Berra quote! And I learned a lot because I didn't know about all of those inventions. 

All that said, I finished this in half of my normal Sunday time, which is a personal best by very far. I did have a hard time in the southeast but overall it filled very quickly for me, which is a surprising experience for me after Wednesdays. I don't think I've gotten that much better since last Sunday, so this might have been less difficult than I am used to on Sundays but I did have fun with it!

The theme came very quickly but for a while something I had in the southeast made me think, or wish, that maybe this was a sort of trick and it was really about Tesla. I was hoping that was the case. I pretty quickly disabused myself of that notion but I loved the idea of it not being what I expected and playing on the rivalry!",4,positive,0.9705882668495178

"About 18 years ago we went with the kids to vacation in Captiva, part of an island close to Fort Myers in Florida and one thing all of us remember vividly was visiting Thomas Edison's winter home in Ft. Myers, with Henry Ford's home nearby.  The main house was large and rickety, with a big porch and airy rooms, windows open to the elements, . There was much to look at, his inventions and memorabilia, his associations with other luminaries* (woohoo!) of the time -- but I began to notice dozens of lizards, perched alertly on desk tops,  scampering up the walls, and one peering down at us from the top of a four-poster bed, mainly brown and green anoles, though our older son spotted iguanas as well. No one seemed to mind them much, least of all the docents, but it was so at odds with modern museum conservation practices that I  was somewhat shocked (woohoo!), and could well imagine Edison getting on one of his Spirit Phones and barking out orders to get rid of the cussed things, why, what's the use of displaying his greatest invention, the Ionic Anoliator if they didn't use it once in a while for the good of humankind?!?! 

So glad this wasn't a Super Bowl trivia fest! Speaking of which, did you know Edison tested 1600 kinds of filaments (coconut strands, carbonized cotton thread, hair) before settling on carbonized bamboo? Sounds like 99% perspiration ... 1% luck!

""Sportscaster"" for Orel? Cmon! His genius (& 99% perspiration) was as a PITCHMAN.

"I told best beloved: ‚Äúoh tonight‚Äôs puzzle is about Thomas Edison‚Äù.

A few of his remarks made it apparent he was talking about Thomas Jefferson.

"Caitlin writes of trying to strike a balance 
in a tribute puzzle. For me -- not for you 
nor for anyone else -- the balance tipped 
too much to the easy side. And I don't
consider myself an Edison maven.

The grid visual and a themer clue or two 
gave me the honoree, and the theme answers 
went in right away. It did take a cross or two 
in the southeast to determine whether 
THOMAS or EDISON would be in the circles. 
I found the non-theme fill too easy 
to call entering it a slog. 

I hope other solvers 
found the puzzle more challenging 
and/or more rewarding than I did.",15,neutral,0.7015843391418457
"Just going to take this moment to vent about some of my biggest crossword pet peeves:

Proper nouns crossing
""Poetically"" being used to mean ""we made up a word""
No consistent spelling for the contraction of U-Turn

"I've been scratching my head about Caitlin's assertion that REPINE is crosswordese.  To me, crosswordese consists of words that are both (a) not commonly used in everyday conversation or writing, and also (b) commonly found in crossword puzzles (mostly due to their common letters).

REPINE has only appeared 27 times, and only eight of those have been in the Shortz Era.  In fact, its last appearance was a dozen years ago.  Half a dozen for the time before that.

Eugene Maleska only used it three times, and Will Weng just twice.  Weng waited almost a decade to use it for the first time.  The first editor, Margaret Farrar, used it 14 times between 1942 and 1965.

So it would seem to me that it might have been crosswordese (although marginally so) 60 or 70 years ago, but it hardly seems like crosswordese today.  

To me, it just seems like a rare word that finally found its way back into a puzzle.  I suspect that 60-70 years ago, it might not have been as uncommon a word as it is today.",17,neutral,0.7148017287254333
