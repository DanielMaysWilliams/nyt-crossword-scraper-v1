"I read the clue for 13A, I pictured the mascot, I knew it was the 
Phillies ‚Äî and blanked on PHANATIC. 

It was another sports answer, 20A COLT, before I finally saw something I could fill in. The lower half ended up being much easier than the top half (except for 15A IDAHO and 10D SANTA HATS, everything took a bit of work).

I‚Äôve got a few albums by Courtney Barnett in my collection and a few songs by Kurt Vile, but I must have missed their collaboration. I‚Äôll have to give it a listen. 

Thanks for the fun, Christina!",6,neutral,0.7620688676834106

"It‚Äôs a royal shame the NYT does not recognize a proper noun, even when it‚Äôs the name of a neighborhood in its hometown. The Great Elephant Migration, featured in the lead photo of this write up, is at home in the Meatpacking District. Imagine referring to a story taking place in times square or the upper west side or red hook. In fact, you cannot, because they could only take place in Times Square, the Upper West Side, Red Hook, and accordingly, the Meatpacking District.",10,negative,0.763147234916687
"I have heard of the PHANATIC (Thank you It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia) but never saw it written out so I couldn't finish the NW until I looked that one up, along with LOTTA. Not bad for a Saturday, although it always feels better with no look-ups. Maybe next week...",6,positive,0.5175816416740417
Very well done!  Top notch puzzle.,22,positive,0.9817386269569397
"So fun, thanks Christina. So many favorites, hard to pick one, so I think I'll go with CHER near the ELEPHANTS, as she's been involved in rescuing at least one from a terrible life in captivity.

And loved the pic of the ELEPHANTS residing in the meat'packing district district,  Caitlin.  I hope everyone who can goes to see them.

Can Christina do all the Saturdays?
No? Guess I'm living in my own Private IDAHO.

"After struggling with Friday, so glad to be at Saturday.  Loved the long entries.  APPOLLO had me guessing would it be era or a cave.  And lord knows I only know the provinces of Ontario through British Colombia by auto-recall so PEI was a good reminder that there are other provinces east of Toronto. 

Great job!!",9,positive,0.9621372222900391
"Cute clue for MAMA (what else could it be, right?)

It made me think back to this probably best clue ever for MAMA :
‚ÄúLeft tributary of the Vitim River in Irkutsk Oblast, Russia‚Äù
(See puzzle of 4/1/20 in case you don‚Äôt remember.)

Don‚Äôt we have fun here?!",26,positive,0.9665005207061768
Best Saturday puzzle in a long time! And it was the final part of a Christina Iverson triple header (after doing strands and the mini). I knew I was in for a good time when I saw her name on the xword.,21,positive,0.980932354927063
"Despite the fact that many things in this puzzle were in my wheelhouse, I found it to be a stiff challenge.  I knew the Phillies mascot (the PHANATIC), but I suspect that will pose some unfair problems for non sports fans and non US puzzlers, especially with the idiosyncratic spelling making it a little harder to intuit. I was also familiar with LOTTA Sea Lice, because Kurt Vile is a local artist who I‚Äôve gone to see a couple of times, thus giving the NW a distinctly Philly flavor and me a gimme.  But there were plenty of tricky clues and general knowledge questions that were unfamiliar to me, so I had work pretty hard to get it all. I found trailer homes for THEATERS and the clue for WINDOWWASHERS particularly piquant (I loved the double Ws). And I enjoyed POLYMATHS just for its own sake. I‚Äôll be interested to see the response to this one.",19,neutral,0.5827652812004089
"I greatly enjoyed this puzzle! However it was quite the emotional rollercoaster between the satisfaction of immediately recognising the trick of 18A, the frustration when struggling with the Down clues that crossed it, and the brutal realisation that the woman in ‚Äòdire need‚Äô was not, in fact, IRENE. Sneaky stuff, Christina!",18,positive,0.8458796739578247

"That was tough. I basically worked from the bottom up, and eventually got through the NE corner. So many things I did not know.

"I was cruising along in near record time and then ran up against the northeast. It killed me for a while, until I got 10D and then it all filled in nicely, but added an extra 50% to my time.  Really liked 18A, 27A (got it with only the middle two letters) and 57A from my childhood.  Good puzzle.",12,positive,0.8435289859771729
