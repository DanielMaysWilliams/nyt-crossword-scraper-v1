"Hi, I'm new to puzzle comments with a longtime peeve that's probably been explained: why the heck does the Times make Monday's crossword the default halfway through Sunday? 

Here in California, we don't see Monday's Wordle, Spelling Bee or Connections until after 12:01 am Monday, Pacific time. That's as it should be. So why do we have to go to the Archive to see the Sunday puzzle when it's still Sunday?",2,neutral,0.6135804057121277

Loved the theme! Thanks Aimee Lucido.,4,positive,0.98634272813797
"I always enjoy a good literary theme! HIGHFIDELITY was the first one I got and the only one I didn't know as a book, so I had to wait till the next themer before I understood it. 

Oh, how I dislike THE GIVING TREE!  Such a short but disturbing tale of interpersonal dysfunction and extreme selfishness, in my opinion. It made me shudder a bit at the clue and answer at 65A instead of chuckle... But that's just my own personal bent, not a gripe. I know it's a beloved book for many. Anyhow, there were far more smiles in the puzzle than this one shudder!  

My favorite was spell book for MERRIAMWEBSTER! I'm also always a sucker for the clues that are ""Apt name for ___."" And Herb was no exception!

I wasn't familiar with 14A GAS in that context but the crossings were easy enough to get it. And it made me think of ""Money, it's a gas..."" which is always fun and brings good memories! As does RADNER. 

Fun learning that those two movie lines in1A were ad libbed! I had no idea!

"I was breezing along and heading for a Sunday PR until I hit a roadblock, not recalling the names of 73A and 81A (though I'd heard both before at some point). Eventually figured them out from the crosses.

86A brought to mind a story. Some years ago I needed a root canal, and the endodontist has a large selection of films that the patient could watch during the procedure. Wanting some lighthearted entertainment that I knew I would enjoy, I chose ""Finding NEMO"". I did not recall that this film included a scene of a patient undergoing a painful root canal! When it got to that scene I groaned, as the kind endo assured me that I would not be experiencing that kind of pain in his office (and he was right). In any case, once the procedure over I got a good laugh and story to tell out of the experience.",12,neutral,0.7165038585662842

"Question for longtime solvers. 

On occasion, commenters mention that a clue or an answer break a rule of crossword construction. Yesterday there was SANTA being an answer and also appearing in a clue, which some noted is not permitted. Others countered that a specific word cannot appear in both the clue and its answer but there is no prohibition on a particular word appearing in both a clue and a separate answer in the same puzzle. 

I‚Äôve read Margaret Farrar‚Äôs standards for crossword construction and the NYT guidelines and specs.  Is there another recognized source for crossword rules that addresses the above? Or is it more something that one understands from experience? My hunch is that it‚Äôs the latter. 

It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve wondered about for a while.",6,neutral,0.8398953676223755

"This one was an enjoyable struggle for me, and it felt good to finish it. One gripe: I'm getting tired of ""feh"" and ""gawp"" and other clues that just seem like one-letter distortions of other words meaning the same thing. Where is an old bat like me going to encounter such nuances??

But other than that, no solving surprises -- though I was very surprised by one theme clue:

Was FRANKENSTEIN assembled from scraps???  I didn't know that!  Of course the fact that I never read the book or saw any of the movies means that I know zilch about FRANKENSTEIN.  Even better, FRANKENSTEIN knows zilch about me.

"This theme charmed me.  The conceit is elegant and carries with it a lot of fun, because every theme answer is a guessing game, trying to figure out the title from the first word of the clue ‚Äì with as few crosses as possible.

With some themes, once you figure out the gimmick, boom it‚Äôs over.  But when each theme clue/answer turns out to be a fresh riddle to crack, as today‚Äôs are, the fun doesn‚Äôt quit.  And yet the clue-to-title engine driving the entire endeavor is so simple ‚Äì again, to me, charming.

Along the way, it was lovely to revisit Jim CROCE and Gilda RADNER, two loves who‚Äôve been hibernating in my subconscious for far too long.  I took a moment to hear his voice and see her face, and my day is richer for it.

"Fun, maybe a little too easy, although I didn't solve especially fast.  Didn't love the theme for some reason; the construction felt slightly shaky to me, but as I look back now it's pretty tight after all.  :)  I'm not well read and the only book I didn't recognize was High Fidelity (though I know of a movie by the name).

For a brief time I had sash instead of belt, crossing with hung instead of teed.

I enjoyed Yearbook, which was a basically a long gimme.  :)

Anyway, a nice quick Sunday jaunt.  Thanks.
