"If Ms. Robbins hadn‚Äôt told us she‚Äôs a retired librarian, I would have taken her for a classicist, though of course there‚Äôs no reason she couldn‚Äôt be both.

"OMG -- The theme answers are SO good!!!!

When you have a change-a-familiar-phrase-into-a-wacky-one type Sunday theme, there are only two tests that matter.  1) Are the wacky answers funny, clever and even inspired rather than being forced and TEPID and 2) Are they accurately and fairly clued so that the solver has a sporting chance of getting them with just a few crosses.  

This passes both tests with flying colors.  I got most of the themers with very few if any crosses:  EXCHANGE WEDDING VOWELS; PACK YOUR BAGEL AND GO; WHAT'S PASTEL IS PAST and YOUR DELAYS ARE NUMBERED.  I had NOEL, but needed crosses for the rest; I knew it was PEELER something-or-other; and I couldn't get the truly magnificent DON'T GET MAD, GET ELEVEN without lots of crosses.

I laughed out loud over every single one of them.  They are all so funny and so original and so well-chosen.

This was a delight to solve. Thanks Mrs. Robbins!",23,negative,0.6958770155906677
"Great puzzle but there is an error in one of the clues. ""Selling Sunset"" is a Netflix show, it's not connected to Bravo in any way. From someone who solves most crosswords while watching a Bravo show, I should know!!!",39,negative,0.5353390574455261

"I liked the theme but not the fill. EMEERS is just not good. Way too much junk in my opinion. I‚Äôm glad I read the column before posting, since I too was confused by ‚Äúno elfly zones‚Äù. NOEL FLY ZONES is the highlight for me‚Ä¶now that I see it",32,negative,0.8068137764930725
"A 50 minute solve for this Sunday‚Äôs edition.  The ‚Äútwo by two‚Äù clue threw me for a loop as I had the wrong word for one of the down clues (the surfer‚Äôs hazard).  A little trial and error for a few minutes provided me with the correct answers.  

To Ms. Robbins, thank you for a fun puzzle to solve for this Sunday!  I was able to get all of the ‚Äúel‚Äù clues with little difficulty which gave me a lot of down clues.",14,neutral,0.6386322975158691

"TELOS, LAMBDA, GAIA, GEMINI, ASTRA, and even OLIVE TREE. It‚Äôs all Greek to me but happily ‚Ä¶ I know Greek!

ZOO too, actually. And ‚Ä¶ what were the discussions for cluing AGAPE? You can‚Äôt get more Greek than that, can you?

Also: hat tip to SERE, ANIL, SAL ‚Ä¶ blast of the past! How did Mel Ott, Gordy Howe, and Bobby Orr not get invited to this party?",24,positive,0.6965231895446777

"I have done every NY Times crossword since 1969. During these 55 years, whether I liked a particular puzzle or not, I always marveled at the talent of constructors and their ability to create a grid. Now Ms. Robbins joins this elite group. Nice job. Very entertaining. Don't be a stranger around here.",75,positive,0.9606915712356567

Heimlich maneuver.

Nice puzzle. The constructor might be my doppelganger. So many oldy-but-goodies! Haven‚Äôt seen ANIL in years, and WELBY brings tears to my eyes.
