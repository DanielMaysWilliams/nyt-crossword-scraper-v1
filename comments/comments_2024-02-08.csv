"First, thanks to all who welcomed me back so graciously yesterday.  I'm glad to be back.

I think I've lost my rhythm because of the long hiatus.  Today's puzzle took me longer both to solve and to spot the gimmick than in should have.  As I was finishing, and as I (finally) filled in the revealer, I got about half the gimmick.  I saw the reversed words and enjoyed the way they worked.  What I didn't get or at least didn't see, was the juxtaposition of the paired entries.  Didn't see it at all until I read Deb's explanation.

Oh, well. the good part of the long hiatus is the archive:  I can go back and do several puzzles a day as I continue to recuperate.  I'll get my rhythm back pretty soon, I think.

Anyway, I should have a fresh start.  Fittingly, today is my birthday.  I'm now 82.  I've read that doing things like XWPs is good for the brains of the elderly.  We'll see.

It would have been enough to flip the verbs and prepositions in those 8 expressions, but it was doubly clever of you to match the opposites as you did, and spell it out in the revealer to boot. 

Needed to solve for LIN and SMH on the crosses. Mobile APP felt right, but I was fixated on the Iditarod when I read ‚ÄúLead dogs‚Äù  and was looking for ATEAMS or ALISTS instead of ALPHAS. No idea where (or in what act) Lear talked about wind chap, but HEATH made sense.

"Some people have been defending the naysayers, saying they have the right to express their opinions.  They do, but if you have a negative opinion, you should make sure that it's the fault of the puzzle...

If you think a clue is lame, and everyone else is praising it, maybe you should consider that there might be some aspect of it you don't understand.  Maybe you're missing the A-HA moment.

If you think this puzzle is ""more gimmicky nonsense,"" maybe you're not getting the logic of the more complicated puzzles (not just this one, because you said ""more"").  Nothing about this puzzle was nonsense, and rather than calling it ""gimmicky"", I'd say that it had more layers of cleverness than one might first notice.

If you call a puzzle ""nonsensical and exclusionary"", all you're telling us is that you haven't yet reached the point where you can crack the code and appreciate the complexity of the puzzle.  The fact that you are in a distinct minority should tell you that maybe it's not the puzzle.

Understanding the full dynamic of the play makes this puzzle a pretty extraordinary construction. 

One note: the idea that canine pack structure has ALPHAS (52D) who are the lead dogs (or wolves) was based on some pretty lousy research and has long been discredited, but sadly lingers in popular culture as a description and justification for a particularly boorish, stupid and misogynistic form of male behavior.

"Lots of suffering, especially in the NW, before I got to the revealer and figured out the trick.  Without knowing it, PASSOVER is ungettable and I was wondering what sort of PASS_____ there is to get you across a highway?

Of course I didn't know the Austin Powers catchphrase, and CAPTCHAS, as fiendishly clued here, was also a mystery.  I was NEVER going to crack the NW!

I was cursing the puzzle early on and thinking I might just throw it against the wall.  But once the scales fell from my eyes, I had to admire the trick and all my suffering ended as quickly as it had begun.

Where did I suffer?  At every single revealer, that's where.  But while I had few crosses to help out in the NW, the area around the revealer wasn't too hard and that eventually came in to my great relief.

I'm always saying that the only good puzzle trick is one where you can't solve unless/until you figure it out.  This definitely was that.  So I'm left saying: ""Be careful what you wish for!""

"What a pro you are, Samuel A.

A lovely puzzle could have been made simply focused on answers whose beginning and ends could be reversed, like HAND OFF and OFF HAND.  But that wasn‚Äôt enough for you.  First, as you mention in your notes, those reversed answers had to have completely different meanings.  That boosts the quality of the theme.

Then you added the ‚Äúopposites attract‚Äù motif, that is, you found pairs of answers that fulfilled the above condition, AND contained opposite components, AND fulfilled the requirements of symmetry!  Wow, and once again, what a pro you are, Samuel A.

That motif, where the answers had to be reversed to fit their clues, AND that the reversals happened because the opposites ‚Äúattracted‚Äù each other, well, that is a spectacular double-whammy theme you made.  A delectable riddle to spar with, not to mention that it was woven into  a milieu sparked with ‚ÄúHah!‚Äù-inducing clues.  For me, pure pleasure.

"Whew. I guess I shouldn't be too surprised that everyone else found this one easy. For me? - might be the longest time I ever spent on a Thursday puzzle.

At least they were placed synchronously, so that did help in the end.

"Super fast Thursday until I spent as much time searching for my error as I did filling the grid. In the end, JPEG cost me my gold star.

Oh well, not knowing anything about the Spice Girls except that one of them married Beckham, I never would've found my error.",5,negative,0.7147437334060669
"I love how ‚Äúpat down‚Äù and ‚Äúdown pat‚Äù have such different meanings.

Did we have another puzzle somewhat recently with similarish word swaps‚Ä¶
hmmm‚Ä¶.

Because I don‚Äôt have the memory of the last six months of puzzles down pat, I shall now proceed to pat down the archives to try to find what I think I‚Äôm remembering. Stay tuned.",20,positive,0.6549419164657593
"Like ""Sam Donaldson""... I had the same reaction when I first saw puzzles by David Steinberg. I wondered if that was the same David Steinberg who appeared on Johnny Carson's show 100+ times. (Spoiler alert: nope.)",10,neutral,0.7186934947967529
"(Second attempt.  The first one may show up later, or even at the same time, so apologies in advance.)

Some moments of my solve:

Got PASSOVER not long after starting, mostly because of the crosses, and said to myself, I've never heard that word used for highway crossings, just a Jewish holiday.  But at that point, I didn't connect it with OVERPASS, thus not picking up on the idea that the words had to be turned around.

It took me longer than it should have to get the next section, particularly because I had --NEA-- in 17A and decided that ""Family tree"" had to be GENEALOGY, and therefore we were dealing with a typical Thursday rebus.

Of course, that was not the case, and I moved on with the area incomplete.

I got the revealer, 40A, but that simply got me to realize that PASSOVER was just a reversal of OVERPASS.  I was probably going too fast to realize that these answers had to be the opposites of the adjacent words to fulfill the revealer.  But the information that I had to put in eight compound words or eight phrases with the words reversed got me through UNDERGO, ORDER IN, OUTLAYS, and so on.

It was only when I reached the end and reread the revealer clue, that I noticed that OVER was paired with UNDER, IN with OUT, etc.  A major 2D moment!

A brilliant concept and a brilliant execution.",11,neutral,0.7678297162055969

A nice gentle Thursday and quick by my standards - I usually have an excuse on a Wednesday night for not getting on with things that I have left undone but not tonight.   I saw the theme pretty quickly; and once I had the A of NACHO I was convinced that we wanted ALA for Mobile ____.  That took a while to delete.,6,positive,0.6159575581550598
"I‚Äôm not going to say this was an excellent Wednesday.  It was, but I‚Äôm not going to say it.  But but but, I wanted a Thursday.  I really really really wanted a gnarly Thursday!  I was almost counting it.  Strike that.  I *was* counting on it!  I mean, NYT, what about my needs?  I‚Äôm not having a tantrum here.  I‚Äôm not.  But what about a rebus or two?  Themers hidden inside black boxes, running outside the grid, diagonally and upside down, nothing but French clues, themers that make sharp turns, words that make no sense until they do, hidden marriage proposals, emoji clues . . . ?  Sure, a subtle and clever ‚Äúopposites‚Äù theme is fine and all . . . for a Wednesday.

‚ÄúHey Puzzlemucker?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù 
 ‚ÄúOH BEHAVE!‚Äù  
‚ÄúYeah, you‚Äôre right.‚Äù 

Loved it!  Thanks Sam.",41,negative,0.3807632327079773

"Interestingly enough, I was standing on line for ice cream one day, probably about 20 years ago, on Martha's Vineyard, and Sam Donaldson was on line a few people ahead of me.

The newsman Sam Donaldson, that is.

I didn't talk to him, because that might have meant mentioning that I was a loyal NBC News viewer...still am.

Of course, it was years before I knew that Sam Donaldson the crossword constructor...er, the future crossword constructor...existed.",11,neutral,0.7483448386192322
"Just opened the crossword as I do every night, only to see that my stats have been erased.  I have completed the puzzle every night for more than 100 nights, waited to see the gold star to be sure it registered.  And tonight, I am credited with 1 puzzle.   Pretty disappointing.

Anyone else having this problem?",2,negative,0.7648091912269592
"This was easily the most magnetic crossword puzzle I've ever done.  I got qute a charge out of it.
