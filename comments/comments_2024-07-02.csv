"Quite a disparity about the LENAPE/BELA cross.

Some people, myself included, thought it was essentially impossible.  There simply was no way out if you didn't know at least one of them.

Others found it to be a gimme.

It seems to me that most of the people who hated it are from somewhere other than the Northeast states.  And most of those (one exception that I found) from those states thought it was almost unpatriotic not to know LENAPE.

I think Barry was so aghast that I didn't know LENAPE that he dropped his hammer and probably his chisel on his toe in astonishment.  Hope it didn't smart too much, but also that it didn't smart too little, either.

Their territory spanned from what is now Delaware north to southeastern New York, including all of New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania. Their language survives in the names of rivers, hills, towns, long after their descendants were forced to move out to the midwest.

Where I grew up, toponyms like Wissahickon, Conshohocken, Wyomissing, Wyoming, Tulpehocken, Aronomink, all echoed the language of the displaced Lenape.

Oto/Otoe, Ute, Hopi, Erie, Cree, Crow, and others make frequent enough appearances in the puzzles to be dismissed as ‚Äúcrosswordese‚Äù (a term I dislike greatly).
