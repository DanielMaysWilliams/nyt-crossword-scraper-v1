Figured out the second trick with BELIE.  I thought it might be possible that a metal marble could be a STEEL, but I knew that ""contradict"" couldn't be BEL.

My only very minor gripe would be too many of the theme entries involving popular culture or proper names.  But even if I don‚Äôt know much about Ellie Goulding, Kylie Jenner or two and a half men, I have at least heard those names.

"If you don't have access to a POLYGRAPH. here's a pro tip from Interrogation 101: people tend to glance to one side or the other, depending on whether they're answering from memory or imagination.

I SHARE A CAB; if you SPLIT a CAB, they can get you for destruction of property.

And when I reached the student loan clue for 41A (despite zero experience with those programs) I thought of SAL-aha!-LIE .
It certainly helped with the tribe of K-ridden Kardashians.

This was quite clever, and I hope they don't do it again.  
Ha ha just kidding.  I love tricks, gimmicks, puzzling puzzles, and (sigh) I still miss Charles M. Deber's brilliant offerings.  (You can look them up.)

So smart.",17,neutral,0.5380319356918335
"I really enjoyed the trick of this puzzle -- thought it was clever and unique, even for a Thursday. The only negative to me was that it depended so much on proper nouns for the theme-related fill (both for the missing LIE or the rebus squares).

"Fun, slightly challenging.  It took me a little while to understand how the spikes worked - how can there be LIE and LIES and LIEV?.... Oh.... Let me fix that up.

On the other hand, it's scary that the constructor's first puzzle is already rebus filled.  Sigh.

Miscellaneous notes:

1. Mew is not pronounced anything like moo.

2. Oh Pooh is pretty weak.

3. So is Nine PM.

4. Never heard of Meeple but that's probably on me.

"I have a very different interpretation from Rex -- and I'm writing this comment as though I hadn't seen his column:

So clever -- and a first, I think -- to hide your rebus both in white squares and in black squares! Whichever rebus you see first, you'll think THAT's the color square it has to go in, and you'll be fooled.

I saw the WHILE SUPP[LIES] LAST rebus first, so I assumed the rebus went in the black squares. This was confirmed by the black square rebus of NON-BE[LIE]VERS and CHAR[LIES]HEEN -- so was I ever surprised when LIE also appeared in the white squares of EE[LIE]R and SAL[LIE].

And what to do about the rebuses being ""seen three times"" in the puzzle. But there are more than three! Aha -- yes. They're NOT ""seen"" if they're in the black squares, are they? Dilemma solved.

I knew way ahead of time and without reading the clue that the revealer would be LIE DETECTOR. Except it was POLYGRAPH. Oh, well, I got the main idea of the puzzle.

My theory of the puzzle, for me, works better than Rex's, since I don't see why a rebus square should be ABOVE the words that are being affected. But you decide whose interpretation you like more.

"I did have one satisfying accomplishment working this puzzle:  figuring out the theme/trick, although it did not happen early on.  Unfortunately, I gave up on this one.  

I spent a lot of time trying to solve the MEW/MEEPLE/ELLIE crosses running the alphabet a few times since Allie, Ellie, and Ollie seemed possible, and did not know MEEPLE, and MEW took awhile to gain hold.  Once convinced that was not the problem, I found an error elsewhere.  And then another error elsewhere.   And then another error elsewhere.  Still no music.  The error I did not find was ITSbAD/bUN.  Not up on my British tabloids.  I was convinced ITSbAD was correct, so I blindly accepted bUN.  

Had this been a gold star finish, my time would have been about double my average. 

Despite my troubles, I welcome Rena Cohen on her NYT crossword debut.  Discovering the theme made it all worthwhile.

To our columnist Deb, regarding ‚Äúreply all‚Äù: In the somewhat early days of everyone having and using email in our government department (CFS), the nation-wide departmental servers were crashed by some truly astounding mob-mentality that took over when an innocent person sent a local invitation to the national distribution list. All it took was one or two to send a snide ‚Äúreply all‚Äù and for some reason, almost everyone responded (all) in kind.

A couple of early errors slowed me down.  With CH__ in place, 26A had to be CHER, and Share A CAB sounded good until it didn't.

This trick was excellent with a couple of layers. EELIER and STEELIE told me there was a rebus, and I eventually figured out that you had to bump up to finish the answers, but why?  Ah, a SPIKE in the POLYGRAPH!  How clever!

I hope to see another creation by Rena soon.",14,positive,0.7162923216819763
"This was the first time in my approximately 4 years of doing the NYT crosswords that I've completed a puzzle with rebuses without filling in the rebuses.

STEEL and CHAR SHEEN were gimmes that I didn't immediately fill in. SALL and NONBE VERS finally kinda keyed me in to what was going on, and I was able to enter CHAR SHEEN confidently after getting those. 

Everything else fell into place, although sometimes slowly. ShareACAB messed me up for a little bit. (I'm in rural Maine -- what do I know from cabs? Or Uber or Lyft, for that matter.)

I assumed the black squares held the extra letters, and the crossword gods allowed my ignorance, which was particularly kind, as I see now in the completed puzzle that my black-square hypothesis made no sense. 

Anyway, nice puzzle! Well-constructed and clever, and for some reason it mystified me, which is cause for joy.

Completely off topic, last week I did some initial work with acting coach Carol Fox Prescott, and she taught me about breathing through the mouth. That may have changed my life. I'm still assessing. I thought I'd mention it here, though, in case anyone who reads this also suffers from a seeming lack of oxygen in daily life.

Closer to the topic at hand, I learned about the various ways the letter Œº is pronounced.

"Finished now. There was no way I would ever have been able to do this on my own. So many words I did not know, further obfuscated by the theme I was not smart and observant enough to understand. I mean, I am not particularly intellectually challenged, but there *is* something simple about the way I perceive the world and the puzzles in it. I am a bit like my dog, Jorge the lab: he is the smartest dog I have ever had and he is absolutely great at stuff he has already experienced. He also learns new things quickly, when instructed - many a time he grasped in one or two tries many tricks beyond the ability of other dogs. Still... Throw something new and complex at him and leave him alone with it, and often he will just stand there, tilting his graying head, trying to compute but failing, and often resorting to barking at the novel and incomprehensible. You know how dogs and their owners are often very alike? Today I proved I am like Jorge, just much less cute (nobody smiles at *me* in the street).

I know about rebuses. I know about dashes. I'm reasonably good at solving puzzles with either. However, a combination of the two was beyond me. I was so fixated on the dashes I failed to take into account a rebus might be part of the equasion, too. This led to the blunder of unwittingly looking up a themed entry. It all went downhill from there. Feeling dispirited, I let mental fog engulf me, and I was done for.

"I have not finished the puzzle yet - but I already know it will be one of my worst failures since starting to do NYT puzzles last year. I am simply not on the constructor's wavelength, I don't know most of the trivia, and my method of dealing with such cases has proved to be my undoing today.

I had very little on my first pass. I did a slower second one, sadly without much success. So I proceeded as I always do in such hopeless cases: I started looking up the trivia. I saw no other way out, but I don't really like doing that, especially on Thursdays, when there is the risk of looking up an entry that is actually themed/part of the trick, without there being any indication thereof. And that's exactly what happened: one of the bloody Kardashians, of all people, crossing natickly with some sinister American company with a perversely cutesy name, spoiled the rebus for me üò¢

Even after lookups the grid was still largely empty. I shrugged and turned on autocheck. I have very few ideas what letters to try where. There will be a lot of brute forcing in my further attempts to fill the grid. In fact, I feel I may break down and just reveal entries. And I still haven't grasped the other part of the trick, the one with the dashes...

"I actually liked the puzzle clueing and answers. Nice debut. But the theme just did not work for me at all. It initially appears that the ""lies"" are hidden in various black boxes, perhaps evoking the idea that you want to conceal any untruths from the polygraph. This idea works cleanly for the three across answers that are split by the putative black boxes of deception. But then other answers both across and down fall a bit short of concealing the whole lie in the box, like STEEL[IE] and BEL[IE].  If that were the theme, it would be an obscure and weak one, but at least consistent. Instead, the theme is that ""lies"" are rebus ""spikes"" sitting in the middle of just two three-box spike sequences, but not the center one, and one atop a lone random square in the puzzle? Nope. Doesn't work. It's not supposed to be easy, but this one and the one two Thursdays ago appear as though the original theme became too difficult, so they smushed it around to complete the puzzle.
