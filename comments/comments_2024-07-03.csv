Delightful fun. I don’t get the nitpicking of some. It’s a puzzle.,4,positive,0.9563533067703247
"I didn't like today's crossword. There were too many answers that didn't make sense even after they were revealed. E.g. 19 across (marked, as a box): XDIN... The answers are supposed to be accessible to the general public, either through research or recall (once they ""hit"" you). I got that the answer was ""exed in"", but there's no way a person could double check ""X'd in"" because it isn't even common shorthand for ""exed in"" (it exists as the name of an engineering firm, and that doesn't connect to the clue or the answer at all). The creator and editor assumed that everyone would just recognize it/accept it as valid, but I've never seen it shortened that way, anywhere, ever. That answer wasn't clever- it just came across as lazy to me.

As for 41 across (metal detectors?): ICHINGCOINS; I enjoy abstract concepts and niche subjects in crosswords but this was neither. That answer was too much of a reach and didn't connect to the clue. ""Coins= metal""- great- but I Ching isn't a translation of or a homophone for any word that means seeking OR finding, so to simply put it there in front of ""coins"" makes no sense. If a person knows of the I Ching and how it's used then the answer makes even less sense. The clue gave no indication that there was a book involved in the answer, nor did it give a hint as to which direction one should search in. If someone has never heard of the I Ching before, how are they even supposed to know WHAT to look up or double check?",3,negative,0.7228350043296814
"Very late thought--
Several persons, including Sam herself, drew connections between today's puzzle, and yesterday's Magic Eight-ball. But I don't believe anyone has made the connection with 34D--a Magic Eight-ball is the *other* valid use for a 20-sided die.

"It's funny how some puzzles can make you feel like a genius and others make me wonder what line I was in when God was passing out brains. Probably the taco line, I reckon! Today was the latter.

Anyhow, I'm not a MEAN Girl, so the puzzle didn't GO SOUR for me. I still had fun and learned stuff. Somehow, I managed to fill squares with letters that ended up being right without lookups or helps. I don't blame anyone who uses them but I am trying hard to keep building my crossword muscles and not go back to them. So it took more time than usual but if I have nothing else in the world, I have GRIT. And usually tacos and Diet Coke. 

I live in MN Vikings territory so 48A had me puzzled, but that's what I'm here for, I guess! In the crossword, that is, not MN. 

I CHING COINS... no idea! That was my toughest, by far. After getting the first two themers, I confidently put OUIJA BOARD in with only a few crossings but I kept removing and adding things around COINS.

I rarely struggle with clues like 64A - word with this or that word, but I did not know golden MEAN, so I had to just trust my crosses, and of course I know there's a MEAN girls movie, though I've not watched it. Will read up more on the golden MEAN.

I'm listening to the lovely, ""At Seventeen,"" which I've long known, but, as usual for me, didn't know the singer's name or the dragon's name. Still, it seemed unlikely to be anything but A where they intersected, so I plugged it in last and huzzah for the happy music!",4,positive,0.588350772857666
"I never would have guessed that ""x'd in"" was the intended reading.

"A couple comments from behind the line:

1) Although rigatoni are certainly tubular (no arguing with the clue), their defining characteristic is their ridges; otherwise, they'd be called ""smoothatini.""

2) Canola oil is not extracted from some mysterious Canola plant--there is no such thing. It is actually Grapeseed oil. It's just that the Grapeseed Growers Association of Canada (where most grapeseed is grown) figured that no one would buy something called ""Grapeseed oil,"" due to the unpleasant connotations of the name. So they decided to market it, patriotically, as ""Can-ola oil.""

Decades ago I consulted a world-famous TAROT reader, back in my college days I plunged into the I CHING, and in my high school days, much time was spent with friends on the OUIJA BOARD.

Ah, one of crosswords’ hidden gifts, triggering long unvisited memories, bringing one back to former states of mind, bringing alive lovely locales and people long unthought about.  To me, reliving it in my head is far superior to a photo album.

For years the crystal ball resided on my desk at work and I often wondered if visiting clients had concerns that I was relying on divination rather than legal research to solve their problems.
