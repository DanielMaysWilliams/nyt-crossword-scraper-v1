"The only thing I don't like about Thursday puzzles is that they happen on Thursdays! And Thursdays happen to be the day of the work week that is absolutely hardest for me to focus on my puzzles. That is to say, I love Thursdays! But I am very late to the Thursday puzzle because it's Thursday.

Now, I could ask kindly for them to move the Thursday puzzle to Tuesday, which would be a much easier day for me to handle Thursdays, but then there would be some sort of existential crisis because it would not be a Thursday puzzle anymore. 

SORRY NOT SORRY that I got a bit carried away there....

Anyhow, enjoyed this quite a bit! Another no helps rebus solved under my belt and I'm loving it! I think this is my third one done without help! I'm almost a year old in crossword years so I'm feeling good about it! Sounds like it's considered an easier one but I'm okay with that. I figure the more I get under my belt, the more capable I'll be with the harder ones. 

I was pretty sure at RED-HANDED but I waited because I didn't have the revealer yet and wasn't sure exactly how it worked at first. And then figured it out at UNHAND ME before the revealer. And that helped me get SCOTCH AND SODA and CHANDELIER. 

Really enjoyed the clues for GASPS, JOKE, IOU, and EVENT and of course the fun theme! 

Also, for the first time in probably decades, I was talking to someone today about Abbott and Costello's who's on first routine!  ü§Ø  I hadn't yet looked at the puzzle!  What are the odds!?",7,negative,0.5612184405326843

I knew that this was a rebus and hand had to be it because getting caught red handed is the only way. I needed a little help, but finished the challenge handily.

Cheers from Texas. It was 102 here today.  Thinking about our neighbors on the east coast and their Debbie situation. Been there. I'm so sorry. Summer's just heating up here. More storms brewing. Our biggest hits are usually in September. Teachers going back to school tomorrow, and kids next week. The kids will be wishing for a hurricane, the rest of us not so much. Turn around and don't drown. Stay safe, cool and dry.",16,positive,0.7424170970916748
"This time it probably shouldn‚Äôt accept just the H, because if you put in just the H, there are no minute letters‚Ä¶.",9,negative,0.6035207509994507
"I was just thinking to myself, it‚Äôs been a while since we had a rebus‚Ä¶ and there it was! This was a good one, too: not too hard to catch on to, and fun to hunt down once you did. 

For me, the problems were with some of the obscure answers. COATI? Never heard of one, which is why I had ‚Äúkoala‚Äù there until I finally realized SCADS isn‚Äôt spelled with a ‚Äúk‚Äù. AETNA also hung me up for a long time, as I thought the zero preceder was ‚Äúneg ‚Äú. 

I think this puzzle was a nice companion to yesterday‚Äôs, with its playful nod to the quirks of the English language. The HANDs may be minute, but the experience was grand!",21,positive,0.9451780319213867
Does anyone know how I can write in the ‚ÄúHAND‚Äù parts on the app so I don‚Äôt have to use the reveal square option? Puzzles like this always make me lose my streaks haha,1,negative,0.5070974826812744

Is the clue for 62A correct?,1,neutral,0.9188105463981628
21A reminds me of an instagram reel i saw of a mother asking her teenage daughter why she had an online receipt for HANDY NASTY,7,negative,0.8727075457572937
"From a word I'd not even encountered a month ago, SCADS is fast becoming as much of an automatic fill-in as OBOE and EPEE.",7,neutral,0.5934134721755981
"Super enjoyable.
The penny dropped early in my second pass, with the alliterative drink.
Here‚Äôs mud in your eye Mr. Youngs this was great.",8,positive,0.9622162580490112
"Somewhat disappointed that 
the minute HANDs didn't turn 
into minute üñês when the puzzle 
was solved.

Cue the Doobie Brothers, emus.",16,negative,0.7213571667671204
"What a delight to work this puzzle.  With [Bad way to get caught] the theme seemed to be almost HANDed to me, and from then on it was just the fun of all the clues.  My HAND'S UP for rating this my HANDs-down favorite crossword in many a day, no JOKE.

Thank you, Christopher Youngs.  COTTA give you credit for a beautiful construction.",15,positive,0.9793705940246582
"Just when I think I have a HANDle on Thursdays‚Ä¶

Well constructed, I‚Äôm more annoyed that I kept thinking ‚Äúit‚Äôs HAN DYNASTY‚Äù and then only put in DYNASTY because, you know, that fit. 

I even solved the revealer - MINUTE HAND. And I thought: ‚Äúgee where am I gonna get HANDS in here because I‚Äôm not seeing that‚Ä¶‚Äù I got to CHANDELIER, and when well ‚Äúsconce‚Äù doesn‚Äôt fit there. I knew HANDSUP is the response, did I take the bait? Oh no sirreee.   I even ignored the early REDHANDED, even though the answer kept glaring at me as the only possible answer. 

I play in the MURK - new word - yay? It‚Äôs the end of the day? Will be an ETERNE before I come to terms with solving for REBI?

I think the ROOT CAUSES of my issues is I still can‚Äôt spot a rebus, even though my brain now sees the answer right in front of me. 

Tune in next week for the next installment of ‚ÄúIs it Thursday?‚Äù Starring your host, me.",15,negative,0.5272430181503296
"The solution for 36A brought this swell tune right up to the front of my mind. And I'm happier for it!

"I came pretty close in the ‚Äúguess the revealer‚Äù game - I was thinking it would be ‚Äúinvisible hand‚Äù and Adam Smith might show up,

But no, that would be a puzzle in which the HANDs were actually not seen at all! I imagine that one might cause some puzzlers to crasH AND burn.

But this one, with the tiny hands, was just fresH AND fun.",33,neutral,0.5744501948356628
"I give this one a big HAND for all the minute HANDs it contains.  A well constructed, but ultimately gentle rebus is always welcome.",28,positive,0.8783730864524841
"At first I was annoyed that the revealer wasn't littleHAND because doing this on my phone, the rebus words are in fact quite little. Then I realized that they could be considered minute as well, so I guess I'll let it slide.",7,negative,0.6708394885063171
"I usually struggle with Thursdays especially rebuses. They don‚Äôt make sense to me, I never know where they go. But I was just jumping around trying to fill in easys for me knowing scotch and soda and easier said than done but not getting where the rebus was until I got red(hand)ed down and Han Dynasty across and had my Aha(nd) moment and was able to go back and fill in with the rebus correctly. Finally got a rebus with no frustration",27,negative,0.6631696224212646
"Pretty easy.  Got the theme almost immediately, long before the ""revealer"" area.

Return of the Rebus!

( Still not a fan.  :) )

It was... fine.  I'm curious as to whether others are finding it too easy for Thursday, or if perhaps I'm actually getting better at this.",13,positive,0.8361753225326538

"I feel stupid revealing this, but I dread most Thursday puzzles.  Most of them make me feel stupid. Not this one. Once I got the hang of it, it was fun searching out the places where the rebus fit. Thank you, Mr. Youngs. Let's see more of your work.",38,positive,0.5548481941223145
"I love a certain 5 letter word that a ton of people seem to hate on Thursdays.  I‚Äôm no expert solver, but this was extremely mild even if you don‚Äôt like Thursday shenanigans.",68,positive,0.6785902380943298
"Interesting to have both a Britishism (chestnuts) and an American-centric clue (AETNA).
