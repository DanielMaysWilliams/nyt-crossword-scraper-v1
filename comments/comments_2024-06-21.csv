"Thanks to the Friday Easy Mode option‚Ä¶

The regular mode Friday puzzle 51D clue  of ‚ÄúSound in stacks‚Äù is much better, because even if non-librarian crosswordlers don't know it, at least librarian crossword players can appreciate that any shushing in the library will be done by patrons, which ‚Äúsound in stacks‚Äù would describe.",2,positive,0.7893742322921753

"COSA NOSTRA = ""Our thing"".  Somehow, I've always known that about the Mafia, even though I don't know anything else.  Though I was an editor at the Literary Guild during the heyday of Mafia-themed books by the likes of Puzo, Talese and Pileggi, I somehow managed to miss them all.  Missed all the Mafia flicks, too.  No, I have never even seen Godfather 1.  

Because their ""thing"" is not my thing. I don't find them colorful; I don't find them remotely interesting. I don't care about their weddings and I don't care about their funerals. I don't care if they're good fathers or lousy fathers.  ""If you'll just leave me alone,"" I say to the Mafia, ""then I'll leave you alone.  Go swim with the fishes, for all I care.""

So 1A went in promptly.  Making the puzzle seem quite easy for a Friday.

I'm going to add SLIME TRAIL to the Mafia in my list of things I don't ever want to think about.  I'm not sure what a SLIME TRAIL is, exactly, but I know it doesn't pass my ""Breakfast Test"".  It may be as un-breakfast-y an answer as I have ever seen in the NYTXW.

But the puzzle today certainly didn't lack for colorful fill.  MANSPLAINS; SOB STORY (very nicely clued); BOOTY CALLS; ALIEN RACE; THIS IS NOT A DRILL.

Boy, there are a lot of things in the English language that ""blue"" can mean! Besides just reflecting light with a wavelength between 445-500nm, that is.

It can mean ""sad,"" and has done so since the 15th c.: it was usually one's heart or tears that were that color, although one's misfortune might go so far as to affect the color of the sun itself.  

It can be aristocratic (""blue-blooded""). It can be puritanical (""blue-stockings,"" ""blue laws.""), or conversely, prurient (""blue movies."")

It can have political leanings, either conservative, over where they wear nappies; or progressive, here in Our Great Be-diapered Country. But beware--if you go too blue, you might be labeled a Red. Go figure.

And of course, here in Michigan, it means that your Saturdays are spent in Ann Arbor, and not East Lansing.

"@Deb Amlen, point well taken. Lets just say the puzzle would have been even *more* fun if I had had to tussle with it a but longer.  :)

Now with that out of the way, I loved seeing MANSPLAINS in the puzzle. In my experience it's more often explanations by someone who actually doesn't even know what he's talking about, but the given definition fits too.",6,positive,0.9344822764396667
"Here late to balance out the ""too easy for a Friday"" comments. This one was hard for me.  Harder than Thursday's.  I'm not complaining.  I did whine to the dogs a bit. They had nothing to offer when I wailed ""slime trail, what the..."" except a head tilt and a request for a treat.  I left and came back, then was able to get in the groove.  You are so right Deb, they are fun even when hard.
Thanks NYT games.",21,negative,0.6317060589790344

"I found this to be a mix. Some entries came easily, others took a while to develop. And I think that's typical for any day's puzzle. We each have subjects we know well, and there are times we find a puzzle that we can solve easily.

Today's puzzle was quite varied, and had a few clues that I initially misinterpreted. Which then affected crossing words, and I had to go back and take a few more looks to correct the errors and that ended up putting me back on course to finish.

It was a good struggle, not helped by the fact that it was late and I'd spent a few hours walking around a Disney park before diving into the puzzle.

Nice one, Billy, and thanks.",9,positive,0.5543724298477173
"I almost gave up on this one‚Äî but persisted, and ended up solving in considerably below my average time. That is always  extremely satisfying! Not sure why it seemed so daunting at first stab‚Ä¶ after my initial run through, the grid was mostly empty, and I was not all too confident about what I did have entered. This is why I encourage folks who are inclined to look up answers to hold off for a bit; once the crosses start falling, those ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù entries begin to fill themselves in!",15,positive,0.89371657371521
"@Deb Amien

Thanks for the attempt to curtail all the tedious posts about difficulty.

Too bad it won't work.

Makes me wonder if we've always been such a combination of whiners and egoists, or if comment boards brings that out in us.",41,negative,0.7956726551055908
"Started slow, but ended fast. Easy, breezy Friday.",9,positive,0.9357779026031494
"Fridays and Saturdays are often approached with ABJECT terror, but this was fun.  When I made the connection between Sign of sluggishness and SLIME TRAIL, it was a lol moment.
Thank you, Billy.",30,positive,0.8955146670341492
"This was at first terrifying, but as the pieces of the puzzle started to fall into place, it turned out to be terrific.

What a magic carpet ride! ‚Äìfrom an uh-oh near-empty grid to proud ahas, figuring out the magnificent clueing.

It was hard, but it got done, and the sense of satisfaction is worth its weight in gold.

Thank you, Mr. Bratton!
My brain is fried, but my heart and mind are fulfilled. :-)",49,positive,0.9696367979049683
"Compared to yesterday (tough but fair, one of my favourites) this just felt a bit... underwhelming? I'm not saying it was bad - some lovely clues (BOOTY CALL, SLIME TRAIL, AVALANCHES were all fun solves) but it just wasn't quite the level that I'd like to see for a Friday. I will say [Scrap] as BIT got me stuck for quite a while, since I had it as BIN instead (assuming 'scrap' as in 'to throw away', rather than 'a small thing').",7,negative,0.6623008847236633

"A lot of too easy comments, while yesterday's people complained it was too hard. I found it reversed. Mileage definitely varies. I was pretty proud of guessing BOOTYCALLS on first blush. Was down to ONLA_E/_I_/_R_R/DO_S after about 16 minutes. Took me a few more minutes to resolve that. Streak up to 12 days",10,neutral,0.5235464572906494
"Beautiful puzzle. Not difficult, just full of subtle clues that made you think and worked together in clever ways.  Fun to work, satisfying to solve.

Thank you, Billy Bratton. My vote for an OSCAR BID.",18,positive,0.9754003882408142
"Really too easy for a Friday.  Not challenging, although it was a little fun I guess.

And I see the Wordplay column is trying to head off any such criticism with a half-hearted"" both sides will represent"" Goldilocks argument.

That's just false.  At this writing ALL the observations below are saying the same thing. Not a Friday level puzzle.

It's okay.  Sometimes puzzles are simply easy.  Let's not pretend it's entirely subjective...",7,negative,0.7471622228622437

Wow was that easy. Right around my average Weds solve time.,4,positive,0.9446011781692505
"A fun Friday. The ER at the end of 37 Across [It erupts from time to time] led me to fill in tEmpER with certainty, causing a jam up in the southwest. But once BOOTY CALLS demanded a Y the correct answer of GEYSER became apparent and the quadrant fell into place. 

Last to be corrected was OPT instead of OuT.",18,positive,0.524159848690033
"Fantastic puzzle.  Lots of wit and aha moments, starting with the very first clue.",18,positive,0.9862550497055054
"I really enjoyed this one. It felt challenging without being brain-busting. Though to be fair, I do enjoy a good brain-bust. For me, my favorite part was reaching deep into my brain to remember that female mice are called DOES. I'm pretty sure I learned that from a crossword in the first place!",37,positive,0.9738911986351013
"I'm of the 'pretty easy for a Friday' school of thought.  As a Brit  5D 'NAPPIES' came easily, but it is worth noting that 'nappy' is always disallowed in the Spelling Bee: I can only assume because in some contexts there is a racist meaning.  Some excellent clues.  I liked 22A and I had no idea that Malta has a Popeye theme park (why??).",11,positive,0.554312527179718
"I WAS on Billy Bratton's wavelength! The triple stacks fell before my mighty pen (well...keyboard). A few hiccups--ARIA before SOLO, ROOM before DOOR, and [Blue yarn?] sent me down a rabbit hole considering 50 Shades, etc., but all in all, a very satisfying Friday.",7,positive,0.8897470235824585
"55A - can someone explain this one to me? I thought retweets were changed to reposts with the X rebrand.

Or am I completely misinterpreting this clue and answer?",5,neutral,0.8354485630989075

I think this puzzle should have

"Deb asks:
Were you on Billy Bratton‚Äôs wavelength?

Apparently, Deb. 

For me,
this was more
HOLES IN ONE

SLIME TRAIL. 

I'll keep this short to avoid 16A.



Our thing indeed.",12,neutral,0.7995490431785583
