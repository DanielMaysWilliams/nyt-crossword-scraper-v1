• Providing shine amidst the profusion of SETS are the lovely PESKY, TIPPYTOES, SPEWED, and SNOOT.

Timely puzzle too, since many people (including me) have commented here lately thinking somewhat errantly that you couldn't have the same word appear twice in one puzzle. I guess none of us asked if 14 could appear...

Had a small kerfuffle by having EXpel before EXILE and muG before KEG but nothing that didn't undo itself in short order. 

Cute and fun!",12,neutral,0.6169176697731018
"Quite a fun theme today! When the second 'set' came up I was quite puzzled, then had quite the relief when i found the third, and fourth 'set'. Quite the beginner solver here, so it was refreshing to have a puzzle i could do without google :)

Also quite nice that ALL three letter words in the grid are set, and not just a select few. Great puzzle today!",48,positive,0.9753510355949402
Nice theme and well constructed but I didn't really have fun solving it. For me it didn't flow and that's where I get my word enjoyment.,4,negative,0.8508031964302063
"The 2023 New Year’s Eve puzzle (It’s Going Down) had 5 entries depicting a BALL drop. 

But I’m sure no one will be surprised to learn that this puzzle did, in fact, SET a record for the most repeats with 14. 

Congratulations, Kareem.

"Hey, this SET of all SETS was fun! When I got to the second SET I briefly wondered if I was wrong, but then by the third I was all SET! and ready to SET down the remaining ones in the grid.

Complaints about this puzzle = empty SET.",69,positive,0.9185721278190613
"Had to consult the Wordplay to figure out DUST MOP and TSOS. In where I'm from, we just call General Tso's chicken, orange or sweet and sour chicken.",4,neutral,0.8281155824661255
A very cute way to break the rules! (or use the exceptions). I especially liked the symmetry of the theme answers.,24,positive,0.9694284796714783
"Despite the assertion in the write-up that this gimmick was used on a Monday because it would have been too easy for any other day, I thought that this was one of the hardest Mondays I've seen as far as I can remember.

Not that I got severely stuck, but I couldn't just fly from answer to answer filling things as fast as I could read them.  After I got to the second SET (that of the tennis match), I realized that there were going to be repeated words, but didn't yet know that the word was always going to be SET, or that every three-letter word was going to be part of the theme.

I finished a little over a minute above my average, and I didn't have any distractions to blame.  For me, that's a significant overage.

It didn't help that I started with AROSE for STOOD (1D).  I also had EXPEL for EXILE and CELTIC for FEUDAL.  But in the end, everything was SET in its correct place.",25,negative,0.5803908705711365

"Very cool!  I still remember when learning how to use a dictionary in elementary school in the late 70s, our lovely librarian, Mrs. Silverberg, had us look up ""run"", telling us that IT had the most definitions of any word.
By the time I got to that clue, I knew that wasn't the right answer, but it did make me think of her while doing this!",30,positive,0.9560884237289429
"Cute theme. I thought there was some kind of unwritten rule against using the same answer twice in the same grid. Once I saw SET come up a second time, I figured one was wrong. By the third time I realized it had to be a theme, confirmed by the last across clue. 5 minutes flat, no mistakes. About average",9,neutral,0.5899121761322021
"I was all set to say this was too tricky for a Monday...

Then I figured I should just set my phone down and rest a set.",26,neutral,0.5999371409416199
