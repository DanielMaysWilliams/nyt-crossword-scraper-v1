"Re CRAN, I do recall this term being used by a Royal Marine (original and best) to talk about food - as in 'get some cran in you', 'time for cran' etc. This will have been in 1994 or thereabouts. As such, it is a noun, but one that denotes food in general. So you cannot talk of a CRAN, but you can talk of CRAN in general, especially of you are a Bootie. .",1,neutral,0.8306412696838379

"Another fun one!

At first I thought the theme was diva powerhouse songs-- Enough is Enough by Donna Summer & Barbra Streisand, Sorry Not Sorry by Demi Lovato... and I was expecting Piece By Piece from Kelly Clarkson.

Then I realized the theme was much simpler and has nothing to do with my Spotify playlist! Either way, well done and thank you for a great puzzle :)",13,positive,0.6961529850959778

Did not know alit - of course it was crossed with a proper noun. Would of edited that section but otherwise liked. Solid theme.,3,neutral,0.48160862922668457
"Did anyone else have BANner for ""impressively done"" before BANGUP?  Because it's Monday, I wrote it in in dark ink once I had BAN -- without checking any more crosses -- and then almost immediately had to change it.

Other than that, smooth sailing.  All the phrases are ones I've both heard and said myself, with one exception.

SORRY NOT SORRY sounds like rubbing salt in the wound to me.  Not only sarcastic, but gratuitous and deliberately unpleasant.  Here's a quiz for the blog:  Can anyone think of both a situation and a person to whom saying those words would be appropriate.  Be sure to include that person's relationship to you, if any. I actually can't think of a single instance where I might want to say such a thing.",6,neutral,0.7424745559692383
"For a brief spell, I had AYE AYE at 67A, delighted that it echoed the theme.....but then I had to revise it, so....lost opportunity, perhaps.
I see Cain got a couple of mentions; is he running for something?  

Maybe we can spice up Monday (the Day of Fewest Comments) by arguing about whether ""Pow!"" Is an accurate clue for BAM!  
I say it falls short, as 'Pow' hints at a slightly hollow report, while BAM implies a sound that is flat and perhaps lacking a echo.

"Although I'm a lifelong 7-day print subscriber, I currently solve the crosswords on my computer. 

Yesterday, Sunday, and several other days during this year, a perfectly correct solve failed to draw the customary congratulatory fanfare from the Times.

Using the key [I know, I know!], I checked my answers down and across TWICE each to no avail. 

Only by clearing the whole grid and refilling it could I get credit for solving.

Either the Times' computer is imperfect or I am. I think it's them.

"Second day in a row with a non-standard-sized grid, today at 16 x 14 versus the usual 15 x 15, a total today 224 squares compared with the usual 225.

One of my treasured crossword rituals is to glance over the finished grid and see what serendipities pop out.  Today what popped out were five double E‚Äôs, the PuzzPair¬© of EVOLVE and LITTLE BY LITTLE, and the lovely board game cross of SORRY and RISK.  Also, to go with EDEN, there‚Äôs alEVE, EVEnt, nEVEr say nEVEr, and wannabe EVA.

I liked the cute theme, showcasing those sing-song phrases.  And even though I prefer to sip rather than gulp my puzzles, I loved the feeling of zipping through this.  Thank you, Jeffrey!",23,neutral,0.6672248840332031

"Fun puzzle and a pretty smooth solve. Not a record time for me, but well below my Monday average. And... a 14 x 16 grid. Can't remember the last time I saw that - can't help but wonder how common that might be; I probably don't notice it that often.

Pardon me if the question has already been answered, but at least one ‚Äúcompetitive feature‚Äù is in the pop-up that you get when you finish the puzzle. 

With Competitive Features on, the pop-up tells you the time it took to solve the puzzle, how long your solving streak is, and how your solving time relates to your average time for that day.

"When it comes to crossword puzzles, ENOUGH IS never ENOUGH!

This was a fast and fun one, during which I had one eye on the women's gymnastics. If I hadn't, I probably would have had a personal best today. 

I'm not a big Olympics person but I love women's gymnastics! They're so amazing! So incredibly skilled and graceful. I mean, I bump into almost every door I meet... My life is constantly Tommy Boy-esque, ""Oh, that's gonna leave a mark!"" There was a time in the last year so, when I stumbled getting out of bed in the morning and bumped my head on the wall and sported a lovely bruise on my forehead for a couple weeks! Needless to say, I CAN'T EVEN believe how incredible they are and how effortless they make it look.

SORRY NOT SORRY for my digression there...  Anyhow, a fun puzzle, in which I filled out almost the entire grid in one full round of a crosses and downs. The only downside to that was that I didn't notice that my downs in the bottom middle didn't work out. I'd put AYE aye on the first go round, so no happy music, but easily fixed once I actually looked at it.

And once again, if you're not good at geography, I'll give a plug for playing a geography game. The one I do is just simply called World Geography and it has helped my crossword puzzling so much! Two years ago, I would not have known OMANIS. I say that with no pride but at least I started trying to get better at it and then when I got into puzzles, realized how much it helped!

"I was sorry-not-sorry to tear myself away from the Olympics to do this puzzle, but was astonished that so many of the words in this grid echoed what was happening in Paris! As you know, the TriOkraThon was introduced at Rio in 2016. Athletes from around the world competed in the three-part event (eating okra, obstacle course covered in okra, swimming in okra). Americans, from the Ozarks to NYC,  have taken to the sport of okra to such an extent that in just a few years the pickleball courts have been largely abandoned for the okra pits (regulation size 167 x 82' pools of stewed okra, 12.5"" deep, with ladders, slides, flues, barbed wire, slabs of concrete, hidden panels, etc.) where you'll find legions of okrathletes of all ages, drenched in okra, in friendly but serious competition. 

So far in Paris we're just in the eating stage. The Omanis took the early lead, using huge discs of pita to scoop up vast quantities of the gooey mass. The crowd let out a gasp when the Italians, who had prepared a huge cauldron of a warm, bubbling, greenish-brown okra ragu, couldn't finish. ""After a certain point, I told myself 'enough is enough,'"" said the captain, ""and my teammates felt the same."" He made a hasty escape, heading for the bathroom.

But it was the French, with their grand gruyere & okra omelet, who won the day. Little by little, they ate the 21-metre omelet. What of the Americans? They're up next, and even after those resounding defeats in Rio & Tokyo, never say never!",28,neutral,0.5212018489837646

"Recently, I‚Äôve been diving into the seemingly endless crosswords of the archive, the puzzles a perfect mix of old and new, as well as giving me more of a challenge.  
       I‚Äôve noticed that the Mondays hardly ever have a revealer, such as one I completed the other day: Six theme entries that all end in ‚ÄòAND‚Äô (ampersand, secondhand, etc.). 
       While Mondays are supposed to be easy, I loved the aspect of figuring out a simple theme for yourself (although revealers are never a bad thing), because if you try to solve too fast, you might overlook the theme altogether. Today‚Äôs crossword reminded me of the joy I felt while doing older puzzles like that, as well as having the clues being simple in a similar fashion to the older puzzles throughout to compliment.
