I wonder if there is a class of words that are anti-onomatopoeias, words that sound like the opposite of their meanings. I'll nominate three words for this logo-phylum:

CORUSCATE / CORUSCATING
True meaning: flash, gleam, sparkle
Sounds like: To harshly remove the surface layer of paint or finish with acids, scraping or sandpaper.
Use in a sentence: ""The teacher angrily coruscated John Ezra for getting so many math problems wrong."" ""After the sandstorm, many of the buildings in Enid had a coruscated look."" 

CREPUSCULE
True meaning: twilight
Sounds like: dried booger or morsels of dried food stuck to plates or bowls.
Use in a sentence: ""He blew his nose and stared at the crepuscules in his handkerchief."" ""The morning after Thanksgiving, we cleaned all the plates of their crepuscules of stuffing, sweet potatoes and turkey.""

ABBATOIR
True meaning: a slaughterhouse
Sounds like: a romantic woodland cabin usually situated near a stream; a small room, sometimes found on the highest floor, set aside for reflection, repose or romantic trysts.
Use in a sentence: ""For their honeymoon they stayed in a lovely cedar abbatoir deep in the Catskills."" ""Juliet looked down from the window of her abbatoir to see Romeo serenading her from the courtyard.""",43,neutral,0.5681953430175781

Wind (FLOAT ON AIR, STUNT FLIER)
Water (SURFER, REEFING, OCEAN MAP)

Still searching for Fire.  But nice to see that Jem got GEM into the puzzle.  A fine puzzle, which had it run in September would have caused me to link to Earth, Wind & Fire‚Äôs ‚ÄúSeptember,‚Äù but since it‚Äôs now December(!), how about ‚ÄúShining Star‚Äù:

"CLM‚Äôs VOICEOVER upon reaching ‚Äúyoungest White House resident‚Ä¶‚Äù:

‚ÄúStarts with S? ALL TOO EASY, BUNNY SLOPE! It has to be SOCKS THE CAT!‚Äù

Well, you know how much fun I have with a good wrong answer.",27,neutral,0.6091648936271667
"A very slow start to solving this one, with very little filled in at first, and then suddenly it was done. I'm always surprised when that happens.

With the definition given for LOA, I had to look up KEA to see what it means: ""cross"" according to Google Translate.",10,negative,0.6009021997451782
"First commenter?
I thought the puzzle was just about right, some tricky spots but overall challenging and fun
My only nit is I‚Äôm tired of the constant Obama references, OBAMA OBAMAERA SASHA etc. That‚Äôs not a political commentary it‚Äôs just repetitive. I get there‚Äôs all the useful vowels and such but still enough is enough.
On the plus side kudos for a very fresh clue for ATM!",0,positive,0.596797525882721
"An odd thing happened as I was finishing up this one.  I was down to 18A, and the clue above the grid was ""Coruscate"", a word I'd never seen before.  The clue in the list to the right was ""Blink"".

It must have been discovered rather quickly, because when I opened the puzzle again to verify which clue was in which position, both of them now read ""Coruscate"".

I'm solving on a desktop using Chrome, if that matters.",4,neutral,0.8502259254455566
