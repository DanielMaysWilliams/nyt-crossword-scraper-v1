It's also incredibly hot and humid -- and apparently dust from the Sahara is infiltrating our little island but I haven't looked into it much yet.

That said, I really enjoyed it and worked it all out without any help or lookups! (Huzzah!!!) It's just a good thing time doesn't matter much to me because the clock looks more like my earliest days right now!  

ERG had me flummoxed both when I thought Cabal was gaNG and then when I got RING and didn't believe it. Kinda thought I'd get the ""Something is off"" message but I didn't. Glad Deb explained that in the article! 

Also, do people use INKS for Signs sometimes? As in their signature? I haven't heard that one before so I was a bit flummoxed there too, but I guess that makes sense. I, personally, prefer to put my ole Herbie Hancock on documents.... but I'm happy to do it in INK! üòâ

Oh, and Deb, Nixon wasn't outstanding for the number of vetoes (FDR is still the champ with 635!); I think the clue just means that as president (remember when we couldn't imagine anyone worse?) a veto was one way he was able to say no. Any other president would have fit as a clue.

"Squabble about squab for all I care (squab is pigeon on a dish, so move along, nothing to see here!) but my beef is with rims being impediments to dunking. Lids are impediments.

Everything -- all of creation, all life -- is about rims. Not only is there no dunking without rims, there's no us, there's no anything. 

Ode to Rims

Without rims, you'd be walking on raw eggs,
and smell pretty beery from all the rimless mugs, 
your pointillist dots and dabs will be plenty banal
for painting a rimless gondola in a rimless canal.
Hey! Don't fall into that rimless Oahu volcano!
A rimless bathtub? That's just dumb and inane-oh. 
My creel has no rim, my fish all fell into Loch Ness,
which, rimless, left Firth after Firth quite a mess.
Ian's Irish coffee spilled over his legs,
Highland malts everywhere gushed from rimless kegs. 
But WITH rims we're all safe and sound in this here corral,
which should improve Doc Holiday's and Wyatt's morale.
Don't worry about it if you slosh some of your wine,
but your next DWI will have a steep fine.
