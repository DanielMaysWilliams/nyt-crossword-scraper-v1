That was about noon, It was a long posting, not a short one, and it was my first posting of the day. Over eight hours ago now, and still not showing up. And it was not your typical posting that gets snagged by the EMUs.

"A quick perusal tells me many found this an easy puzzle. Not surprisingly, 'twasnt easy for me. However, though it took me a little over my Saturday average, I didn't use a single lookup or a puzzle check, which I often need on Saturdays! So I guess my experience perhaps supports it being easier, despite my long time. It was fun and I was able to complete it help-free during my MIL's nap--a win in my book!  So again I say, huzzah!  üòâ

My favorite was SALAMI for substack. I love being messed with! I also enjoyed BOO BIRDS! I've never heard it before and I thought it was awfully cute!  

The SE was definitely the hardest for me. Like many, I'd put marinara and had a few other wrong things. Nothing was working out, so finally, as I do when I reach a rather tricky section, I started singing part of the pater song from Only Murders in the Building, season 3, 

""Or, coochie-coochie-coo
What if none of it is true?
Has my inspection been too cursory?
Should I look outside this nursery?
What if none of the Pickwick triplets did it?""

When that comes to my mind, I delete all of that section. When I went back, the SR was a good giveaway and the rest filled in. 

Sidenote, I don't know how often iguana shows up here, but it doesn't seem endangered like it is for the species endemic to our little island second home.

But sinking into a Wikipedia flurry of information I didn't come looking for can be an unexpected and enriching prize.

I look forward to the puzzle every evening, and I'll admit that sometimes I'm disappointed when it's over too soon or so far over my head it's like trying to find the keys to open a double locked trunk in the dark, but they're always a welcome and distracting entertainment.

Some thoughts:

I always thought FESTIVUS was a made-up holiday invented by George Costanza's father on ""Seinfeld.""  It's a real holiday?

The History of Baseball According to Nancy:

The BASKET CATCH was invented by Willie Mays of the New York Giants.  (Don't let it be forgot that once there was a team called the New York Giants that was not a football team.)  No one had ever caught a ball in such a manner before.  Willie's most famous BASKET CATCH was off of Vic Wertz in a World Series game.   You should Google the play.

In 1957, the evil owner Horace Stoneham whisked the Giants off to San Francisco.  And no one other than Willie Mays ever made a BASKET CATCH after that.  Don't tell me that they did, because if I never saw it, it doesn't count.  After the evil Horace Stoneham took my team away from me, I stopped watching baseball entirely.  Well, I did make a brief attempt to switch my allegiance to the hapless Mets, but it was unsuccessful and very short-lived.

And that, Dear Reader, is my very brief history of the BASKET CATCH.",22,positive,0.719232439994812

Not only spotless, but gorgeous answers all around, a grid bathed in beauty: WAMPUM, FOIST, PULL STRINGS, BASKET CATCH, HIATUS, AGE OUT, PACK IT IN, GAUCHE, BOO BIRDS, ALL EARS, and WIFFLE.

"David P. Williams's 4th installment of his 13 Ways of Looking at a Blackbird series, apparently an homage to the 13-part poem by 
Wallace Stevens, does contain words related to the poem -- union, boo birds, nests -- and I've gamely made efforts to decode the first 3 installments with limited success, as have other commenters (Henry Su, Puzzlemucker and several others), but I'm getting a little tired of the game.  Maybe Williams has deployed SECRET CODES we are meant to decipher, but I feel more and more like a PATSY, trying to glean something meaningful from the clues and the fill that is likely just a chimera. 

Perhaps Mr. Williams will clue us in as to what it was all about a couple years from now when we get the 13th installment, but at this point I'm packing it in. One of the lessons of many of Stevens' more philosophical and metaphysical poems is that there's no there, there: it's only in our minds.

Fagliano's approach for the weekend is more like Wednesday/Thursday without a theme, with a little corner here or there where it hinges on a trivial cross. 

Everyone is grappling with how attuned we'd become to Shortz's style. 

I'd just be glad the NYT is soldiering on. They have archives back to the 90s. If you're breezing through these, roll back the clock a decade or two, find something you haven't done. 

Or get serious and construct a puzzle. That'll fill up your day.",34,positive,0.7783361077308655
Slowed a bit by diving instead of BASKET CATCH and marinara instead of SRIRACHA. Pretty quick otherwise. But what‚Äôs with all the ASSHATs these days??,8,negative,0.732244610786438
"Agree with most posters so far - it was an easy Saturday.  Very close to my PB, and about 70%(!) faster than my Saturday average.  There was another extraordinarily easy Saturday 6 to 12 months ago.  That and this one are true outliers.",4,positive,0.932801365852356
The first half of 10 down and 15 across. Getting a little risque!,9,neutral,0.7587605714797974
This was a fun one. It went much better for me after I benched circus catch and subbed in basket catch. Also nice to see the great East Coast Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery make an appearance.,8,positive,0.981838583946228
"Some nice clues in this puzzle. Besides, I will like any puzzle that has FESTIVUS in it.",28,positive,0.9820948243141174
"Always hate when I breeze through the puzzle and come to the comments to see that everyone else solved it at or close to their personal best. Granted, at this point, we're a self selecting audience having solved it first, but still. Two minutes off my PB, so mistakes",6,negative,0.8140723705291748
"The Kinks said it best: Let me take you on a little trip, On my supersonic rocket ship. 

So fast for a Saturday!",5,positive,0.8727429509162903
What did we do to deserve two ASSHATs in one week?,82,negative,0.948879599571228
"I am finding that as a long-time solver, probably close to 2 decades on-and-off, my times are extremely consistent.  I'm sure there are others like me out there with a massive, massive data set. Interestingly too, my average times and PB times for each weekday show a startling consistency - both are almost linear from Monday to Saturday. 

So I am not blowing my own horn when I say Joel's calibration seems a bit off. Friday PB yesterday by over a minute. New PB for Saturday today.  A third PB for a Wed a few weeks ago. 

I am indeed enjoying the new Fagliano regime and I am finding some of the clues and themes are fresh, which is great. But my take is that the difficulty level needs an end-of-week tweak. I am definitely not getting smarter - so says my wife.",34,positive,0.8447715640068054
"Less than half my average time. I mean, cute little puzzle, but somehow I expect a bit more for a Saturday...",9,neutral,0.454027384519577
"This puzzle took me about 2 minutes less than the Friday puzzle, and came in at about 53% of my Saturday average.

I'd say that whether it took you ten minutes or an hour, this is going to be a relatively easy puzzle for most of you.",9,positive,0.8115599155426025
