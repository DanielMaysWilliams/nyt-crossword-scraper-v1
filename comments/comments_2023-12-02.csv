"Really enjoyed this puzzle.  I was a bit surprised to read how much difficulty this gave to many.

NE caused me all my time, as I had ECOblAMING crossing settle (instead of SOOTHE, for the clue ""calm.""

I would agree some of these portmanteaus try a little to hard, but it's not like Royce made them up.  It was fun trying to figure them out.

CAREERPATH was amazing.

I flew through this one, but as we all know, sometimes it's the 'unique' letter cross that makes things easier.  I know that didn't make sense.  Example:  RAPGOD was a gimme for me.  And then for ""annual New Year's Day event,"" I have a 10 letter entry, but a P (from RapGod) in the fifth cell.  So it is a gimme (for me).  If it was the O that crossed, then no chance.  This happened to me throughout the puzzle. I can't recall now, but I had two crosses that got me UNCONSCIOUS.BIAS.   So that's not 'skill' per se.  It 'luck.'

I was done 3/4 of the puzzle in under 15 minutes.  But again, that NE took me longer than the rest of the puzzle.

"One of the hardest puzzles I've ever done, requiring one cheat on RAP GOD, and leaving me thinking I'd need a lot more.  And speaking of that...

Who knew that putting in LOTS instead of GOBS (20A) for ""a whole bunch"" would leave me sobbing with so many SOBS?  LOTS made everything in the NW go AWRY -- especially because HERBS, so easy once you have the H and the B, was now ungettable with an H and a T.

HALS and SOBS were the only things I had in the whole NW-ish.  I wouldn't cheat on RAP GOD until much later.  (You all know how much I hate to cheat.)

This was a complete ""keep the faith"" puzzle, as I didn't think I'd ever solve anything in the NW.  Or the SW, for that matter.  My entry point was DLINE to DO NO HARM -- the latter being quite an interesting clue.

But my favorite clue/answer -- one of the best of all time, I'd argue -- was ""covert influencer"".  I was expecting some snotty  know-nothing teenager on TikTok with 106,000 completely undeserved ""followers"".  Instead I got UNCONSCIOUS BIAS.  How true, how true -- and I never saw it coming.

Today's questions.  What on earth is a LUD?  And what on earth is SPARENTING?

I'm not fond of either A MUST or A BIT.  While I know that ""a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds"", puzzle answers almost never include the indefinite article and so this is quite unfair to the solver in what already is a bear of a puzzle.

Come on, people, this is supposed to be hard.  Most people come into a Saturday expecting this, and expecting to learn new things.  Complaining that it's hard?  Heck, it's a learning opportunity.

How can you make it less difficult?  Experience is key.  I am convinced that you develop a certain crossword intuition at some point which helps you a lot (i.e. by getting immediately that ""Grand"" clues THOU or that the New Year's event is practically guaranteed to be ROSE PARADE) and very occasionally, leads you astray (NENES would have been clued with geese).  You become familiar with SMAZE and can easily figure out SHARENTING, even if you've never seen it before.  You hold off on putting ""Big"" BANG because it could be something else...and is.

re CAREER PATH: just a couple days ago, we had a discussion of the differences between Careen, Career, and Carom.

The notion of a metaphorical anything moving around, or across, a metaphorical path arose quite quickly; but Career didn't get its sense of ""Life profession"" until the early 19th c. And since most race-tracks are elliptical, none of us should be surprised when we end our Working Days once again as stock-boys or -girls, behind the counter of a fast food restaurant, or greeting cutomers at a mega-store.

"I’ve relished the last handful of Saturdays – tough but fair – IMO, the best stretch of Saturdays in quite a while, and I was hoping today’s offering would continue this trend.  It did. 

There were sweet joys:
• Lovely answers: WHAT A BEAST, UNCONSCIOUS BIAS, TAPENADE, EASY DOES IT, BAOBABS, HEY NOW, TAKE THE BAIT.  Four of these are NYT answer debuts, adding the sheen of freshness to their beauty.  Meanwhile, junk be gone!
• Wordplay throughout in the cluing.  To borrow from the clue for HINT, it felt to me like the entire puzzle was made with a wink.  

And sweet resistance to work through:
• Riddles to be cracked, i.e., [What to do?], [Work in progress?], [It’s there by default}. 
• Vagueness to teach patience, i.e. [Still], [Calm].

And thus, this was a Return-To solve for much of the time, where I would get stuck in an area, go elsewhere, then come back later and with a magnificent ping, see an answer, fill in more, then get stuck again, rinse and repeat.  All the while being enriched by the lovely entries and wordplay.

Alas, I find that when guests ask me for a martini, they, more often than not, expect a vodka based libation. My stubbornness led to complication because I could not come up with NENES either, which I thought would be the appropriate answer only if the clue was Hawaiian geese.  Like some others, I thought I’d have to put the puzzle aside, but then I hit on REFERS and my mistakes became clear. This was a satisfying solve in the end.",17,negative,0.7485601902008057
"Why was that NW so tough for me?  Partly because I had WHAT A BEAuT (14A), YUm (19A) and tOnS (20A) and was just so sure about them.  Partly because there were so many unknowns.  I finally did a bunch of erasing and looked at it with new eyes and realized that once I got those pesky letters out of there, that I actually knew WASP,  LSD and RAP GOD.  That really opened things up and allowed me to get it done.  The rest of the puzzle wasn't a cakewalk (or a snap), but the NW was a BEAST.  Royce Ferguson is a worthy Saturday opponent, and I hope I don't have to wait another 3 years to hear from him.",9,neutral,0.46600592136383057
"Excellent puzzle. I enjoy figuring out the portmanteaux and adding them to my wordbase.

My time came in a bit over average, although my averages mean little, because I quite often use the whiteness of the NYT crossword screen to light my way through the dark house when I get up in the middle of the night, not to mention the fact that I frequently leave the crossword open on the MacBook while I get up to see what mischief the cat is into.

Enjoyable. Thanks.",10,positive,0.9022427201271057
"Completed left sections more quickly than the right, but right side had my favorites : THIGHS, ANTE, DO NO HARM, SOOTHE, HINT, TEMPO, PRESET

Got UNCONSCIOUS BIAS fairly early on, my past & present employers (specifically D&I) will be proud 😊

Enjoyed this Saturday puzzle, thank you",5,positive,0.9445411562919617
"WHAT A BEAST of a puzzle.
EASY DOES IT, I thought. 
Calm/SOOTHE...
*Tranquility.*
But with four center squares still unfilled and nothing coming to me, I remembered Depeche Mode who I got to see in concert this week. 
""Tranquility"" took me back to the lyrics of their beautiful song, one of the most  gorgeously melodic songs I've heard, ""Waiting For The Night""...

""I'm waiting for the night to fall
I know that it will save us all
When everything's dark,
 keeps us from the stark
Reality

I'm waiting for the night to fall
When everything is bearable
And there in the still, all that you feel is
Tranquility""

I stopped everything for a moment and sat here, outside, in the cold and dark, and listened to the song again.

And with *tranquility* I returned to the puzzle and it  came to me, those last four squares, the last three words.

Thank you, Royse Ferguson, for what was an exquisite experience in solving -- one of those that concurrently leaves me insecure, feeling that I don't know much, and slowly breaks open and assuages me;  maybe I do.",17,positive,0.8777436017990112
"Does the photo of one’s dog or cat for the Wordplay avatar count as SHARENTING? 

Surely it can DO NO HARM.

"I like tough puzzles, but I prefer a pretty strict adherence to the conventions I've been accustomed to for decades. They are apparently obsolescent, unfortunately. One neologism, or fashionable phrase, maybe, but two or three strikes me as overdoing it. Microdot as LSD is new to me, especially after this year's chem Nobel for quantum dots, or as the annotation remarks, for secret messages. 'Covert' generally denotes deliberate concealment, unconscious bias being the opposite of deliberate. I'm sure the criticism is cranky, but so be it; puzzles attract fastidious types, among others.",39,negative,0.5945388078689575
"Whew. Did it.

Boy howdy, this has been a humdinger of a solving week. So many clues enticed me, so many guesses repulsed me from that gold star orbit.

Heck, it's still the most fun you can have on your ownsome lonesome without raising eyebrows.

Happy weekend, and remember to call, write, or better yet, hug those folks you love!",14,positive,0.9512555599212646
"I would submit that SPARENTING and (thus) PAH are perfectly good alternatives down there in the SE.  Sparenting is probably more common in my experience to mean a (usually) grandma who takes a major role in child care and who certainly posts pix to FB etc; and PAH is defined in Wiktionary as 'Used to express distaste, disgust or outrage.' which certainly fits the definition of 53D.  I demand a recount.",7,neutral,0.6160160899162292
"WHATABEAuT was not right for the fill, but a perfect description of this puzzle.  Trickle downs economically found and acrosses that weren't exactly a ROSEPARADE, but no GOBS of SOBS if I didn't STEPON the gas and TAKETHEBAIT of some clever HINT.  (EASYDOESIT and they DONOHARM.)

You love this puzzle?  SODOI!!  

Thank you, Royce, for giving us a great grid and a crossword that was definitely not a SNOOZEFEST.",8,positive,0.40771400928497314
"Too many obscure portmanteaus for my taste. ECOSHAMING, SHARENTING, and SMAZE were all new to me. I doubt I'll ever encounter any of those three terms again outside of a crossword.",56,negative,0.7430754899978638
"I had been looking forward to the crossword all day. This was my third and last day teaching an immigration advocacy skills program on Zoom, five straight hours onscreen each afternoon. Yeesh! The Saturday puzzle would be my long-awaited break.

What fun! I had precious little in the NW -- one wrong answer -- gnat instead of WASP -- plus BAOBABS. (Merci, Monsieur Saint-Exupéry.) No problem. Just move on to another quadrant. 

In the NE, ACAI and HINT gave me the toeholds I needed. That said, a word like ECOSHAMING made me think that Mr. Ferguson might have a thing for coined terms that have more recently entered our vocabulary.

I was right, and for such fill, it can be hit or miss. As Mr. Ferguson himself notes, SHARENTING was a word he happened to come across as a new parent. Sorry, I'm way past that phase now, and I needed both ART SET and HAH to confirm the portmanteau.

Regarding the cluing of ESCAPE ROOM, ""Breakout site"" may have a disguised capital letter; there is a company called Breakout that owns and operates escape rooms around the country.

Back to the NW, it finally dawned on me that the cluing for 5D (""Boastful Eminem ..."") meant I needed a G for GOD and thus GOBS, as opposed to tOnS or lOts. That led me to HERBS, and in this fashion, that quadrant came together.

All in all, a nice workout.",24,positive,0.9154523015022278
"I had more unfilled squares for longer than I liked, and for a bit, I wondered whether I would have to set it aside until the morning. So I was surprised to see that I beat my Saturday average (by a whopping 12 seconds).

I don’t think I have heard the term ECOSHAMING, but it was fairly easy to get from the clue and a few critical letters. SHARENTING, also new to me, was a bit more difficult.

Overall, it was the kind of puzzle I like best: Challenging but ultimately solvable in a reasonable amount of time. 

Thanks, Mr. Ferguson! I hope we don’t have to wait another three years for your next puzzle.",23,positive,0.7180247902870178
"Nice chewy puzzle was a balm for my travails - WHAT A BEAST of a day.
Long train journey on my way home (not that I’m ECOSHAMING anyone, I really like the train.)

A thing went wrong, never mind what, but it was A Thing.
At one point the train car was a type of ESCAPE ROOM.  

DO NO HARM, oh train staff! Please tell us what’s going on! An ounce of info can SOOTHE a pound of frustration.

TAKE THE BAIT? Well, I’ll take your tempting offer of three buses and another train to get home.

A good quality SNOOZE FEST awaits me at the end! See ya Sunday!",24,positive,0.8469884395599365

"BEAST of a Saturday.  One of the toughest of the year for me.  And yet . . .  Why?  Nothing particularly arcane.  A lot of ambiguous clues, very few gimmes, that dang “Rice and Curry” clue and my knee-jerk ANN (same as the last time we saw it).  But given how much I struggled with this, I’m shoeracked to look back at the grid and see what is in many ways a more wide open Weintraubian Friday grid.

Great puzzle, Royce!  Sure to elicit GOBS of SOBS, like a Saturday should.",43,negative,0.5384725332260132
