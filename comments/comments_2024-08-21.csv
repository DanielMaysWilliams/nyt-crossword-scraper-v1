"CHOCK A BLOCK and SUS are both new to me! To my recollection, I've not heard of either. Now I have! Go, me!!

I like the nearness of SCRUB with RUB A DUB CLUB! Kinda wish they could have crossed. Was that the only similarity to a theme clue in the puzzle? That's the only one that popped out at me, anyhow. 

Although, now that I'm looking, I can very loosely see that NOVAK's in the kitchen with DINAH and I'm diggin' that a bit!

Fun, enjoyable, and fast! Nice for a Wednesday, which, for half of, I thought was a Tuesday.

"I hope you all don't mind a few suggestions about the app as a whole. Namely:
1) Could the Strands tile change to show that you've already solved it? Just like Connections.
2) Could you please retain my solution to Letter Boxed and show in the app how many words it took me? I always shoot for 3. Did it once in 2. An archive and a record of my stats (average # of words to solve? Shortest solve? Longest?) would be great, too. 
3) I love that you publish some crosswords early, but I dislike that the Sudokus are updated at the same time. For crosswords, you can still go to the archive to finish, but that's not the case with the Sudokus. My suggestion: create a Sudoku archive. Or stop updating them early.

I think with these changes, the app can work as an integrated whole. And BTW, nice job on integrating the Wordle Bot into the app!",5,neutral,0.6484441757202148

"Quick scan of the comments makes me think I'm in a small minority who found the puzzle wanting.  Silliness is great but a NYT puzzle theme should have a little cleverness.

This one did not.  (As far as I and the Wordplay columnist can tell.)  Just rhyme plus random word.  I do this all the time while humming around annoying my family - but I would never write it down and pass it off as a crossword.

All my own opinion of course.  But I feel the puzzle should be better than this.  (Unless of course I'm missing something of note in the construction.)

"This was definitely easier for me than the previous offerings (one of the weekend ones and Tuesday!)  

I question the 40D clue:  Sus.  What?  SUSS (a verb, meaning to winkle out or divine, as ""suss out the motive"") but I've never heard even that used as an adjective.  The whole thing is Sus, IMHO.

I misread the clue # at 22A and tried to stuff Puerto RICAN into that slot, which was a big mess.  I really need to go get these glasses adjusted (or replaced)

Had CORE before CRUX, HERE before HOME...but worst of all, I wanted something like BANGLES to start the 26A entry.  TSK.

And for FAVE and MOST EVOCATIVE ENTRY:   PUMA!  I can't see one or see or hear the word without having Tommy Smothers immediately come to mind...  (Coincidentally, my sockies say PUMA on them...so I start most days with a chuckle, which isn't a bad way to go.

One kind of interesting answer history search result today - I've run into stuff like this before. Anyway... ONEG. That's been an answer in 55 Shortz era puzzles and... once in a pre-Shortz puzzle. Did a couple of additional checks - 

ANEG? Five times in the Shortz era, never in a pre-Shortz puzzle. 

BNEG - 5 time in Shortz puzzles - never in a pre-Shortz puzzle.

Has to have been some kind of change in standards there somewhere. I might start trying to find some possible related finds later on and see what I can come up with. 

Oh, and of course a puzzle find today. I'll put that in a reply.

"With so many Rockers and Rappers in the puzzle these days it was a treat to see good old DINAH Shore in the grid.

SUS was a new one for me even after i filled it in from the crossings? Can I get a little background here?",7,positive,0.9399175643920898
"I was totally charmed by this theme.  Wordplay comes in different flavors.  Sometimes it comes from playing with meanings.  And sometimes, like today, it comes from the unalloyed joy of playing with sounds, specifically rhyming sounds. 

To riff off an old lyric -- Rappers do it, kids do it, even people making grids do it.  

My sister and I used to make up words that sounded silly, and give them wacky meanings.  We did it all the time.  It was fun.  It cracked us up.  We still do it.  It knocks us out of our serious adulthood selves.

So how could I not be charmed by RUBADUB, DINGALING and friends?  And guessing the rhyming word that followed each of the phrases in the grid?  

The kid inside me also loved learning about the game ""The Floor Is Lava"", which I had never heard of, but what fun!  

It also loved the schwa A-train of AROMA / ALMA / LAVA / SAGA / SARA / URSA / UMA / PUMA / OTRA, plus RUBA, DINGA, CHOCKA, and CHUGA.

"SUS is sketchy but SKETCHY is not sus, IMHO. Is sus a thing? I tried to suss it out but I sus it's not a thing; I also sus that I'm using it wrongly. Ok, enough of that. On to ""Unlikely thing off of which to buy haute couture"" -- rather cockeyed phrasing, but it jimmied open a memory I had suppressed in embarrassment: when I was in my twenties, I went to Paris and had a grand time, including a kiss or two (exactly how French were those kisses I can't recall), but one morning I went to the cafe and wanted a coffee to go, not usually offered by this cafe. ""Un cafe americano, pret a porter,"" I said to the barista, thinking the phrase meant ready to go (it means ""off the rack"" which is what popped this back into my brain). ""You want to WEAR your coffee, m'sieur"" said the man mockingly. He made a little show of it, balancing a cup of coffee on his shoulder and doing a small jig. He then, to the laughter of some patrons, poured the cup of coffee into a paper cup and handed it to me with a flourish. ""Here you go, ready to wear!""  And every time I slunk by the window, he'd still see me and call out, ""Pret a porter, m'sieur!"" Which, now that I'm turning it over in my mind, strikes me as not so terrible a thing, almost charming, and not at all sus.
