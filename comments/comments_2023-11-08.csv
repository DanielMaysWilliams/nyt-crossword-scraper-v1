Favorite clue/fill definitely THEDAMAGE. Loved that.  Could have benefited from tolerating fewer of the weaker entries (ORANG, NORAD, TRAPEZIST, and TYPESIZE were my least fave).

Not because it’s harder, but because there are more liberties taken with answers that after I reveal it, I don’t learn anything…..I just shake my head and can’t believe the answer. I’m fine with things I don’t know, but it feels like past tuesdays you all embrace clues and answers that to me just feel lazy and shouldn’t be accepted. Case in point today, I just did the top part and two items that no one else commented on, so you all clearly think is fine…. “Orang”? It’s orangutan, and putting “familiarly” in the clue doesn’t change the fact that orang isn’t an abbreviation thats in common usage. If I’m at a zoo I won’t hear the zookeeper say “we have three orangs”. Then ezine. I get that it’s in some dictionaries (but not in my iPhone dictionary as it is trying to autocorrect as I typed it) and maybe in 1998 someone coined that phrase… but that’s a stupid term and people don’t use it outside the crossword nerd-bubble.

I didn’t solve the actual revealer (cute!) until toward the end, but I caught on right away to the song entries and was able to skip ahead to blank territory to fill out SLEDGEHAMMER and BREAKONTHROUGH after I suspected something was going on with WRECKINGBALL. I am a diehard trivia fan, and I love all music from all eras, and I adore double meanings, and this was just the best. 

The rest of the fill was challenging enough to keep it all from flying by too quickly or feeling unsatisfying—like Sam, I also fell into the Durham trap, and that UNc to UNH correction is what saved the day. 

“Soupçon” is a new word for me and its answer could have been a natick with the also-unfamiliar-to-me phrase in 48A, but “ars” is a common enough Latin word I didn’t have to try too hard to shake it out. Glad to have learned a new French word, as I’ve been trying to teach myself French in *literally* the most passive way possible for going on 5 years (i.e. keeping my phone and all apps set to French and brute-forcing my way through every single task without fully understanding what the hell I’m doing).

"So many comments on one crossing! Again, I think the games tech crew could show what the top “final squares” were for each day’s puzzle.

When you think “how could they make such an obvious mistake?!?” you should dismiss the thought and replace it with “how else could I think about this?” It much more likely to be a productive thought.

A hot set is one that uses props that must not be mistaken for real, or real elements that must not be taken for props: breakaway furniture, glasses, bottles, weapons. Sitting on a breakaway chair ruins a take or a scene, when the chair was put there to be smashed over someone’s head. Unfortunately, the armorer for a recent movie hot set provided live ammo in a real pistol instead of the expected blanks in a prop gun and that had very serious consequences.

Here’s a stunning example of a hot set that is also a wet set: the underwater bar fight scene in “Top Secret” was the last time a film shot an entire scene underwater rather than “dry-for-wet” or cgi. Breakaway furniture, bottles, prop guns, it’s all in there. A wet hot set:

As a movie cameraman for 42 years I’d like to offer one bit of elucidation regarding the term ‘hot set’.  A hot set is one that has had shots done in it but is currently not in use for one reason or another. If, for example, half a scene has been shot on a particular set at the end of one day and the company intends to finish that scene sometime the next day the set would have signs all around marking it as a hot set, denoting that objects on that set have been established in their current positions and in the interest of preserving continuity nothing can be moved. ‘Action ready’ is correct but incomplete. ‘In progress’ would be closer.",26,positive,0.7966466546058655

"Me too with the cOTSETS and UNC.  Well Chapel Hill is almost Durham and when I had to go there for a conference 20+ years ago I flew into Raleigh-Durham.  That's my excuse and I am sticking to it.

On (IMO) safer ground, why do we call them ESCAPEES (70A)?  I understand payer/payee and employer/employee etc to distinguish between the person who does the paying and s/he who receives payment: but what is wrong with escaper?  And while I am at it, the (to me) horror sign you see in some airports - 'Standees to the right.'  Ugh.",13,neutral,0.6458203196525574

"Flew through the theme and was feeling ~good~
Then, like others, I hit the SW corner. Eventually I got through that with help from wordplay giving us HOT SETS. My last two ended up actually being ARS/NORAD as I don’t know Latin or Santa’s connections to the defense command (which btw is not a very intuitive acronym imo??) Happy solving, y’all!",3,positive,0.7617405652999878
"Mr. Hrynick, when you mentioned in your notes that you might just send crossword editors puzzles for the rest of your life, I hope that was a promise -- and one that you'll keep.

Congrats on your debut! Thank you for a breezy and enjoyable puzzle that had me humming throughout, from one song to the next.

But I did stop when I came to Phil Collins since I'm a huge fan.
Here he is with one of my favorites, ""Take Me Home"" *destroying* on drums.

"May I share an observation with all those who were caught up by the UNH/UNc issue. For an Australian, HOTSETS came as the most obvious entry. I am aware of both NC and NH as state names. A case where less local knowledge helped rather than hindered.",28,neutral,0.8158395886421204
"Somehow, I finished this below my Wednesday average with no lookups, despite being unfamiliar with a lot of the fill and some of the clues. That makes this a terrific puzzle, in my opinion. 

Words I learned tonight, in no particular order:

TYRO
soupcon
HOTSETS
ARS gratia artis
UNICODE
GEST

"As a UNC grad, I swiftly made it through the SW corner but was absolutely LIVID that the editors allowed such a major blunder to go through.

"Bartleby the scrivener read that Ikea was having a sale on “cot sets”.
When he arrived, the store music system was playing what was identified on the playlist as “Smash Hit Pachelbel’s Cannon”.
He opened up a cot set to check the assembly instructions:
“Step one: pierce film with fork” and it went on for 57 more steps, finishing with a list of places to avoid using your new cot, such as near an open flame or outdoors during flash flood conditions.
Seeing all this, Bartleby said “I would prefer not to”, and planned his next shopping trip to the sporting goods store in Durham, New Hampshire.",42,neutral,0.9126303791999817

I’m always up for a musical theme. Nicely done.

Fun puzzle!",15,negative,0.500704824924469
"A lively puzzle with some great crosshatching.  Fun from start to almost finish, buIt had to come to the column to get that set. 

Daniel Hrynick, with a  SMASHHIT like this one, wouldn't need a SLEDGEHAMMER to BREAKONTHROUGH into the puzz-construction world.  Looks like you are a brain laborer as well as a physical laborer.  Welcome to the party, and thanks for bringing us this fine puzzle.",12,positive,0.9594400525093079

"61D:  I was pretty sure UNC was incorrect since my daughter went there and it was in Chapel Hill, not Durham... but then I wondered if there could be a satellite campus in Durham, but then I realized HOTSETS made more sense than COTSETS for the movie location...and I remembered there's a Durham in NH.  My brain was firing on all cylinders!  As is says in 37D, IRULE!

And now I have the Doors hit as an earworm for the rest of the evening.",31,neutral,0.6317549347877502

"I crushed this clever, music themed puzzle, which was right up my alley. Not bragging, just trying to play on the destructive aspect of the theme.  I actually had a little trouble in the SW, because I assumed Durham was in NC, and I didn’t know UNICODE or HOTSETS.  As usual, logic and a bit of guesswork paid off and I broke on through to the other side.",9,positive,0.9351337552070618
"Fooled briefly by ""Durham sch."" -- I know there's a university in Durham, NC (but it's Duke, not UNC, which is in Chapel Hill).
