"i will admit that I'm posting this late because I was conflicted about it. Lewis, whom I hold in high regard, mentioned Dekker's quintuple pangram, which i solved and enjoyed. Lewis is known for only saying positive things, but there was a dark side to that particular story, and it's been bugging me all day. I finally found a fairly good summary of it in one place, so I'm cutting and pasting it below. Perhaps the NYTimes will delete it because they don't want to give Dekker any more attention, and that's fine. But it certainly soured me on a talented constructor.

"This was one of my favorite Saturdays, which are usually my least favorite day. Not because they tend to be the hardest but I just don't think they're as fun as tricks and themes are for me. But this one had super cute clues, some of which had me really stumped, but usually when I finally got them, they made me smile big time!

I also really liked what I think many commenters and the column have referred to as Scrabbly letters. That was surprising and fun! I didn't know before about pangrams or double pangrams, being a pretty new solver, but I think that's pretty cool!

I had a bit of a hard time getting going on it and ended up having to do two lookups early on, even after sleeping on it.  I try really hard not to do look ups but I just couldn't get anything going. Once I had those plugged in on the eastern side, I was able to work everything out eventually.

"I am not sure about the definition of the Sothern Italian word ziti. It is masculine plural meaning either betrothed men, lovers, grooms , or newly married men. Being masculine plural, it also means the betrothed male/female, the male/female lovers, the bride/groom couple or the newly married male/female couple.
The masculine singular is Zito.


The feminine singular is Zita, and feminine plural is Zite. This means a betrothed female, a female lover, a bride, or a newly married female.  There is, to my knowledge, no usage of Ziti as ""brides"". 

This word is used in the dialects of Southern Italy, and has regional usage nuances. 

In the context of pasta, the words zita and ziti refer to the tubular pasta with which we are familiar. The bride would traditionally make ""ziti"" for her spouse. But ziti, in terms of pasta or gender, does not refer to brides: for brides, the word would be zite.",5,neutral,0.8578466773033142

Odd theme: In ALL of the theme answers, every letter in the answer appeared at least twice, except for one and those un-repeated letters were highlighted (or circled). Here are two answers that were in BOTH puzzles with the un-repeated letter in parentheses: 

HIPPOC(R)ATICOATH
SH(E)SALLTHAT

 Very little came easily to me.  Which is the best kind of Saturday.  Seemed about as hip as a NYT Xword gets, which is not very, but still hipper than me.  Hope these constructors don‚Äôt get basted out (see, it rolls right off the tongue) for using their heads for slang.",15,positive,0.36282017827033997

"SUSHI PIZZA?  Blame Canada.

From Wikipedia:
Sushi pizza is a Canadian dish that originated from Toronto and a fusion of sushi and pizza often served in the Greater Toronto Area, conceptualized by Kaoru Ohsada no later than May 1993 as a Nami Japanese Seafood Restaurant chef. It uses a slightly crispy yet chewy fried rice patty as the base and is topped with a layer of sliced avocado, a layer of sliced salmon, tuna or crab meat, a drizzle of blended mayonnaise and wasabi powder and is served in wedges. Nori, pickled ginger, and roe are sometimes also served as toppings or sides.",15,neutral,0.727186381816864
"Maybe I‚Äôm just getting better at these things, but this felt like the easiest Saturday puzzle I‚Äôve done by miles! Very nice flow, plenty of misdirects but I nearly always was able to get them with no cross. Maybe the creator just has the exact same sense of humor as I do?",9,positive,0.9747477769851685
"Phew. That was a workout! The SE corner bedeviled me for the longest time, as I tried SLAW before caving to look up PONE (never heard of it) and DOLL in place of TOYS along the right side, while the clues for DONEZO and SNEEZY felt like they could have been anything.

I appreciate the current pop culture references like POKE BALL, DIAZ and DOJA (although that nickname for Tay took me way too long to sort out). The only ""never heard of 'ems"" for me this week were HEP, OLAV, and, I guess, SUSHI PIZZA.",8,positive,0.8095715045928955
Really fun clues here. Good mix of difficulty in this one too. The BARMENU clue took me for a loop!! Haha,10,positive,0.9875298738479614
"I get the complaints about too many clashing consonants but for me it was refreshing to see more currently relevant cultural entries like TSWIZZLE, VRHEADSETS, DOJA, POKEBALL, TTYL (text speak) rather than references from 50s and 60s that I have no clue about. Doubly awesome that it‚Äôs a double pangram. Kudos to the constructors!",70,positive,0.8139160871505737

"When I drink my boba, I don't use a wide straw, but I do stir it up with a TEA SWiZZLE. Great humor evident across the grid, especially so in the clues for USS, FLU and BAR MENU. Great crosses, too: the marine trio of AHI, AQUA and SPRIT crossing SUSHI; USS's bow/sprit also caught my eye, as did the BRUISING MEN piling on top of QB SACKS -- that can only lead to lots of BOO BOOS. Nor is it easy to POKE BALLS away from any of the MAVS. And these days when traveling by plane have you noticed the only way to walk down the aisles is by sidling? Or am I being a little crabby?

I tried to fit FEMINIST ICONS into the four squares for Barbie and Ken, had to settle for TOYS. Sometimes a toy is just a toy. Kind of deep, makes me REFLECT a bit. 

Double pangram -- and as Caitlin said, a fever dream for a Scrabble player  -- that's a feat sure to AMAZE even the most jaded player. 

I love lanolin! Although lately when I use it as lip balm I get a little sheepish about kissing anyone. 

Finally, today I learned that when does are in heat, their tails stand up and wave back and forth, which is called ""flagging."" I do not believe that's what was happening at Iwo Jima, however. 

Because of this puzzle and 354 million other reasons, I'll sleep well tonight. TTYL.",46,positive,0.7493361234664917

"I found this puzzle to be appropriately hard for a Saturday and had to rely on the crosses in several places. 

Case in point: I've never heard of DONEZO, nor SUSHI PIZZA. But I trusted that the latter must be a thing, which gave me the Z I needed. 

In the NW, I experienced another instance of priming. I entered STEADY GIG  and then turned to the entry right above it, 16A -- ""Going after the big bucks, say.""  I thought to myself, ""Oh, another clue about jobs."" But I needed the crosses to solve it, and even then, I stared at the answer -- IN HEAT -- and scratched my head. It was only minutes later that the light bulb came on. Good one.

I completed the grid but there was no happy music. I spent many minutes flyspecking, checking each clue/entry one by one. Finally, I spotted the bug in my grid -- I had FLy instead of FLU. 

GEE WHIZ.",34,neutral,0.6576547622680664
"I got a little caught up in the east, thinking that the ""Port letters"" (39A) were USs leading to AsIp for ""Not that much"" (34D). (I had FLy for FLU (37A), leading to ySl instead of USS for ""Letters on a bow"" (38D). Yves St. Laurent makes bows, right?) I had no idea what the ""Pole used for extending a sail"" (47A) was, but I knew lPRIp was not a word. I eventually got the FLU and ended up with two USS answers - a big BOOBOO in the Xword world - and knew I had to AXE ONE. I finally got ONTOPOFIT and heard the happy DONEZO music. A fun solve all around and not DRAB at all!",17,neutral,0.619918942451477
"I call a Natick. There‚Äôs no way an average person living under a rock can get from DOJe, oNe SEC, and TSWoZZLE to what it needs to be without hours‚Äîhours! (okay, 5 minutes‚Ä¶ but it was a very long five minutes)‚Äîof scanning the grid for typos. 

Before I get mobbed: I have nothing against Taylor Swift and appreciate her immense talent‚Äîeven if I miss the twang in her guitar now. But I read my news instead of watching it so I miss the entertainment stuff (we like it quiet down here, under our mossy rock). 

Now, before y‚Äôall say there was a hint down there below with QB SACKS because, yeah, I get it, from QB to wide receiver, to Taylor S., etc., I‚Äôm going to stop you right there: QB SACKS does *not* make one think of my man Mahomes.

Some very clever fill and clues.,12,positive,0.8995843529701233
"The first thing I noticed about this puzzle was the number of odd consonant combinations there were:  VRH, TSW, NTJ, along with the texting acronyms TTYL and SMH.  A long time ago, when I was new at solving crosswords, I would immediately assume that I'd had something wrong if, say, TSW or VRH came up at the beginning of an entry.  Now I realize that these combinations don't have to be parts of one word.

These combinations were a little disconcerting anyway, throwing me off just a little, despite the fact that I didn't get seriously stumped in any part of the puzzle and finished with a rather good time for a Saturday.

The second thing I noticed that there were a lot of uncommon letters in the puzzle and I wondered whether this was a pangram.  Not surprised to find out that it's actually a double pangram.  However, this is not even close to a record; the Aug. 10, 2016 puzzle was a quintuple pangram!",35,neutral,0.6471198797225952
