"Thoroughly enjoyed this one, thank you Alice and Christina. 

So many possibilities that seemed to fit, but you have to go back and make it work.  It was an exercise in persistence and patience. 

 Favorite clues : OMELETTE, BIAS CUT, SURFEIT

Enjoyed OH HELL NO, IN A GOOD WAY plus many others

I echo all the tips from Deb, this is exactly how I approached this new hobby.  I would also add reading Wordplay regularly, and periodically using the Check function when wading into the later week puzzles.  It helps build the required logic in the brain, and eventually you gain confidence to not have to use them.  Only then could I claim to have legitimate streaks lol.  Previous ones were just practice! :)",0,positive,0.9480504989624023

"Tough but fun-  little slower than average, especially after flying through the entire north section of the grid, but a satisfying solve.

One nit to pick:
I felt the wording of 56a was odd, maybe a miss by the editors; surely that was supposed to be ""sites"", no? In the context of this clue, ""sights"" just feels like a reach. Maybe just my personal preference. Either way, great puzzle.",2,positive,0.8667677640914917

This morning‚Äôs Connections helped with CRUMBS to start. I‚Äôm never sure of SABER/SABRE but I should be having spent most of my life on this side of the pond. 
Getting to 1000 has been a quest. First it was just get to 365. 730 didn‚Äôt have a ring to it so I kept going with my morning ritual in the hopes of hitting this. There were a few technical glitches and an occasional oversight on my behalf. Mostly caused by travel across the Date Line or being off the grid for days and then solving in the wrong order.

I'm kinda proud I worked it out!

"Solved it unaided, but took me almost 50 minutes. Thank goodness for the reference to ""Sun God"" in the clue for 3D, or I might well have been naticked by the crossing of RAMI and AMONRA.

Slowed down by entering PARANOIA rather than SATANISM for the theme in Rosemary's Baby. Fit perfectly with ABLE, AMUSING and NAMATH, which were the crosses I had at the time. 

Unfamiliar with BIASCUT and AUDRE, but ""U"" seemed the only sensible choice for their intersection.

On the whole, a solid Friday puzzle, with some interesting entries: WINEGRAPE, SURFEIT, SOAPBOXPREACHER. A few too many uses of ""S"" to create plurals to hold the grid together, but otherwise nicely constructed.

And just to quibble, I'm not sure I'd call a RADIAN a unit. For example, the radian measure of a right angle is simply œÄ/2. It's a pure number, being by definition the ratio of two lengths. But, of course, ""Trigonometry unit"" works fine in a crossword puzzle.",6,positive,0.5926342606544495

"Loved it.

Challenging and counterintuitive. Lots of unfamiliar terrain with a handful of reliable supporting clues to give us amateurs a chance.

IN A GOOD WAY above an OUNCE of regret works well. COAL CART was tough to let go of, as well as OMITS for DOFFS.

Cheers.",10,positive,0.844136118888855
"A tough one with lots of competing possibilities, 

I hesitated between secant and cosine for 2D, and then saw it was neither.  I had lodging for Quarters, omit for DOFF, Elon for OLIN, and SABre for SABER.

Got NEED-based admission through the crosses, and had to look up after to see what it meant. I thought the admission referred to bars, not universities. 

All in all, a very satisfying puzzle.",13,neutral,0.6025197505950928
"This one felt tough but fair! I thought it was a great Friday - took a long while to work through it, but it wasn't overly referential and besides TITO (which I had filled in as SKOL initially) I wouldn't say any single answer really stumped me. 

Lots of good 'oh, that's what it is!' aha moments too, which is always satisfying. I particularly loved SOAP BOX PREACHER as the answer for 'Figure of speech?' - that was a fantastic clue and a lovely chunky answer.",13,positive,0.9480997323989868

"Medium difficulty for me, not nearly as troublesome as yesterday's otherwise boring theme Thursday.

I do love the word ""surfeit"" - it doesn't get used nearly enough - but the rest of the today's puzzle left me a little cold.  Neither IDidIndeed nor UhYes nor (especially) SoapboxPreacher were very good at all in my opinion.  Really could use some more wit / humor.

Ah well.  Tanagers and no emus.",2,negative,0.680773913860321
"I got the hemi-demi-Semiramide blues! Three kinds of food love: an omelette, deep dish, & cooking for a partner, maybe a Crawfish √âtouff√©e, oui madames? Also, not least among this puzzle's surfeit of great moves, there's the soap box preacher soundly denounced by some rude passer by: Oh h*ll no! 

And there you have it, let's breathe in, for the Great Ado is about to begin! Amon Ra in one corner, the subject of much vaguely satanist album art in the 70s, his skin a glowing coco de mer, padre of the finite universe, sire of you and you and ewe! In the other corner: Indiana Jones, Joe Namath, Audre Lorde and Robin Hood, all from blended people, and wouldn't you know it, they're drunk! Triple sec, sweet muscat wine, and waiter, more of that Tito! They think this is just some amusing bar game, and the winner will pick up the tab.

You want another pint of St. Pat's finest green beer? 

Uh, yes?

Robin Hood doffs his cap, Audre recites an amusing poem about people you can't stand (in a good way), Joe Namath passes...out, and Indiana Jones is down to his last two quarters...but then, in an act of love, Tito Capobianco rushes in to direct the final scene! He pours every ounce he had into it, and in the end, all that was left of him were a few precious crumbs. Oh, blessed Tito -- Act of love.

Really great puzzle, jolly and enjoyable throughout, it really gave as good as it got, in a good way. A very good way.",25,positive,0.8856580853462219

"I cruised through the upper third without too much trouble.  But then things slowed down in the lower two thirds and for a while I thought OHHELLNO.

"Ah, anecdotes‚Ä¶ the CLASSIC is one that fails to be CONCISE because the teller stuffs in too many irrelevant details. That kind should be ILLEGAL.
Another POPULAR but AWKWARD type is the MEDICAL saga. They invented ‚ÄúTMI‚Äù for those.
Anecdotes that are STRANGE, UNUSUAL or CURIOUS are WELCOME - we see some of those offerings here at wordplay.

But yes, at the very least we hope they are AMUSING.",18,negative,0.750021755695343
"Despite eating a SURFEIT at the Yankee Stadium buffet, as I do during most home games, I've never heard that word before in my life.

Crossed with UHYES when that U could have accurately been an a or o was unique challenge. I did not know AUDRE Lorde, either, but I figured AUDRE and AUDiE were the only possibility spellings. Six possible guesses, fortunately I had everything else correct.

20 minutes, kinda slow for a Friday.",4,neutral,0.5929828882217407
"As opposed to many other recent late-week puzzles, I did not whip through this one filling in answers without much pause between entries. This one made me stop and think. 

To further embellish on Deb's suggestions for solving tough puzzles, some of the ""rules"" I go with on a harder day include:

1. Answer the ones you know first, regardless of where you need to start. 
2. Don't guess until absolutely necessary.
3. When you do guess, be flexible enough to yank a word that doesn't seem to play well with the crosses.

I thought for sure that 1A had to be TUNA.  Of course, it wasn't.  (Just like 7D wasn't A TAD, and 46D wasn't SHORE.)

In my opinion, looking up answers is cheating like training wheels is cheating.  Do it if you need to, but try to build up to where you don't as quickly as possible.  It's fine for anyone to solve at whatever level they're at, but it's much more rewarding to get to the point where you're not looking things up.

And if it doesn't bother you to look things up, it doesn't really matter what I think.",37,neutral,0.6014524698257446
"This one seemed really tough at the start--I had very little early on and really thought that I wasn't going to get anywhere with it--and then it slowly filled in. I got a tiny boost when I got OLIN college, which I only knew because they started to build it when I was still living next door in Wellesley, Mass.

I keep looking at BIASCUT in the finished puzzle and thinking that I've massively misspelled BISCUIT.

Overall, I think this was an excellent puzzle. Like Deb, if I had paid more attention to the clue, I might have figured out AMONRA a whole lot faster than I actually did.",31,negative,0.38867542147636414
