But these guardian angels of the grid are often irksome and condescending. It's just a different opinion, okay? Not every differing thought has to be corrected. Thank you.

"I have not read the comments yet to get everyone's take on it but I loved it!!

EYED A HOE was the first themer that I figured out. Loved it immediately and pretty quickly filled out the rest of the them, except the Kendrick one. I wasn't immediately familiar with her name, though I know I have heard it before. The only thing of her's that I think I've watched is The Accountant.... and some of the crossings there took me a little longer but once I had the NA on the end, I was able to puzzle it out! 

Some of the state puns were stronger than others but they were all fun! My favorite was the state I was born and lived in half my life --WHISK ON SON! I thought that one was hilarious!  (Although very soon I will have lived in another state represented in today's puzzle *more* than half of my life, which kind of feels weird but also good because I  jive more with MINI SODA!) 

MISS IS ZIPPY was another favorite! 

I enjoyed a lot of the other clues too, especially the rulers that make a lot of crosswords for TSARS. 

I thought the BFF one at 1D was a little weird and I originally had Bros there. So very many spouses/partners consider the other their best friend. My husband and I don't (in a good way) but I know a lot of people who do. 'Twas fine, just seemed a little odd to me. 

Got it in good time, better than average, no lookups, and no errors! Huzzah!!

"When does a collection of puns that are unremittingly and excruciatingly dreadful suddenly MORPH into ""Hey, not so bad at all"" and become fun to figure out?

Answer: When they have a raison d'etre theme that ties them all together and makes even the worst of them guessable.

FLOOR IT DUH was perfectly awful in every way imaginable -- and I hate, hate, hated it when I filled it in.  ""You call this a pun?"" I said to myself.  ""I mean, really.""

But then what looked like it was going to be a Mississippi pun started to come in.  There was a fast-running ""she"" who was obviously (and from my crosses) a MISS.  Aha, she IS something!  What IS she?  Hmmmm.  Aha -- ZIPPY!  Yippee, this is sort of fun, after all.  It's going to be puns of STATES. I notice the terrifically apt title for the first time.

And I'm off and running to find as many state puns as I can without crosses.  Gotcha, MINI-SODA!  Gotcha, WHY OMING!  Gotcha, HUH WHY E!  Gotcha, WHISK ON SON!

I needed many, many crosses for the others -- and I had to cheat on RHYS to get TEN ASEA. But I ended up having a very good and, in its own way, challenging time with this.

"In addition to having many laugh-out-loud moments, I had a spark of pleasant memory at 87D with its clue ""Cloisonn√© technique"". It reminded me of the discovery of the so-called Staffordshire Hoard, and how thrilled I was to be able to see up close some of the finds  at the NatGeo museum in Washington, DC. I remember being amazed at the smoothness of the garnets that were embedded in the gold casings. The technique was described as cloisonn√©, which was my first exposure to that word. Below is a link that includes some pics of articles from the find that were crafted with what they call ""Garnet cloisonn√©"":

"OMG. Absolutely terrible, painful groaners. And they were perfect -- I loved it!! It felt like the Sunday puzzles of the 70s and 80s, in the best possible way.  Sure, maybe some themers landed better than others, but the overall effect was sheer bliss, making me feel 50 years younger.  I struggled some in the middle (around PLAITED and LETMEGO in particular), and it took me a while to figure out why DELL was in there.  The fill was mostly fine to good but mainly there to get me to the next themer.  They did get easier after the first few but all were tremendous fun. Thank you Ginny Too for one of the most wonderful Sunday puzzles I've seen in a long, long time.  And a debut!  More soon, please!!!",27,positive,0.9622185826301575

"This was great fun once I figured the theme. Unfortunately my first themer was MISS IS ZIPPY, and I decided that, because of ‚Äúmisstated‚Äù, they would all have something to do with MIS or MISS (instead of picking up on the ‚Äústate‚Äù aspect).

As a kid, I wanted to shout ""FLOORITDUH"" to my parents on the long drive to Disney World from INDIEANNA, instead of wasting precious time staying the night in TENASEA. One of my best friends lives in VERGEINYEAH, and when I visited her last year I took the Acela ([Express method used to make many crosswords?]) to DELLAWARE to check that one off the list. When I lived in Montana for a summer internship, I took the slow train over to EYEDAHOE and OREAGAIN as well; I learned my lesson after getting a speeding ticket in MINISODA on my way out there.

I loved MISSISZIPPY, EYEDAHOE, and WHISKONSON (which is where I‚Äôm originally from).

It took me longer than it should have to catch on to the state theme (I neglected to check the title before solving), but I finally had enough crosses to get MINISODA for coke-ette.  I felt like a cartoon character with the light bulb winking on above my head and raced to fill in the rest of the holes in my map.  This nicely capped off a good late week run of puzzles.

"I dunno if I recall ever actually laughing out loud several times throughout a crossword puzzle before this one. Oh, I remember puzzles that delighted me and probably inspired exclamations of delight (I think at least one Jeremy Newton puzzle, among other puzzles), but in this one the Dad jokes were so perfectly wonderfully awfully silly, I loved 'em. Guffaws were had. Just a really fun, playful, silly and witty puzzle that reveled in punnery. Excellent.

I felt just a little Naticked for a while by 7D ERDOS crossing 27A COS (never took Trig in school but figured it was probably COS), then discovered the snag was a simple overlooked wrong letter at 57A/57D, just didn't notice I had an typo'd O there instead of an I(NLAY), fixed it and got the congrats!

Loved 120A, what a wonderful winky and fresh take on this oh-so-common crossword clue. Tsaright. Silly, playful, smart and fun puzzle.

"What a gift Ginny Too has for witty puns and what a gift she has given to us with this delightful puzzle.  When the first state emerged I knew what I would be looking for and I was looking forward to every single one.  TENASEA was a killer and the fun wasn't limited to states‚Äîwho wouldn't be laughing about [Rulers used to make crosswords?] and [V-six or V-twelve?] ‚Äî not engines?  

I was disappointed that flounder was too long and lost out to HALIBUT.  Many years ago we had peerless fried flounder at a McAllen,Texas, motel restaurant (of all place), fresh when the Gulf of Mexico was fresher, and just the thought of it makes my mouth water (CA suppertime here).

Thank you so much, Ginny!  Only one look-up, but not a breeze to work, and all those ingenious state concoctions were inspired.",20,positive,0.9336187243461609

"I was confused about the theme until I finally got 86A, then it was a fun ride after that. I agree with others that 102A was a strrretch. Loved 28A, 80A, and appreciated a new take on 120A. Didn't outright know 7D and cross with 27A didn't help (another math reference?) forced me to guess. But major congrats to Ginny (and her dad, by proxy). Great job!",7,positive,0.934769868850708

But too much rides on the expectation that solvers pronounce names the same way the constructor does: Orre-gon vs Orre-gin;  Hawaii (Hah-why-ee/huh-why-ee) vs. Hawai'i (with okina mark), Wis-cahn-sin vs. Wis-con-sen, etc.  On the USMAP, there's too much regional diversity.",7,neutral,0.4939383268356323
"Wow, what an impressive debut!  Twelve themers and not a DUD in the bunch.

"Flatfish (e.g. halibut) start out in life vertical (dorsal fin up, anal fin down, one eye on each side); as they age, they turn 90¬∞ so that one side is down, the other up. As they do so, the eye on the down side migrates to the up side. Protective coloration in most fish is dark on top, light on the bottom. In flatfish, the down side turns light, the up side dark. Most flatfish are righthanded: their right side is the up side. A minority are lefthanded: their left side is up. For some reason, lefthanded flatfish are more susceptible than righthanded flatfish to cancer and organ damage caused by pollutants. The fisheries agencies of the European Union therefore monitor lefthanded flatfish as an indicator of ocean pollution.",62,neutral,0.8634428381919861
