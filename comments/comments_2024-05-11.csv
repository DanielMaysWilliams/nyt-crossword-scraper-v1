Nice cheerfully chewy Saturday puzzle, thanks, Billy.
Is there a sub-specialty of Billy GOAT YOGA?

Agree that SAMANTHA WHO is pretty obscure, but the descriptive clue led me to the answer once I had a few crosses in there.

Oh, sure, it creates five mini-puzzles, which is scary, because it‚Äôs Saturday, and the corners don‚Äôt get much help from the center, but praises to the constructor and editor for intelligently placing footholds to make the puzzle fair.

The grid pattern was done once before in the Times, 4/18/20, by Ryan McCarty. What marked that puzzle was the pop in the center.

Another ‚ÄúHah!‚Äù followed the serendipitous cross of SIT HERE and a backward SAT AT.

Some other clues gave me a nudge in the right direction, but it still took me a while to see what they were saying, so to speak.  

And TOOOLD?? That string of o's was well placed  So rude. Remember, I'll be 90 in a couple of months and although, like the lady said (thank you, Bette), getting old ain't for sissies, it is mostly a point of view: You may not be the LEAD DOG, but if you ignore the BATTLE SCARS, you'll still have enough bits and pieces of the TOTAL ASSETS to see you through. 

Thank you Billy Bratton for oiling up the cylinders a bit and giving me a jolly evening.  How many more Saturdays have you got up your sleeve?  Let's see 'em.",37,neutral,0.6460596919059753

"Pretty hard but doable in the end.  I didn't really enjoy this one much.  (So it was Interesting to learn it was largely machine generated.)

I also thought cheerio was a greeting, not a farewell.

"Very much fun. 

Had to tinker awhile with the combination of
DAR ES SALAAM
TATAS
SHALE

It all made sense in the end. 

Thank you!",6,positive,0.9428050518035889

"What an elegant grid to house a nice chewy puzzle, with  lots of twisty and witty clues.  There were lots of general knowledge questions that were outside my ken, but the couple I knew (e.g. DARESSALAAM, ALDO) gave me just enough footing to piece it all together, although I struggled mightily in the SE corner.

I liked the triple Os in TOOOLD. I don‚Äôt like to carp about clues, but cats meow for any kind of food, but fair play, I guess.

For any not familiar with ALDO Leopoldo, his Sand County Almanac is an early expression of the environmental movement. Leopold preached awareness of our natural surroundings and respect for same.  It is simply and elegantly written.

MIXTAPE, brought back memories of many hours crafting personalized sonic messages on cassette tapes for friends and family, and sometimes would be lovers. First came the planning to find songs that would make sense together and convey my message while filling up as much of each side of the tape as possible.  Then came the gathering of the albums and the actual fabrication of the tape with the careful placing of the needle on the disc, monitoring the volume level and fading the songs where appropriate.  Every tape represented hours of work, and any mistake was costly (in terms of repair time).  It‚Äôs so much easier today when a creditable playlist can be constructed in no time flat online.  Somehow though the labor involved in making them the old fashioned way made them much more personal.",39,positive,0.8067218065261841
"A relatively smooth solve with the exception of the SE corner. Of course I first tried SAME HERE but it didn‚Äôt last long, since I was sure of FARE, and F_H__ looked very wrong. 

Excellent clue for IT‚ÄôS HOT and a clever misdirect with ‚ÄúGross home?‚Äù (my first thought was Net).  

Nice crossing of STYLE with ELLE, and I love the clue ""Si elle lit elle lit Elle"" (If she reads, she reads Elle).",26,neutral,0.41338256001472473
"I took a break from this fun puzzle to see the aurora borealis from the front of my house!

Absolutely stunning. And so amazing to have the northern lights come to me after so many years of wishing I could go to them. 

Then, when I came back inside, the southeast quadrant of the puzzle fell into place (though in black and white rather than green and purple). 

Quite a Friday night!",58,positive,0.9665707945823669
"I tried goat yoga class but the instructor would not leave me alone for more than a minute. A real nanny. But the Happy Baby asana was a different beast. 

I was kidding. I‚Äôm a capricious silly billy.

"Me to self: ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt it be funny if this answer is GOAT YOGA?‚Äù
And then: ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt it be funny if this one is ATTILA?‚Äù
Ha, most of the time those predictions end up being funny but wrong.

Hope all our northern friends are playing SAMESIES sharing photos of the amazing aurora tonight!",23,positive,0.531654417514801
I liked this puzzle alot. Lots of white first time through then got MIXTAPE and DAR ES SALAAM and things started falling into place. GOAT YOGA was a new one for me. I had GORP YOGA at first.,7,positive,0.9688674211502075

Really good puzzle....couldn't for the life of me figure out what an IT SHOT is. Ha.,26,positive,0.9164249897003174
"Good puzzle but it took a while to make any IN ROADs. I considered looking up an answer but decided I WOULDN'T, it's not my STYLE. I decided I would SIT HERE and LEAN in and one LITTLE THING fell at a time and I came through without too many BATTLE SCARS.

When I finished I thought I'd SEXT the MRS about TATAS but instead of saying ITS HOT she called me a CREEPO. Guess I'm TOO OLD.",66,negative,0.6238583922386169
