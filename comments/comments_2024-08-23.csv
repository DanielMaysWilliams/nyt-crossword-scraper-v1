"I had what is for me a rather common experience: everything filled except the ‚Äúopening‚Äù corner, top left. All I had was sine, for a long time.

Stop for ‚Äúorgan piece‚Äù was, for this professional organist, an interesting entry.

‚ÄúPulling out all the stops‚Äù is a relatively well-known expression and comes from the world of the pipe organ. On a pipe organ, a row of pipes that make the same sound but at different pitches is a ‚Äúrank‚Äù. The pipes in a rank are sitting on top of a chest of pressurized air so that, when a key is pressed, a valve opens to admit air to the pipe corresponding to that key. But there is a slip of wood with holes drilled in it that slides back and forth, either closing off the flow of air (stopping it) or admitting air (opening it) to that rank. When the knob for a rank or group of ranks is pulled out, the holes line up and the pipe gets air and sounds: so ‚Äúpulling out all the stops‚Äù means ‚Äúthe whole shebang‚Äù: letting every sound sound; nothing held back.

A good organist knows to unleash that full sound judiciously, so that the power of the instrument is held in check until the right moment. Unfortunately, too many organists do not understand this‚Ä¶

"Very pleased I didn‚Äôt have to fly speck on this one. I‚Äôve had a lousy streak of not getting a gold star without a second (or 100th) pass over these last few weeks. 

I haven‚Äôt checked the consensus on whether this was a hard or easy puzzle yet, but, for me, it felt just crunchy enough for a Friday. A bit under average, but right in the Friday sweet spot. 

Taylor and Rafael, I had a good time and I thank you!",14,positive,0.529139518737793
"My math skills are deteriorating.

It took me way too long to get 1D.",6,negative,0.8745979070663452
That answer is not a synonym for ‚Äúchichi.‚Äù Delete the ‚Äús‚Äù and you have one.,2,negative,0.6743015050888062
"SW was tough for me. I had no idea what 33D was, had meA at 44a for way too long which really fouled me up on 32D, and chichi was not a term in my vocabulary. Otherwise felt pretty straightforward and eventually got there.",2,negative,0.6337360143661499
"As a pediatrician I should point out that 11D should probably be ‚ÄúOral vaccine target, ONCE‚Äù. Oral polio vaccine hasn‚Äôt been used in the US at least for 25 years. I suppose it may still be used in developing countries.

Also, anyone else think ‚ÄúHow Firm a Foundation‚Äù might be a Serta slogan?",35,neutral,0.8064917922019958

I don‚Äôt know AVEDA from AtEDA so I had IHAtETORUN instead of IHAVETORUN.,7,neutral,0.611321210861206
"I thought this was a good Friday  puzzle in difficulty. Cluing was excellent and grid was superb. I dumbly put down down 'Hank"" instead of Thad for the jazz trumpeter on my first pass.",5,positive,0.9112153053283691
"""PWN"" looked so wrong, but it was what the crossings dictated. So TIL a new term. And ""amen"" to John H.'s comment on 33D.",4,neutral,0.5420830249786377
Started out fast but definitely had to ARMWRESTLE to see the BIGPICTURE in the SE corner. Good Friday!,16,positive,0.9707833528518677
"I ARMWRESTLEd with this one a bit.  I didn‚Äôt have a thing until ILEX, and there were quite a few names that I didn‚Äôt know (NANCHERLA, SARA Shepard, KESHA) which left some gaps.  I did, however, know ESAU, IAGO, and fine jazz trumpeter THAD Jones, which helped me get started.  Before long I had enough fill to begin to see the plethora of phrases and I ended up with an averagish Friday time. It was a perfectly fine puzzle, but not one that particularly tickled me.",5,neutral,0.6721284985542297
"Another quick puzzle this week, though there were some pretty fun ones in there. 26D felt a bit shaky but overall nice, just a bit easy for a Friday.",1,positive,0.9760649800300598
I flew thru the top half and got stuck for a while on the bottom.  Last to fall was the middle right with 33D being a little unfair.  Got it thru the crosses.,5,neutral,0.686164140701294
