"@Deb Amlen Thank you, Deb, I have so much fun reading your column (after the solve) and often finding so much I missed. They truly enrich the joy I have every day with solving the crossword.",15,positive,0.9669341444969177
"@Deb Amlen I hate a rebus and this made me long for one. While the theme was clear, it lacked cohesion/elegance if you will -- just unrelated words. I also, as others have pointed out, feel the editors should have flagged the JAPE/JAPE crossing. But hopefully this is the biggest ""problem"" I have all day!",22,negative,0.9117310643196106
"@Deb Amlen 
We pronounce things so differently, that's why it doesn't work so well.  The worst was ""depot"" (dutchoven)  I don't say DEE-POT, I say Dee-Poe (as Poe, the writer).  I did like the clue for air guitar, so it wasn't a completer stinker.  I thank you for your clues, I never would have finished without them!",8,negative,0.7626341581344604
"Dear @Deb Amlen,
 
Except for Mondays and some Tuesdays, I always need to follow your advice to step away for a bit when stuck and come back later with a fresh perspective.

Today I needed to switch platforms (from phone to laptop) to fill the last bit. 

Usually it's the other way around, since the phone allows me to see the Ds horizontally.

Whew, that was a trek.",12,positive,0.8491946458816528
"@Deb Amlen: Loved your David Attenborough version! I can hear him saying it. (Sotto voice of course, so as not to startle the predator.)",24,positive,0.9544141888618469
Just a terrible puzzle.,72,negative,0.9097899198532104
"It felt to me like years went by while I sat and stared at
MADA SHELL.

Maybe a shell from Madagascar? 
And so I (actually) Googled MADA SHELL. 
Ah, a shell so rare and exquisite that even Google hasn't tracked it down.

Thank you, Mr. Schoenholz.
I shall always treasure this duh moment of mine thanks to your puzzle.

You see, it didn't make me MAD AS HELL.
It just reaffirmed that I don't need a DOOBIE to trip out! 

After a million face palms and laughter galore, 
I think it's time for me to call it a night.",92,positive,0.7872263789176941
