"This was almost a ""gotcha"" by the constructor. But I don't know if it was intended. I was not familiar with Ne-Yo. (Now I am.) I had SIP for ""Soak (Up). Therefore going down I had Neyi. With the puzzle filled in I got the message I was close but not quite. As I checked for spelling errors I searched Neyi and found Neyi Zimu, also a singer. https://spiritmusicgroup.co.za/artists/neyi-zimu/
Still thinking that was correct, it took me some more time to change SIP to SOP. A better fit for the clue.",0,neutral,0.786996603012085

"And... what the heck - one more late puzzle find. This one pretty remarkable. A Sunday from November 8, 2015 by Tracy Gray with the title: ""Three-Peat.""

Took me a long moment to figure out what was going on, but nice moment when it dawned on me. Don't recall ever seeing one like this before. The clues were straightforward so I won't list those. It's the answers... Some examples: 

CONANTHEBARIAN
ENTECORDIALE
CHIHUAMEXICO
TRAINEDASSINS
ALFASPROUTS
REPOSSEDCARS
MISSIPPIMUDPIE

And then on that day's puzzle, Jim Horne posted a comment that included a link to all possible answers that would have a string that fits that repeated 3-letter pattern.  Quite amazing... 719 answers that have actually been in a puzzle. Here's that link:

"Oh - one more late puzzle find, inspired by a search for our constructor's surname. Nope - Dershewitz has never been in a puzzle, but I considered an alternate spelling and that led to a Sunday puzzle from September 1, 1996 by David J. Kahn with the title ""Who said that?""

"I went through this one pretty fast so I didn't even look at the theme until afterwards. Fun one! At first I was a little underwhelmed by just the circled notes but then it was a fun aha when I noticed the notes were all POST IT! Very nice Monday!

Apparently I'm not working today. I know that because I find myself not working... Is that circular reasoning?  I'm pretty nervous about something this afternoon and couldn't focus, so I threw myself into an archived Friday puzzle... March 24th, 2023. I didn't really enjoy it that much, possibly because of aforementioned nervousness, but also the clues and answers were all just a little bit bland to me so I don't know... but the grid was awfully neat!  In my short time doing these and the archives, I don't think I've ever seen a grid that was all just vertical black squares. I'm probably not describing it correctly but I thought it was kind of cool. 

I really only glanced at a few comments on it this time, so I'm not sure if that was remarkable to others who know about these things or not. There were a lot of emu issues t that day, so I came back over here instead.",4,positive,0.9203500747680664

"Finished almost twice as fast as my average for a Monday which is what happens when I am able to solve every clue correctly on first pass (rare!). Enjoyable and cute theme, but the theme was not necessary for the solve and overall the puzzle could have used a little more grit in my opinion, but sometimes what seems easy to others is not to me, and vice versa. Anyway, it’s nice to get a quick start to the day and I appreciate the construction.",4,positive,0.9663885235786438

When I got to the revealer, I looked back and saw the ""it""s and the musical notes.  Ha!

"Oh, the horrors of low-rise pants. TO PUT IT MILDLY, I have been totally REPELled by the many sights on display since they have become the norm.  There are so many things I wish I could UNSEE.  I mostly keep my EYES averted, but sometimes it's just right there in front of me.  I wonder if it's RUDE to mention to someone bending over that their pants RODE down lower than they might think and are now IN A SPOT that they might wish they weren't. Maybe it would be welcome, but I never take the chance.

As for the wearing experience, why are women forced to pull up their pants every time they STAND up?  Pants used to stay where they belong, but I guess it's too expensive to make pants that accomodate a human form that includes a waist that is smaller than the HIPS.

"Long, long before I was anywhere near the revealer clue or had looked at the length of the answer, I fairly yelled out ""POST-IT NOTES!!""  At that point I had only BREAK IT DOWN and KEEP IT REAL filled in.  So I am feeling quite pleased with myself and perhaps a little SMUG.

A very nice play on words and very nicely chosen themers.  All theme answers are very much in the language and all are well-clued.

I kept wanting PUT IT gentLY at 40A, but GE is not a note. I needed crosses to get MILDLY.  Just couldn't think of it.

Nice clues for OWLET and SPANK.  ROUGE is so yesterday; these days it's BLUSH.  (I'm old enough to have used ROUGE back in the day, but then I'm old enough to have used a rotary phone too.)

A cute theme and no junk.  Liked it!

(A note to whoever wrote the sub-headline in the column:  PLEASE DON'T DO THAT!!!!  Don't completely give away the theme with the word ""musical"".  While I never come to any of the xword blogs before solving the puzzle, I imagine there are some people who do.  The word ""musical"" gives away the whole shebang and there's no way to UNSEE it.  And even if most solvers won't mind, it's definitely not fair to the constructor.  I'd be having a fit if it were done to me, TO PUT IT MILDLY.)",25,positive,0.6806486248970032
"Remember when people (don’t skip over that word easily) used to write and sing songs? When I can’t skip stations on the radio fast enough, I notice that today it sounds like many “artists” post IT notes - voices and instruments vocoded and auto-tuned to a horrifying degree.

"Usually the answer-set stars – sparky entries – are long.  The shorter answers are so often a supporting cast, forgettable glue.  But man, today this puzzle starts off dense with short beauty – SPLAT, MOOCH, UNSEE, TUFT, FLAK, SMUG.  Brava on that!

And the theme – mwah!  Left me wondering why hadn’t any constructor thought of this before.  The perfect revealer, eliciting from me an inner standing-O.

That’s enough to make me a fan of this puzzle, to PUT IT MILDLY.  But then there are lovely serendipities as icing:
• PuzzPair© of EYES and LIDS.
• The GET across and STAND down.
• Lovely contradictory abutting pair of GAGA and PUT IT MILDLY.
• Parallel prepositional phrases with parallel clues UP A TREE and IN A SPOT (Hi, @ Elie Levine!).

Laura, your first puzzle (collabed with Katherine Baiker) also had a primo revealer, with theme answers that ended with same-sounding words, like PIG TAIL TALE and MR. RIGHT RITE, all given wacky clues, with the revealer being AD HOMINEM.  Wow!

So just what will you come up with next?  Anxious to see.  Thank you for a puzzle that left me buoyant!",25,positive,0.6685702800750732

Moveable do accommodates any voice type, as does this charming acute offering.

I see SPLAT is making a big comeback, and each time it's clued I first think it must be THUNK. I have never heard a sound that sounded like SPLAT. No water balloon, paint ball, fat man cannonball, mosquito swatting, stamping on a Macdonalds ketchup packet, big gob of spit against a car window, ever sounded like SPLAT. Splat is to the sound of a toddler hurling his oatmeal to the floor as instant coffee is to real coffee. Yet I love the word SPLAT for trying as hard as a word can to approximate that sound. Splat, you're living your best life. Congratulations on appearing twice this week, dude, you thunk my world.
