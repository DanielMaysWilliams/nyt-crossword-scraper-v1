"Deb says this one is ""one harder"" than the Wednesday puzzle.  I say 21A.

She also says the clue of LAND HO is about pirates.  I think maybe it's about explorers.

She also said that after ""earl"" and ""duke"" was wrong, once she got the L at the beginning of 1A, she realized that the answer was LADY.  Lucky guess; she could have ""realized"", like I did, that it was LORD.",11,neutral,0.8287047147750854

While it's true that VIRTU came from Italian, it is now in the English dictionary:

virtu
noun
vir·tu ˌvər-ˈtü  ˌvir-
variants or vertu 
ˌvər- 
ˌver-
Synonyms of virtu
1
: a love of or taste for curios or objets d'art
2
: productions of art especially of a curious or antique nature : OBJETS D'ART

https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/virtu (and others).

As such, there is no reason to seek a foreign-language marker.  (The presence of the name Machiavelli alone is not one, anyway.  No more so than the clue ""Like Beethoven by his mid-40s"" in the Wednesday puzzle signaled a German-language answer, [the answer was the English DEAF], or did the clue involving Nelson Mandela's CLAN NAME on Saturday [Madiba] need to be in Xhosa.)

I'm sorry to come off pedantic, but if you're supposed to be helping newcomers to understand how crossword clues work, I think your explanation is misleading",5,neutral,0.8745890855789185
