"Today‚Äôs NYT ‚ÄúSolve  a Friday Crossword on Easy Mode‚Äù email has this interesting take by assistant editor Christina Iverson:
_____________

Jerry Hathaway of New York wrote in to ask, ‚ÄúHow long does it take to create a Monday puzzle? Saturday?‚Äù
  
In my experience, the day of week doesn‚Äôt have any relation to how long it takes to make a puzzle. I‚Äôve had Monday puzzles that come together really quickly, and others where I spend hours tinkering with the grid to make sure there aren‚Äôt any hard entries. Similarly, I‚Äôve made Saturday puzzles that just happen to fall into place quickly, and others that don‚Äôt.

Monday puzzles need to be free of any obscure or tough entries, so it can take a long time to perfect the grid. After spending hours on a grid, it‚Äôs common to realize that you‚Äôre stuck with a hard entry that won‚Äôt fly on a Monday and have to go back to the drawing board! Midweek grids are thought to be a little easier to make, because editors are more lenient with what we allow in the grid. Tough names or initialisms that we‚Äôd avoid on a Monday could fit on a Wednesday. Friday and Saturday grids have a lower maximum word count (72, as opposed to 78) so they can take longer to make. It also usually takes longer to write clues for a themeless puzzle than an early-week puzzle. I probably have a dozen themeless grids on my computer that I haven‚Äôt taken the time to clue because writing themeless clues is so much work.

"Not-so-fun-fact: 

The item most often left behind in the ER is a phone CHARGER. Probably the next-most-often is the phone itself. So if you, heaven forbid, find yourself in the ER, have your phone with you but no charger, just ask your nurse, politely please, if there is perhaps a charger you can borrow.

By virtue of my volunteering in the ER, I am aware of the many left-behinds that I have gone looking for, while gloved for health reasons, in rooms that have not yet been cleaned.

And thanks to my husband's recent spate of trips to the ER, I am well aware of the cache of left behind chargers. Of course, some of the really cool beds have chargers on them. But you still need a wire.

Paint by number (usually NUMBERS?) over counters is a nice little thing, and having Marc COHN in here with the constructor being Jesse Cohn is sweet, I don't think I've seen a self referential move like that in years.

"Just barely edged it out.

Took me a long, long time to get the NE corner.  Barely under an hour for the whole thing, but a lot of it was in that area.

22A was brutal, even if it was playful.",9,negative,0.7102490663528442
"This was a good one for me, with a lot of things in my wheelhouse, but made challenging by the fact that the corner quadrants were relatively isolated with only limited linkage to the center of the puzzle.  I struggled a bit with the SE, until I got AVERSE, which led to NOVO (having taken appeals de NOVO as a lawyer, I should have spotted that more quickly), ETCETERA ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

From Beethoven‚Äôs percussively powerful Hammerklavier SONATA to fine guitarist Warren Haynes to Marc Cohn, the puzzle sang to me.  Walking In Memphis has deservedly become Cohn‚Äôs signature song, but for personal reasons my wife and I have a special fondness for his very sentimental True Companion and the tougher Dig In Deep.",19,positive,0.8899711966514587
"Oof. I struggled with this one mightily, and lost a lot of blood in the battle. Almost 7 minutes over my average. 
Nice one, Mr. Cohn.",10,negative,0.7894344925880432
"Nice twist to a lot of clues.
Once you're on the same wavelength as the constructor, you hit the groove and 15D : )",10,positive,0.9163129925727844
Very playful and cute though I‚Äôve never seen ‚ÄúROWR‚Äù only ‚ÄúRAWR‚Äù,114,positive,0.8705761432647705
"ROWR! That was fun.

I surprised myself by getting the MANET anagram almost immediately. Possibly because I'm reading Ruth Reichl's _The Paris Novel_ which involves food and art and Manet's painting of Olympia and the model Victorine Meurent. 

The puzzle didn't quite feel Friday-difficult to me, but I'm not sure that's a problem. I expect Saturday's will be more of a challenge.",16,positive,0.9381698369979858
"Liked the answer for 32A, but thought it would be FINGER PAINTING.

A few nice clues and good fill overall. But this was not a Friday difficulty puzzle.,7,positive,0.8335907459259033
"Interesting how the constructor signed his work at 8D. 

This one was tough‚Ä¶until it wasn‚Äôt. For me, that point was when I realized that 17A wasn‚Äôt a plural word ending in S.
