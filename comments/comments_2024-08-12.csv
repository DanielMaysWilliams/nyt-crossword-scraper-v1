"Add to tricky questions A46, as the surface of Loch Ness is 52 feet above sea level.
 I was flabbergasted to spell out Loch Ness Monster as a ""Cryptid in the Scottish Highlands"".
And I was thinking Hound of the Baskervilles. Not really a cryptid.
Maybe the Floridian Highlands but clearly not the Scots kind.
Overall fun of course.
If there is a Nessie it spends most of its time below sea level. The abyss of Loch Ness is 670 feet below sea level or about half way done to the Dead Sea.",1,neutral,0.6277392506599426

"This puzzle (and the Gameplay column) makes me want to reflect on the concept of MYTHS.

I used to teach a course on Classical (Greek and Roman) Civilization, and I would tell my students not to think of it as Classical mythology, but rather Greek and Roman religion.  We can use the word MYTH, but only if we understood it in its literal meaning as ""story"".  
Just as there are Bible stories (which some people believe literally, others think are interesting metaphors, and yet others think are just nonsense) so we should think of the stories/myths of Greek and Roman (and Norse and Hindu and...) religion.

Would we be comfortable calling them Bible MYTHS?",13,neutral,0.7289825677871704

"Great Monday! And brought back a memory...

About 8 or 10 years ago, when I lived and worked in Milwaukee, a movie was being filmed on the east side. I received a call asking for permission to film part of it in our facility (I worked as the director of marketing and communications in a senior living care complex). After some discussion with our senior staff, we decided to allow it.

On the day of filming, the star of the show walked in, and our gruff and grim security staff turned into mumbling schoolchildren as they stumbled to their feet (I thought they were going to salute!) to greet Sean ASTIN, making his way to the elevator. Addressing him as Sir, geeking out over his resume (""I loved you in Rudy!), all but asking him for an autograph...

I guided him to the elevator and apologized for them on our way up. He was obviously very used to it, and very gracious. 

Oh, the movie? ""The Surface."" Don't bother. The highlight of the movie is seeing my name and all our staff who got used as extras mentioned under the thank-you section in the credits. But it sure caused excitement for one day!",12,positive,0.8326637744903564

"Very nice theme for a Monday puzzle. Some fine six-letter horizontals here: DEMOCD, BUNION, NEWMOM, SEAICE, HEYDAY. ENSHRIINE is also interesting.

A few too many names for my liking: EVAN, ASTIN, DESI, SHAUN, KERRY. Why not alter the tricky TUTSI and invite TULSI to join too? (She can bring the ALE.)

"This must be the earliest I‚Äôve posted. Got up at 5 am as just too hot to sleep.

Oh, the puzzle; cute, fun, fast. A perfect Monday grid. I do get a little bored with ETON though. I understand that it‚Äôs good fill,  being recognisable worldwide, but it grates a little from this side of the Pond, being an extremely elite establishment, inaccessible to most.

This one was very creative, with a smooth flow and a wonderful revealer for the MYTH themers. It made me laugh out loud ‚Äì with one exception. C'mon, now, we all know that the Loch Ness monster is as real as can be...
