"Mr. Donaldson, as someone who hasn't a clue about construction, I didn't understand a word of your notes except for the icing on the cake part, ha ha.  

But what matters is that it  really showcased just how difficult it is to construct a puzzle, and I'd like you to know it's not taken for granted!

I loved the marriage of math and language in this puzzle. The penny dropped for me at the revealer, so I went back and filled in the missing EIGHT of the song, with a big aha also for the other themers I had gotten from crosses. 
Until then, I'd been scratching my head about CLOUD THREE and SWEET FOUR.

Thank you so much for a great puzzle, with just enough bite for a Wednesday, and a fabulous theme.
Truly ingenious!",22,positive,0.4456780254840851
"I‚Äôm just happy to see Homeland clued. 
Such a fantastic and underrated show, and a rare one that kept the quality up throughout the seasons and finished in a great way. 
Also, Peter Quinn remains one of my favourite and most tragic characters, even this long after the show has ended.",13,positive,0.9543368220329285

"In addition to its role in the square root theme, I kind of like ‚Äúcloud three‚Äù as a legitimate concept on its own.  You‚Äôre on cloud three when something marginally decent happens:

I‚Äôm on cloud three! My agent says they finally read the first chapter of my manuscript.

I‚Äôm on cloud three! My favorite band is playing here in 2028.

"Cool puzzle!  A bit chewy, but no look-ups, and very entertaining.  I'm a klutz at math, but this time it didn't matter, and it was so much fun.

"Loved the trick to solving this problem! Especially enjoyed the Paul McCartney clue. I can vaguely remembre thinking how old 8x8 would be when I was about 8! As I close in on that particular birthday, I am waiting to achieve a maturity that my 8 year old self would have assumed for me!!

An observation: I believe ALPO is a brand is owned by the Purina Corp. Don‚Äôt think you could classify them as rivals?

I see the Inuits/Inuit debate elsewhere. As we have learned from Ukrainians in the last few years, language really does matter. As we‚Äôve all managed to learn to call the capital of Ukraine Kyiv, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that big a step to learn Inuk/Inuit as they have asked.",15,positive,0.9204148054122925
"I wondered why McCartney's teen song would be ""When I'm Eight,""  seeing as a teen he would have already surpassed that age. It made more sense when I got to the revealer phrase.  (But I suspect a very young prodigy could write such a song at age five or six, though. After all, Mozart began at age five or so.)  Fun puzzle, all in all!",12,neutral,0.5877792239189148

"That was a good puzzle.  Surprisingly challenging for a Wednesday, complete with a rather complex theme.  I generally knew what was up but didn't really get it until the revealer came together.

Very nice.

"Well that was fast and fun! It probably would have been more fast, but not more fun, if I hadn't gotten distracted by some frolicking bunny rabbits as I sit out here on our garden balcony. And then came along some sort of low flying military looking aircraft, which made the bunnies scamper... üò¨   Anyhow, I forgot to turn off the timer. 

I guess I don't have a super lot to say about this puzzle but I did really enjoy doing it and it was one of my faster Wednesdays! Like Sam, I briefly felt like somewhat of a math genius, which I've never been. I'm really good at practical math, like I can figure out a tip and a recipe modification like a champ, but anything much more complicated is not my wheelhouse.

I also wanted to say that earlier today I finished what I think was the most difficult puzzle I have done in my nearly one year of crossword puzzling! It was in the archives, March 31st 2023....

It was a Friday and I have mostly conquered Fridays without any lookups at all, which is my goal... No lookups ever! I'm not there yet but I'm trying. This one nearly killed me though! I enjoyed it and I learned a lot but ooohwee!  It made me think how far of a way I have to go yet! And I am here for it!!

I'm trying to get all the way through 2023, and then I'll start going back further in the archives.

Time to go in as the mosquitoes are starting to eat me alive!

"Spoiler alert here but ‚Äî

INUITS is a pretty awful answer for describing residents of Nunavut (4D). The plural of Inuk (meaning ‚Äúperson‚Äù) is Inuit (people) - no S needed. Essentially the equivalent of saying ‚ÄúThe Spanishes‚Äù rather than being acceptable like ‚Äúthe Italians‚Äù etc. I‚Äôm not Indigenous so I can‚Äôt comment whether or not it‚Äôs an offensive or upsetting mistake, but I will say it‚Äôs a very easy one to avoid with good research.
