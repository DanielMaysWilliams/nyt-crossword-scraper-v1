"Great debut Dana Edwards.  Loved your puzzle. Whoopdeedoo! 24A was so much fun to fill-in.  And, of course it took me a few to get that 58A clue.  However I had a stack of them with my little portable record player. A necessity for a 50's girl. Nice memory. Our version of an iPod. Of course you had to plug it in.  I did have a plastic radio with D batteries to lug around, but it was that little record player in the vinyl covered lid that clamped shut and had a plastic handle that I loved. 

Cheers from Texas y'all. Lovely start to the week. We are promised a cold front, so will keep you posted.  That gulf just has to cool off soon. These 100 degree days aren't helping limit the development of more fierce hurricanes.  And I am DONE with summer. Stay safe.",8,positive,0.9678587317466736

So the DOUBLE means a two-digit number of whatever the feat is -- a number of 10 or above.

And now for the feats:  # of Points.  # of Assists.  # of Rebounds.  And...?

Is the fourth stat # of Three-point shots made?  # of Blocked shots?  Or # of Foul shots?  I'll go read y'all now and find out.

"A quadruple double? LSUE.

My husband made that up, LSUE. It's a corollary or subset of TIL. I asked him what a quadruple double was, so he googled it,  informed me, and said, [one can] Learn Something Useless Everyday.

So, yeah, sports statistics are pretty useless to me. But I can appreciate that this statistic does acknowledge athletes who are all-round players, not single-skill specialists. Although the four guys who've hit the quadruple double were all over 6 foot 11, so maybe this statistic just says Size Matters.

This was a good, zippy puzzle for a Monday, Dana, thanks.

Well, OK, now I know what it means (sort of), but not being familiar with the sport I can't really appreciate the quadruple double's  rarity.
