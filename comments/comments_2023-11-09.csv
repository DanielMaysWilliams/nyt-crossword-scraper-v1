"Such a fun puzzle!

I've read the word CYCLOPEAN before, and I wondered how far the clue was stretching the definition... No distance at all, it turns out. Merriam Webster gives this:

1 often capitalized : of, relating to, or characteristic of a Cyclops
2 : HUGE, MASSIVE

"Lots of fun. Got about halfway through at breakfast, then off for a hike, and just finished now. I got the theme pretty early on, but had some problems with the SW corner, mainly due to trying to figure out the name of a woman loved by Charles Foster Kane ü§î. I had SNOGS early on, having learned it either when we lived in London, or possibly from British tv shows. I thought long and hard about Citizen Kane, and finally read up on it. (I know some folks think it‚Äôs the best movie of all time, but I‚Äôm not one of those people.) There were no names beginning with O, and I was quite sure about SNOGS, so I finally had a peak at Deb‚Äôs Tricky Clues, where I got CYCLOPEAN. I had only CYCLOP there for quite a while and didn‚Äôt see how that could mean Huge. So now, finally, it all made sense, and I really should have known OPERA, but didn‚Äôt remember that part of the story. I think I‚Äôm babbling just a bit.

"Well, if this isn't just the cutest, cleverest thing!

At first I felt a bit annoyed as those things mucking up my ability to put letters neatly in squares impeded me.  They weren't annoying tiny little circles, so what were they?  I headed to the revealer to find out they were parentheses (and that is what they looked like, after all) and my curiosity was provoked.  Why were they there and what was I supposed to do about them?

I took my usual approach of beginning with answers that didn't have parentheses.  It was a relief to then see that I could fill in the answers that did have them -- without skipping anything or doubling up on anything.  So at least this already-cluttered grid wouldn't get any messier with my own write-overs.

INSIDE OUT blew me away when I finally got to it.  Wow!  Read these answers that way and they all make complete sense.  And they're almost grammatical too!  What a job of construction and what a fabulous revealer.

Won't take you down the path that led to my answer history searches today, but here's the results:

Dawned on me that AMANAPLANACANAL is 15 letters and...
AMANAPLANACANALPANAMA is 21 letters. Was a bit surprised to see that each of those only ever appeared in one puzzle each. The 15 letter version was in a themeless puzzle, but the 21 letter was in a rather remarkable Sunday puzzle from January 12, 2014 by Andrew Chaikin with the title: ITS ONLY ""A"" GAME. 

In that one, for all of the theme answers the only vowel in both the clues and answers was ""A.""

What I disliked:  the forced nature of the readings of the theme answers.  To be honest, I saw RAFTS, PLATTER, OTHER, and CORES, and thought that was all there was to it.  Had to come to the blog to see AFT, LATTE, THE, and ORE, and my reaction was mostly MEH.

The good news:  what I liked outweighed the disliked by a lot.  I much enjoyed today's experience and appreciate the creative efforts by all.",4,positive,0.8279125094413757

"What a cool Thursday! 

I do believe beginning in the NW, 
moving choppily along, 
getting concerned,
filling a couple, 
watch an entire corner just slink into place, 
revealing the theme, 
and then trotting merrily through the rest of the puzzle, is 
my most enjoyable type of solve!

Maybe because it mirrors the way my brain is sipping tea and slowly getting into gear for the day.

Loved it.

"Today's puzzle is a good opportunity for DC's advice--which he repeated just yesterday--of looking over the empty grid, to get a sense of what might be going on: obviously, the parentheses meant words imbedded (inurned?) in other words.

"I got the theme, which has been happening more and more often for me on Thursdays, and that I liked about the puzzle. However personally I found the fill itself too hard to be enjoyable. And at the same time it featured  EPEE... When an otherwise hard puzzle resorts to using one of those tired words it looks much worse than in an easier puzzle.

I had to look up some of the trivia, eg. the network of Norah O'Donnell, of whom I have never heard, ditto O'DELL - the only Black Pearl I knew was the ship in the Pirates of the Caribbean ü§£.

SAnDy wreaked havoc at the top of the puzzle for me, and it took me quite a while to realize that was the case.

INURN is a mighty strange word - in the end I knew that had to be the answer but it just looks so... Unnatural. Have any of you ever actually said that in real life?

I go to rock concerts but I care about the experience, not the technology behind it, so I did not know ECHO PEDALS.

I had no idea what fink means, and SEPAL looks like a random assortment of letters to me. I've also never heard of a SENATE PAGE.

So yeah, mixed feeling for me today.",13,neutral,0.44693171977996826

"Some great clues; as a sometime (sort of) geologist 51A was the first parenthetical answer to arise; and INSIDE OUT came afterwards.  I like it when the theme helps the solve, as opposed to being merely a 'How clever!' after-the-fact type moment.   

I spent about 20 minutes with just a little 2x2 white square left where YEOH, CLAP, PHAT and SOLO meet.  Didn't know YEOH; CLAP and SOLO just did not spring to mind; and I thought PHAT was anything but dated but up to the very minute. Which probably dates me.

No, doesn't really make sense.
Next- ""Psycho or the rapist""
What terrible choices, surely they wouldn't put that in a crossword! 

I moved on to fill in CRAFTSMEN, and that was my aha moment as to how to parse out the answer. THE OTHER PSYCHOTHERAPIST. Phew! Makes perfect sense! I filled in the revealer last, which would have been a big help earlier.

"This puzzle took longer than I expected -- not because of the nested themers, but because of the tricky clueing for entries like ABBOT (I had ex-cOn and felOn before letting go) and ANODE (crossing with no-know DRE) (I was thinking something biological before letting go). Well done, Mr. Seigel.

I laughed at 12D (ALIKE) and 58A (NAP) as I filled them in.

One thing I found a bit alarming about 39A is that it also breaks down into PSYCHO THE RAPIST. Another reason to not see that shrink?

I'll close by saying that the revealer (64A) reminded of a cute 2015 Pixar film of the same name. Of the five emotions displayed by the protagonist Riley, I hope most solvers will experience Joy with this puzzle, as opposed to Sadness, Fear, Anger, or Disgust.

"Re 66A: The first mention in literature of ‚Äúa grail‚Äù (Old French un graal) is in Chr√©tien de Troyes‚Äô late 12th century Perceval romance. Since he doesn‚Äôt describe this object, we are left to conclude that it is something so well known it does not need a description; the only hint we get is that it might be used to serve a pike, a lamprey, or a salmon. About 40 years later, Helinand, abbot of Froidmont, describes a graal as a scutella lata et aliquantulum profunda in qua preciosae dapes divitibus solent apponi (‚Äúa wide and slightly deepened dish on which the wealthy are accustomed to being served costly fare‚Äù), i.e. a platter. In the text of the First Continuator, there is a procession of 100 grails, each bearing the severed head of a boar. In the Welsh Peredur, there is only one grail ‚Äî bearing a severed human head. According to Robert de Boron, the grail is the plate from which Jesus took his paschal lamb at the Last Supper. In Wolfram von Eschenbach‚Äôs Parzival, ‚Äúthe‚Äù grail (der gr√¢l) is a stone brought down from Heaven by the neutral angels ‚Äî the ones who did not take sides in Lucifer‚Äôs rebellion against God. Thomas Malory‚Äôs Sangrail could be just about anything: every time it appears, it‚Äôs covered with a cloth. The ‚Äúcup‚Äù idea seems to derive from Richard Wagner‚Äôs Parsifal; the stage directions in Act 1, Scene 2 describe the Gral as both eine antike Kristallschale (‚Äúan antique crystal bowl‚Äù) and a Kelch (‚Äúgoblet, chalice‚Äù).
