"yay puzzle.
I come to praise ""Pinky and the Brain"".
For those of you not familiar, it was part of a major animation renaissance at Warner Bros. thanks to Spielberg. Like the old Warner cartoons (Bugs et al.) it works on multiple levels, so parents can watch it with their kids without being bored, and kids can go back and watch as adults and catch new meanings.

Brain's voice is modeled on Orson Welles (go ahead, you cannot unhear it). In one glorious episode Pinky and Brain have to go to the studio for a looping session (how insane is that?!) and it's largely drawn from Orson Welles' notorious studio melt-down recording a voiceover for a Paul Masson wine commercial. I won't link here, but all is searchable.

Lastly, in every episode at some point Brain asks ""Pinky, are you pondering what I'm pondering?"" and Pinky responds with a total non-sequitor. In our home neither of us can say ""I think so"" without both of us then saying ""Brain"". And I will include a link to 80 of those. ;)

The fill-in before that point had been halting and slow due to no-knows and lovely vague and oblique clues, and even when I had completed many squares, I hadn‚Äôt fully filled in any of the theme answers.  

I had figured out parts of them, knew some of their complete answers, and even understood that some of the letters would be doubled (due to the title and too-many-squares-for-the-answer) but hadn‚Äôt figured out which ones.

The title to the puzzle was as tickling as the theme.

Once again, I learned something I did not know before; namely why ‚ÄúSIC‚Äù is used when one is quoting someone else‚Äôs incorrect use of a word.
