"Congratulations, Tom Locke!
You made a great debut puzzle; it was fun and I loved the word play.  
For a person who hadn't heard of the expression: Huer is an Old French word meaning to shout.  So 'hue and cry' was when people loudly chased thieves, hopefully alerting others to help catch the pickpocket or shoplifter.",3,positive,0.949734091758728

The first theme word I got was in the SE. That word can mean quite a number of things, and I kept scratching around trying for a second word so I could see where we were going. Took what felt like ages! Turns out, my very first inclination for the word association was correct! Woo hoo!

I had to go look up the clue history for HUE and... as I half suspected, it was clued a number of times to the city in Vietnam, though much more frequently in the pre-Shortz era. But anyway... that led me to remember a moment on a firebase in Vietnam - yes this actually happened (might have mentioned this before - I just don't recall). Anyway....

...around sunrise one morning after a number of cloudy, rainy days, as we're all getting up the sky is finally perfectly clear and one of the guys looks out to the east and says ""whoa - you can see the gulf from here."" And someone else says - ""really? Can you see Hue out there.""

After 'wail' and 'bawl,' 'whine' is pretty tame, lame, and diluted....

"I had never heard the phrase ""Hue and cry"" before today, so in that sense the theme fell a little flat for me. But it has sent me down this morning's etymological rabbit-hole.
""Hues and cry"" falls under the English linguistic category of ""legal doublet""--a stock idiom which consists of two (occasionally three) words which are basically synonyms. Often, one is of Anglo-Saxon origin, the other of (Norman) French--i.e. ""Last will and testament""--the idea being that if you didn't understand one, you'd understand the other; although both ""hue"" and ""cry"" are both French. In fact, the first couple citations from the OED, from c., are both from Anglo-Norman French texts. And forget all that nonsense about ""Huesium et clamor""--that is simply a back-translation into contemporary (13th c.) Latin of a phrase that had already existed in French and English. In other words, you're not going to find the word ""huesium"" in Cicero.",10,negative,0.480373352766037

"Anyone else wondering how the ""HUE"" got into the phrase ""HUE AND CRY""?
A quick internet search informs that it isn't related to the HUE of color, but comes from the Middle French ""hu"" which means shout or outcry.
Which, I suppose, makes HUE AND CRY a fine example of hendiadys (like ""sound and fury"" or ""kith and kin"").",15,neutral,0.8010205030441284

*Answer history search today was inspired by a combination of WILCO and ABLE. Wondered about themes that might have involved the phonetic alphabet. Well... ABLEBAKER was an answer once (1971  puzzle) and was clued as:
""_______Charlie.""

"Wow on this theme!  To me, getting from HUE AND CRY to ‚Äúfinding two-word phrases where the first word is a hue and the second is a homonym for a type of cry‚Äù is a huge leap in creativity.  My first thought upon uncovering the revealer was, ‚ÄúHow did he think of this?‚Äù  It‚Äôs masterful, IMO.  Bravo, sir!

The theme got me thinking homonyms, and then they started popping out at me in the grid: WARE, SOAR, LEA, DYE, OWED, TALES, SONS, LYRE, SOME, and, as Sam pointed out, EYEFUL.

Also popping out were lovely four-letter semordnilaps: OGRE, EROS, IRIS, DUAL, ABLE, and ABUT.

Agree with the two Sams on this puzzle, that it's very smooth and lyrical, and the grid design is pleasing. I hope to see more from Mr. Locke, and it's interesting to me that a career in a stressful field like firefighting didn't deter his son from an equally stressful career.
