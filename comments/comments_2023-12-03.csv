"Quite a challenge today and I started late.

Not yet having finished the puzzle, I decided to comment anyway because of the clue leading to the answer ""MARK WAHLENBERG.""

I'd never before heard of Mark Wahlberg; I don't consume much modern culture these days. He is, according
to Wikipedia and other sources, a talented individual who, according to those same sources, displays other attributes which I found to be shocking and highly objectionable. Those familiar with this man already know what I'm referring to.

While i have no objection to his name being included as an answer in this puzzle, I question the anodyne nature of the clue, viz. ""Mark who was the world's highest-paid actor in 2017"". Sometimes, crossword clue writers illustrate insensitivity and this, I'd hasten to point out, is one such instance. How about ""Highly paid actor who strayed in his youth""? (That's the mildest description I could think of.)

Wouldn't the clue ""Former Cambodian leader who went to Paris to study radio electronics"", have raised some hackles
for the answer ""Pol Pot""?

Yes, the clue was accurate, given the answer.

But the individual who wrote the clue didn't seem to  ask himself/herself if it would offend some readers.",2,neutral,0.5733933448791504

"Given how many people complain whenever there is a word in a crossword they did not already know, I think we should create a crowdsourced crossword dictionary. 

Everyone who gripes about words they don't already know will connect a special headset to their head. The headset will have a multitude of electrodes that will probe their brains and download to a master database the entirety of their personal lexicon. 

When the thousand or so whiners who complain whenever a word appear that they don't already know have had their lexicons added to the database, an algorithm will determine the set of words that are known by every single one of them.

This will constitute the set of words allowed in crosswords from that point on. The amount of whining in the comments should fall precipitously after this glossary is put into action.

If the data are available, we could also eliminate all words that these whiners do know, but they just don't like. This should reduce future whining even more. 

I do realize that those of us who have more wide-ranging lexicons, or who enjoy learning of words we have never heard of before, will thenceforth find the puzzles less, well, puzzling and, by extension, less enjoyable, but the tradeoff in reduced whining might be worth the loss of rigor in the puzzles. 

For the life of me, I just don't understand why so many people don't want their puzzles to be puzzling.",11,negative,0.5277163982391357

"Oooohwee! That puzzle took me so long to do that as I read through the comments out here, I can't remember half the clues that everyone is talking about! Which just reminded me that there was a clue in there about something lasting an immeasurable amount of time, eonian, I think it was. (?) It was not a word I knew before but hopefully will remember going forward.  To be fair, it didn't actually take me an immeasurable amount of time, since my app has that little clock on it... 

Like others, definitely some new words for me, which I'm going to review after I go through more comments so I can try to remember them for future puzzles. 

My happiest moment was that I immediately got PELE. I quickly realized it wasn't the great Lombardi and immediately switched to non-US football, of which I know almost nothing except that my husband is a huge fan of Pele. Ohhhh, that also reminds me there is one other thing I knew about non-US football in this puzzle, which was DOHA! That also made me very happy even though it seems like two years ago when I made that entry. I only knew it because of a geography game I started playing right around the time of the World Cup in Doha and it stuck with me. 

Sometimes I wish I didn't have to do things that didn't involve playing these fun games. I wouldn't actually mind spending an immeasurable amount of time on them if only I had it... Which reminds me of that Twilight Zone -- Time Enough at Last. üòä",6,positive,0.6505923271179199

My biggest trouble was with the answer to VOGUE, as my TEENS are well behind and I was wracking my shriveled brain for a French term. As a Philadelphian, football to me did not evoke soccer as it might have others around the globe.    Go E-A-G-L-E-S! So PELE, an easy-peasy fill, was ironically the last domino to fall.

I stubbornly stayed with Cabal, until I finally got junta. 
I was surprised to learn that Mark Wahlberg was the highest earner, since I have no idea what he is in. . And then ratine  crossed with masers really made for a lot of guessing and poking and changing letters.

Thanks to my familiarity with Shakespeare I knew calumny, but for some odd reason I could not remember how spell actor Marks‚Äô last name. I misspelled French ‚Äústop‚Äù with one ‚Äúr‚Äù and two ‚Äúe‚Äù‚Äôs(?), so not the usual smooth sailing.

"Completely enjoyable from start to finish. This is my ideal Sunday‚Äîgot my money‚Äôs worth with a solid hour of entertainment but still beating my Sunday average by about 30 minutes, and not getting hung up enough to resort to lookups. Not that it‚Äôs a competition; I just like stats and the feeling that I‚Äôm getting better at this! Sundays used to be a 3+ hour affair.

Props to the parallels ALOO GOBI and MINI GOLF for setting off a speedy solving chain all across the lower half and much of the right half. I‚Äôm always excited to see Indian cuisine clues‚Äîas a vegetarian who hates cooking, I am very familiar with Indian menus and a huge aloo fan ü•î .  Thanks also to ‚ÄúWelcome to Wrexham‚Äù for featuring the Welsh DRAGON so very prominently in each episode. :)

I didn‚Äôt know MULCTS off the top of my head either but it made sense to me with the crosses, so I‚Äôm not sure what the controversy is. 

WACKADOODLE was one of my last answers to fall into place, but I love it. It reminds me of Julianne Moore‚Äôs character on 30 Rock flirting with Jack Donaghy in the most ridiculous Boston accent, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a wackadoodle, Donaghy,‚Äù which is all the real-life usage I need to keep me from complaining that this isn‚Äôt a real word.

RATINE and MASERS held me up the longest. On my first pass I felt pretty good about RATtan. And though logically lASERS didn‚Äôt make that much sense with the clue, I would never have gotten MASERS without finally sussing out MANILLA (which took longer than I‚Äôd like to admit).",7,positive,0.9581482410430908

"WHAT a surprise! ...was my opening at 1A. Wrong, of course, but it fit. I was intimidated by the grid at first, but I got a firm foothold in the NE, worked my way clockwise and finished in under an hour.

MULCTS is a word I knew, but it wasn't my first guess. I was thinking of the MUrdrum, which is the penalty paid to the crown by an Englishman for killing a Norman.

In the cruel and nasty corner of my mind, I wonder what a Venn diagram of those who hate Sunday themeless puzzles and those who hate Thursday ""tricky"" puzzles would look like.

In any case, I enjoyed this--I was wondering about the theme, but the title of the puzzle gave me an inkling (HINT 83D), and the subhead of the Wordplay teaser ON THE PUZZLE PAGE gave it away altogether. A little bit of a spoiler, there, Will.

"Interesting mix comments thus far. 

I found this to be the hardest Sunday I can remember.  I thought I had zero hope of finishing this. In fact, I didn‚Äôt. The cross of ALOOGOBu /RuFFLES did me in. Thera was zero chance I was gonna find that. Thinking about it now, I‚Äôm shocked that I only had one cell wrong.

PEALED a bell?  That‚Äôs new to me. 

I‚Äôm not sure why some of our prolific veteran commenters are so negative on the themeless. 

I don‚Äôt like Sundays in general because the grid is so big.  Now I guess I understand that a theme usually does shorten my solve time. Because, like I said, this took me a long long time.

When I was a kid my ambition was to become a dress designer‚Äî which was never realized‚Äî and one of my favorite, and certainly most memorable, Christmas gifts from my sister was a box of fabric remnants, so I could make outfits for my fashion doll. Still, RATINE was unfamiliar to me! I was glad I didn‚Äôt get to that clue until crosses had made  ‚Äúburlap‚Äù impossible, since that fit the description perfectly, and would certainly have been my guess! I think that word was the last to fall.  I was vaguely familiar with MULCT, but certainly would concur that that one was also somewhat on the obscure side! Overall, though, this puzz seemed somewhat on the easy side‚Äî although my time was just slightly below average. I didn‚Äôt really mind the puzzle, but if you‚Äôre gonna have a Sunday themeless, I kinda think it needs to be something really exceptional‚Ä¶.",8,neutral,0.5113832950592041
"I may make myself late for work by writing this, but I have to comment on 88D: 
The snobbery of the 9-5 ELITES! Not everyone works a M-F schedule. 
This week, I'm off Tu-We; ergo, my [Time to get back to work: Abbr.] is Thu.

My schedule changes weekly, depending on business, although my bosses try to schedule us two days off in a row. Once my brother-in-law asked my Partner, ""When's Bill's weekend this week?""
""Jim, you know Bill doesn't get a weekend!""
""On the contrary, yes, Jim, my weekend is Tuesday and Wednesday.""

"This one was not for me so I‚Äôm happy that others enjoyed it!

I was excited to see a big themeless with lots of long stacks but found completing it arduous, and not in a fun way. So many obscure words/naticks for me. Most of my guesses ended up correct in the end so I eventually got the gold star but it didn‚Äôt feel like a fun journey to me. I just finished and I suspect that, a few hours from now, I‚Äôll have warmer feelings for this puzzle but didn‚Äôt love this one.",21,negative,0.38832423090934753
"Well - count me puzzled. Kind of a tough one for me, but managed to get through it. Just a nice challenging workout, but I slowed myself down quite a bit by trying to grasp what the theme was. Okay - themeless. I get it. 

Still some things that strike me as odd. A themeless Sunday puzzle, but the longest answers are 13 letters? Just... surprised at that. And then... four 11 letter answers and six 13 letter answers and 7 of those are debuts, but all fairly familiar words or terms. Just.. seems odd. 

And lastly - from Xword Info - this puzzles ties the record for fewest blocks in 21 x 21 grid. One of the others was a Sunday themeless from 11/4 2018 by Patrick Berry. And... 

... that puzzle had EXACTLY the same grid layout. And even the third one in that record tying list had a VERY similar layout - just most of it shifted about one square to the left. 

Brow furrowed. But... well, it's supposed to be puzzling.

"OO LA LA, a Sunday themeless with a lovely grid pattern.  Add to that the clues for CLONING [14A], MEASLES [44A], FRONT ENTRANCE [91A], and also the existence of WACKADOODLE [48A] and FINKED [56D], two great words (actually it's rat FINK that I love, but FINKED is close enough), all making me one happy solver.  

I know some found this too easy, but it wasn't for me.  I parsed the composer name incorrectly and had CARLO R__, didn't know MASERS or where Luzon is (must work on Geography), and thought MANILA had 2 L's so I had to take a leap of faith when I put that M in.  That was my last box to fill and I wasn't convinced it was correct, so I was happy to see a successful solve.

Thank you, Tracy, for one of my favorite Sunday puzzles!",15,positive,0.9381182193756104
"Aloo gobi is a go-to, along with matar paneer, when I'm ordering Indian. And, if I'm lucky, the mixed pakoras are heavy on the gobi, too.  Yum.

Nice big themeless with a nice-looking grid. I like the -lcts ending of mulcts. A quick word search shows that as the only English word with that consonant blend.  ""Walk in place"" was my favorite clue - got a chuckle from me when it became apparent. Thanks constructor!",10,positive,0.89399653673172

"Wow, what a feat constructing this puzzle was!

I had to resort to autocheck but had absolutely no qualms about that considering the large number of obscure answers. Nonetheless, I had tons of fun filling this puzzle in from beginning to end and I learned a few things along the way. 

Hats off to Ms. Bennett!",4,positive,0.9297583699226379
"To RIFFLE through pages implies haste. To ""leaf"" through pages does not and neither does to ""ruffle"". Simply, ""ruffle"" was a more appropriate answer for 92A.

That means that crossing the answer on the delta of this otherwise minor mistake -- the ""I"" in RIFFLE vs the ""U"" in ""ruffle"" -- with the closing letter in ALOOGOBI was an effective natick. So boo. Boo hiss! Added over 8 minutes to my solve time. BOO!

Ah, but I kid and... wait, no I don't. What am I trying to say... I tend not to whine about clues when the overall solving experience was lackluster. Why extend the agony? But I enjoyed this puzzle. The center-east was challenging in the most fun way possible and I was perfectly satisfied when I closed out my main solve just seconds after the clock passed one hour.

Ok, so I worked out what I want to say. From jump to ~ 1:00:15 ... Yay! Great puzzle! Up until 1:08:56 ... BOO! One bad clue. Cheers.",3,neutral,0.5708971619606018

"After 2:09 of work, my jaw absolutely hit the floor when I got a gold star on my last letter entered. At least a half dozen answers were big question marks for me. It was the ‚ÄúN‚Äù in TENON crossing with ISOGONAL that went last. 

It took a long time but, in my defense, I did have half an eye on the Big 10 and ACC Championships. Fun day of college football capped off by a wonderful, beefy puzzle.

"Excellent chewy puzzle that needed thought in every corner. None of it was inaccessible but none of it came easily.  I think I had one gimme - DOHA for the WC.  Oh and NAT Turner.  My general rule is that if I take a guess, as I did for RAMADAN, I need two crosses which seem likely and DACHAS and ALOO something were good enough.  That's how this one built up, slowly and surely to what was, in the end, a decent-ish time.  A good puzzle.",10,positive,0.8975951075553894
"I don‚Äôt always notice the grid design, but this one caught my eye: spare and elegant in its simplicity.  I solved it with no real hiccups, but enjoyed it for the plethora of unusual or little used words, such as CALUMNY (when‚Äôs the last time you used that one in a sentence), CRIKEY, MULCTS, ISOGONAL, and FINKED.  Maybe next Sunday will bring a clever theme, or perhaps a rebus.

Does anyone know when/if Puzzle Mania is due to be released?",9,positive,0.9061062932014465

Token response.

Thus one shoulda had bells, whistles, shooting stars or dancing bears - winding up and down those grid stairs was a mental roundup of words I once knew, thought I knew, ought to know, and just plain forgot! 

Whoo hoo! Another day on terra firma, and happy for all that entails.",11,neutral,0.42702504992485046
"So ""freestyle"" refers to the fact that this is a themeless?

For once, it didn't matter whether I looked at the title.

Well done, Tracy. The grid design is striking and the full is superb. Personally, I'm fine with old words (e.g., MULCTS); crosswords should feature the old as well as the new (see the portmanteaus from the Saturday puzzle).

My favorite clues are ""Super-sillyous"" and ""Month that goes by fast?"".

A great solving week.",22,neutral,0.4838482141494751
"A Sunday themeless! Rare as hen's teeth, sure to get PLENTY a fowl clucking about it: I mean, eonian? Ratine? Mulcts? Cmon! Fantasy series next to lagomorph means Watership Down -- not quite a series, the first novel came out in 1972 & 25 years later a sequel of rabbity tales. I remember reading away at WD and by page 250, I'd had it with them wabbits, it was like a lop-eared soap opera, Watership DOWNER. So I JILTED the rabbits at the ALTAR. Guess I didn't cottontail to it.

Looking over the puzzle I love so much about it, the conjunction of sleep apnea & ear doctor, force field & hellscape,  ancillary words robot with their single isogonal eyes, ETs, cloning, a dystopic Truman Show Era right here on Terra, a constant PR talk of sugar-coated calumnies, which, even if you were enclosing yourself in your escape room and had FOILED your head you'd still hear the VOICE of the Elites, the tsars of Edenstan who, as the anonymous ""Siva"" had written in that banned satire, ""smelled of aloo gobi and cigars.""

Or: a fantasy world instead, with horned dragons that sliced & winked through the sky, their eggs cloned in the aeries above Helena, where natives in their ratine jerseys live in dachas, red cedar totems providing a forcefield that blocked any junta from ever finding the front entrance (""Door One"" in PR Talk).

"My wife and I take issue with ""Snooze"" as a clue to the noun BORE at 28D. It would have been better if it was ""Snoozer"".

"I like Sunday themelesses the way they do it at the Times, spreading it out so there are just a handful in a year.  They are particular, too, about who makes them.  Someone who would know told me a couple of years ago that they were by invitation only.  And I‚Äôve adored every one I‚Äôve done.  So, I‚Äôve been won over on that score.

And this one, man, so quirky!  Areas that filled in quickly.  Areas I had to chisel at.  Arts answers, science answers, the U-verse area (MULCTS, CALUMNY, JUNTA, TRUMAN, HURON), wackadoodles like CRIKEY and RIFFLES, lovely conversational answers like WHAT ELSE IS NEW, balanced by the more rarefied ones, such as CARL ORFF, HESSE, and TRANSFERRAL.  

Plus, skill woven in.  The gorgeous Patrick Berry grid design, coming in at 126 words, when the usual Sunday has 140, and yet so cleanly filled in.  Clever cluing, such as [Walk in place?] for FRONT ENTRANCE and [Month that goes by fast] for RAMADAN.  Freshness from 12 NYT debut answers, including REMIND ME AGAIN, WACKADOODLE, ALOO GOBI, and FIRST DEGREE.

Without a theme to constrain the non-theme squares, the constructor has a larger palette to draw from, and Tracy created a grab bag that certainly grabbed me; it felt to me like a work of crossword art, like I was being led through a secret world of treasures and delights.  I‚Äôd like to give it a year, then do it again.  Then return a year after that.

Thank you, Tracy.  More, please.  Brava!",48,positive,0.9173884987831116

"What a workout, but no look-ups required, and that's the hallmark of a clever, complex, fair puzzle. Some especially fun and tricky clues:  Walk in place? (ENTRANCE); Month that goes by fast? (RAMADAN), and TONNES of others.  ABLEISM was, and is, a mystery‚Äînever heard of it before and was surprised not to have to go back and clean up the SW corner‚Äîand I forgot that 
DOuSE is more or less the opposite of DOWSE, and stumbled on that until WACKADOODLE knocked some sense into me. That was the beauty of the puzzle: the difficult, obscure fills were always clear from the crosses.

Yesterday's puzzle was a frolic and came in well under my average, so for those who found this puzzle BOREing, well, my wheelhouse must be different from yours and I thought it was challenging, CRIKEY, I had a lovely time solving it.

Thank you, Tracy Bennett.  Well done.",27,positive,0.8864903450012207
"I do these puzzles with a pencil and a printed copy. The grid, with all of that white space, made it look particularly challenging. I used my eraser much more than usual this time, but finished in about my usual time. Excellent puzzle, though I'm not convinced that EONIAN is a word that anyone would use.

I thought that we were done with the kids' sore spots (44A), but I guess not. Filling those squares helped me get 44D, where my initial thought had been ""tithes"".",6,positive,0.6811668872833252

"From ‚ÄúDecember at Yase‚Äù (Gary SNYDER)

Only in dream, like this dawn,   
Does the grave, awed intensity   
Of our young love
Return to my mind, to my flesh.

We had what the others   
All crave and seek for;
We left it behind at nineteen.

I feel ancient, as though I had   
Lived many lives.

And may never now know   
If I am a fool
Or have done what my   
       karma demands.

I just looked up that poem this morning (along with his other poems to Robin), because I‚Äôve always held it dear since first reading it when I was about nineteen.  Sentimental, yes, awkwardly phrased, maybe, but it never fails to transport me back in time.

This puzzle had just enough bite to keep me fully engaged.  I loved CALUMNY, MULCTS, RATINE for their SAT-wordiness, and so much of the fill was colorful but in an understated way:  RED CEDAR, ALOO GOBI, TAKE A POWDER, WHAT ELSE IS NEW, ISOGONAL, TRANSFERRAL, even WACKADOODLE.  There was definitely a voice behind this puzzle - smart, learned, playful.  Definitely worthy of a Sunday themeless, imo.",38,neutral,0.7007701992988586

Boo.

I was perfectly happy the many years this was not a thing.  I didn't like it the first time they sprung one on us, and I haven't grown to like it ever since.  And if the column is correct, this has been going on since at least 2018.

Sloggish.  That's why when the kitchen-table-sized puzzle comes out shortly, I will studiously ignore it.  (That and the fact that I would have to hunt down and buy an actual paper.)  I did the first and said to myself, well, that's an hour (or whatever it was) of my life I'll never get back.
