"I'm happy to have finished this very nice Saturday puzzle.    Grateful for the forum to wind down with the comments.   Had a few lookups, I had Basque for Bilboa instead of Biscay. But found the corner not so bad once I corrected that. ""The eye"" totally baffled me and held me hostage in that NW corner trying to find my crossing mistake. Ironically, I just couldn't see it until I aha'd it.  I had to correct many of my incorrect first fills.  The wordplay was genius and above the norm. (Maybe not for a Saturday.)  In any case I got baby boomer immediately. I learned about an Indigenous people I didn't know, and a philosophical question I couldn't answer, so it was a good day! Cheers from an oldie from Texas. Stay chilled y'all!

1D clue (Bilbao being capital of BISCAY) put me in mind of a Kurt Weill/ Bertolt Brecht song, it's not my favorite song of theirs or anything but here's a fun version on stage with our favorite Toon/ mad-scientist inventor/ taxi-driver in the lead.

"I liked this puzzle, it's kind of a tribute to the Constructor when it's so tough that you think you won't finish & yet you never really resent it or think it unfair or Naticky or whatnot.

Really thought I might not finish but just kept going at it, sometimes noticing corners I hadn't revisited & filled in once I saw the good crosses.

Very good job of construction. Some nice long entries but mostly I loved the tricky but fair clues: Reward for staying, About to get it, Supreme leader? (got right away after a brief beat, hey I grew up in Motown), Place to pick up a puppy, etc‚Ä¶ w/the occasional TREAT tossed to us w/o having to beg to earn it (Arthur of Maude BEA) just to have a gimme or two. Also liked PROTIP, Academic extension‚Ä¶ clues were all good (well, except maybe 27D‚Äî ""A Brit in New York, maybe"" mighta hinted better at the whole brevity thing‚Ä¶), & plenty of other clues had so many quantum possibilities but once you got it it was a satisfied ""Ah Yes"" not a WTF.  42A was the last‚óº for me, I had hEROS, and when I got it I was ready to shake my fist at the sky like Capt Kirk but yelling SIRROOOOIIS!

"On a terrible Tuesday a couple of weeks ago, I was stymied by a cross between BELA Fleck, banjoist, and LENAPE, indigenous people of the Delaware valley.

I got uncharacteristically (I hope) snippy (in my defense, I was having problems getting my Prozac prescription filled) about how well-known the Lenape people were.  

There was a huge divide, with people in the Northeast finding it very easy, and people from other parts of the country utterly stumped.

In one diatribe, I asked how many people knew about indigenous people of other parts of the country, and one of the ones I mentioned were the NEZ PERCE people, which I had read about in ""Undaunted Courage"" by Steven Ambrose about the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

So I find it mildly odd and a little disquieting that the Nez Perce show up in this puzzle.  And I *still* couldn't quite get it, needing some crosses to help.",6,negative,0.7720349431037903
"""From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever."" Chief Joseph 

Watching a documentary of the Nez Perce in high school history class some 40 years ago has deeply affected me and my understanding of U.S. history ever since.  Needless to say, I suppose, and not in a good way. 

But I shall not belabor the point here. It was good to see the Nez Perce represented! And it made me think a rewatching of the movie might be in order. 

As for the puzzle as a whole, I loved it! 

As I approach one full year of doing the puzzles next month, this is now my second Saturday with absolutely no helps and in above average time, so that has me happy!  That was my goal for within a year. 

And that's not to say that I found this one easy, because I didn't. The south came pretty easily for me but sections of the north were pretty darn difficult with lots of deletes and rewrites. And occasionally rewriting some of my deletes. But I can see myself being a lot more flexible of mind and quicker to release what isn't serving me at the moment, as I go on--and that is helping me. 

Favorite clue was, ""Supreme leader"" for Ross!  Better yet, I got it on the very first pass! Huzzah!

I'm always surprised by the arcane answers that my mind dredges up as I tackle a puzzle like this one. NEZ PERCE and THESEUS were today's. Don't ask me where they've been hiding or why they popped up so easily.  The NW corner would have been easier if COREYS and ALMA had done it too. Still, speed solving isn't my goal.

Thank goodness for a few initial toeholds today! As a UX designer, 18A couldn't be fat-fingered in fast enough, so then FLU was a given, too. I have to thank a grad school classmate, who did her thesis project around the Hangul writing system -- plus I already had the COREYS, because duh! At some point in the 90's you couldn't escape them in movies and tabloids. I also had the ON ICE part of 16A, even if at midnight last night I couldn't remember the intro-! 

And then wow, some extra level (black diamond) cluing throughout! Looking back up from the bottom of the run, answers like UNTOLD, IN HOT WATER and OVERDONE seem so straightforward -- but I know there was some steep terrain there!

I thought one cheat on the absolutely impossible-for-me NW section would spring it open and I looked up BISCAY.  Nope-- not good enough. NO CAN DO. I had to look up the COREYS too.  So two cheats to finish.

One problem:  I had been looking for ICE CAPADES at 17A and I knew that if ICE didn't go at the beginning, it would have to go at the end.  But cEnT instead of SECT for the ""small denomination"" kept me from seeing STARS ON ICE.

Based on crosses, I have GARAENED at 14D.  I have no idea what it is and I don't like it at all.  I assume it's yet again another pot-smoking term that I, who does not smoke pot, is unfamiliar with.

In his first puzzle last November, a Monday, his four theme answers were two-word phrases, both words starting with B, such as BEAN BURRITO.  The revealer was TO BE FAIR, meant to be read aloud.  Hah!

Today, the play abounded in the clues.  I marked eight wordplay clues that struck my fancy ‚Äì eight! ‚Äì such as the stellar question mark clues [Beat poet?] for RAPPER, and [Horses around?] for CAROUSEL.

This was a TWO SPEED solve for me.  Most of it was fairly steady, but with enough delicious resistance to keep me well engaged. But then there was one area like a block of ice that I had to keep chipping away at, where I kept coming back with futile results, where it laughed at and mocked me for my incompetence, until finally, finally, I cracked it open, happy and grateful. 

Three reactions.  First, much to my amazement, BUCKET LIST has never appeared before in the NYT puzzle!  Second, the black squares dominating the center of the grid look like a giant S, and even though it‚Äôs backward, I couldn‚Äôt help but think of Superman.

Great Saturday puzzle.  What was impossible yesterday at 10 pm was entirely doable at 5am today.,33,positive,0.9784301519393921
"The many options in the NW made that section the trickiest for me.  EbaY, or ETSY, one SPEED or TWO SPEED, poinT or TREAT, cEnT or SECT?  So many choices!  It finally came down to one letter.  Is it mOREYS or COREYS, BISmAY or BISCAY?  My gut says BISCAY.  Yay!

A lot of great clues.  [Supreme leader?] for ROSS, [Horses around?] for CAROUSEL and [Characters in ""300""] for ZEROS were favorites.  Nice job, Ricky!",29,positive,0.48604220151901245

"I‚Äôm going to give myself a break and say that today‚Äôs grid was particularly US centric. (Put the pitchforks down, of course it‚Äôs a US publication and has every right to be US based. Just giving myself an out). That was one of the toughest grids I‚Äôve attempted for a long time. 
Total unknowns/impossible from the crosses for me: 46D, 34D, 16A, 61A 63A. Phew. Left a whole chunk of wide open space, tumbleweeds skittering through. 
Didn‚Äôt help that, like others, I went for high bridge,Marty and icecapades right at the top, which totally messed up that corner.

A few rare gimmes at GUETTA, ROSS, BABYBOOMER and BICS, stopped me from throwing the towel in early. But I needed all the help I could get from Caitlin and the commentariat. Thanks guys.

Looking at the finally filled grid I can appreciate the elegance of the spans and the work that‚Äôs gone into producing it. It‚Äôs left me with a headache for the day, but nobody said crossword solving was easy. It has to be earned.",11,negative,0.5320314764976501

"A friend of mine went on a kick the bucket tour, seeing old friends he thought unlikely to be with us much longer. I was happy to be excluded.

Nearby Joseph is named after their chief.

"Z! I have a feeling that this will be a common refrain for today's puzzle. 

Double checking every entry didn't help me find my one mistake because I had no clue about the name of the [Indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest] and hEROS seemed perfectly correct for 42A. It was only when I finally used Google to double-check the spelling of NEhPERCE that I was shown my missing Z.

I was particularly perturbed at myself because my original thought about 42A was that it was a reference to the number and not the film, but I eventually forgot my first impression. Rats.

Still proud that I (almost) got it!",11,neutral,0.5694169402122498

"Thanks, Ms Lovinger, for mentioning the Theseus. I had never heard of it until about a year ago, when Deb Amlen or one of the commenters referred to it. Of course, I didn‚Äôt remember it tonight, and got most of it from the crosses. 

The puzzle felt like it had a lot of answers that we don‚Äôt often see, which I enjoyed. I was surprised to get David GUETTA from just a few letters, since I don‚Äôt listen to much dance music. I wish I hadn‚Äôt needed as many letters as I did to get NEZ PERCE, but I think I had always assumed that tribe was from what‚Äôs now Montana or Idaho, neither of which fit my idea of the Pacific Northwest. 

Thanks, Mr. Sirois!",18,positive,0.568541944026947
"Love some of the visuals in this grid, like the unusual repetitiveness of double letters in the bottom stack:

BABYBOOMER
STREETTACO
THATTRACKS

And seriously, when a boomer gets the munchies (antojito) , what do they really want? A street taco. That totally tracks.

Similarly,

THEEYE
  EXXON

has something elegant about it, THEEYE looks like two obsolete forms of ""you"" smooshed together. What's good enough for thee is also good enough for ye.  And there is a real paucity of dos-equis words. Maybe EX-XYLOPHONIST. 

It doesn't surprise me that this puzzlemaker regards Gerard Butler's Leonidas and the rest of the OVERDONE cast of moody Spartans as ZEROS, not HEROS (or WINOS, my first choice). I do, too. And to those who say David Wenham and Lena Headey were excellent, and that I should revise my rating, I would reply, ""No can do: guetta life!""

TIL that my bucket list includes dumping a bucket of hot water on the Stars on Ice. Not too hot, mind you, I wouldn't want an OVERDONE Brian Boitano or Apolo Ohno, just enough to make them hoppin' mad. I'd better map out a plan to evade them, otherwise I'll land on my spine and find myself rather pleated from the pro tips of their skates. That tracks. Now that I've thought it over, it's no longer on my bucket list.  Or put it on the list below the one where some of the people in the news these days get entombed -- natural causes, picnic-lightning -- ere long, one by one, gardened over.

"The reference in 17A to STARS ON ICE reminded me of an episode of ""Frasier"" in which Martin (Frasier's dad) wants to take him to see a show called ""Chimps on Ice.""  (Frasier wants to stay home and watch a Mozart opera on TV). A bit of dialog from that episode:

Martin:  Duke said, in the finale the whole cast skates to the top of this ramp, and then splat! Right into a tank of whipped cream. Bet they don't do that at your opera.
