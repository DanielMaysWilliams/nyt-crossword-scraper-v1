"Really enjoyable puzzle

Got stuck for a little due to having TRAGICSTORIES instead of ORIGINSTORIES",7,positive,0.4548884630203247
"I had a smooth, quick solving experience until I got stuck in the SW. I pulled PLINKO out of some recess of my brain, only to follow it with sPoON—which I was sure was right until it wasn’t. I have heard the term PLUGS for those unappealing-to-me adornments, but “gauge earrings” meant nothing. 

Thanks for a proper Friday challenge, y’all!",13,neutral,0.5636398196220398
"The clue ""Still working on it?"" solves to ALL DONE not because that's how someone who leaves food on their plate would respond to the question, but because it's another way of *asking* the question (""All done?""). By contrast, NOT DONE doesn't work because it's not synonymous with the clue.",15,neutral,0.7840200066566467
"Fast and fun. I may have been distracted a bit because we have a beautiful, tiny nest in one of our hanging baskets, and every morning there is another tiny egg in it. We’re up to four. We hardly ever see the mama.

I commissioned one of the teens to figure out how to order and set up a cam, and was met with a blizzard of technical questions. “That’s all up to you! I just want some pictures of those baby birds hatching!”",10,positive,0.7995894551277161
"A miracle of construction that didn't require any look-ups despite all those unknown names, so I had to smooth my ruffled feathers and admit that the crosses took me where I needed to go and names dropped in all by themselves. Just some outside-of-the-outside-of-the-outside-of-the-box thinking, plus SCADS of luck, and hey, easy does it — I was DONE.  

Matthew Stock and Christina Iverson, I suspect there was a lot of grinning, chuckling and outright laughing as you cooked up this puzzle, and this solver was delighted to join in.  Thanks for the fun.",31,positive,0.768303632736206
"Will anyone be wearing a SKELETON COSTUME to the MET GALA? We'll find out in 10 days or so.  
Excellent job all around on a Friday puzzle, Christina and Matthew.",22,positive,0.7445952892303467
"I once dated an octopus but she broke it off. ""You're too handsy,"" she said. ""Don't worry, I'll grow out of this."" 

She really made no bones about it.

"A snapper of a grid, nicely balanced with spanners and near-spanners that resonated with each other, superheroes and antiheroes, the innocence of a long ago childhood of tin can phones, poring over comic books, dressing up in a skeleton costume, snapping turtles for pets -- a nono in our house -- fondue parties, playing plinko, bored in school, can't wait for the bell, giggling with your friends over the fun fact that the Grand Tetons were thus named by a sexually imaginative French explorer and who knew birds' names could be such a hoot? 

And then, adulthood, tense and full of hard work and serious things like salons and tailors, mail-in ballots, dull jobs as clerks, helpers, having to come up with stopgap measures to fix the insoluble problems handed down by the top dogs, who are so full of it that it's like having Homer Simpson as your boss. Doh! 

No wonder you end up in Rosa's Cantina, 
where the music would play and Felina would whirl, 
and then off to El Gordo's for tacos with crema, 
served by a man with gauge earrings and pearls.",41,positive,0.7796325087547302
"Oy.  Did anyone skim the Wordplay column?  ""Tin Can Alley""??  Seriously man, neither you nor your wife realized your mistake before this hit print?  So embarrassing.  Didn't pan out.

Th puzzle was fine.  Wasn't fond of the geography cross with Benin, but it was okay overall.",6,negative,0.8711969256401062
"Leave it to Matthew Stock and Christina Iverson to bring us a puzzle that's chewy, intelligent, and not at all FULL OF IT.

Speeding letters into squares, then stalling and staring, speed-stall-stare-speed-stall-stare made for lots of exciting thinking, pondering, and ahas.

Thank you for this perfect Friday puzzle.

Loved it!",28,positive,0.8565663695335388
Nice puzzle with fresh fill. totally devoid of stale crosswordese. Kudos to the constructors.,40,positive,0.9517322182655334
"Liked it quite a bit.

RUDDERS, BELAYS, LEIF The Lucky?! and CLERK all seemed ingenious and well written.

The 4 spanning Across clues were also good.

Thank you, may I have another.",47,positive,0.9569840431213379

"This is a proper Friday puzzle. Long periods of staring at the grid followed by a breakthrough (usually a long answer) and a flurry of adjacent words - then back to staring again, etc.",74,neutral,0.7352521419525146
"Excellent puzzle. Tough but fair. I was desperately convinced that ""Cruise control features?"" implied a movie produced by Tom Cruise. Didn't get it until the very end. Didn't help that I had sPoONS as my crossing. 

If I hadn't had empanadas with CREMA at dinner tonight, that likely would have eluded me too.

On tougher puzzles, I often find myself at the beginning of the end starting to solve clues like I solve Wordle. Just start placing letters against each other in a way that's pronounceable until I get a real word. That was a helpful strategy today",19,positive,0.5671418309211731
"This was another of those puzzles that initially seemed impossible, but which actually came together pretty quickly.  This (for me at least) happens frequently in puzzles with a lot of long acrosses.  Usually once one of those falls into place the downs become obvious, and the whole puzzle opens up.  All the grid spanners in this one were fun and fresh.  I especially liked SKELETONCOSTUME, which only came to me after forcing myself to accept that skeleton crew was never going to fit.",21,positive,0.900066077709198

Solid puzzle.  Only took me fifteen minutes but the top half had some tricky entries.  Very enjoyable solve.,11,positive,0.9718376398086548
