"This was really hard for me at first because I thought it was going to be really hard. On the first go-through, I had pretty much nothing because I was SO sure I was missing the trick.  Then I read the non-spoiler parts of Deb's column and saw she was saying it wasn't hard, so I went through it again and NAILED IT with a personal best for Thursdayâ€”by a good bit. Hmm! 

I really didn't think the theme clues would be that straightforward for me (and I only speak for myself, of course). I saw that someone (Lewis, I think? Apologies if I'm wrong there) posted what the original text clues were to be, which was interesting. They sure would have made this much trickier for me. Though the drawings are definitely cute and the puzzle was fun. 

I loved the TEA SHOP at 1D once I got there. I definitely thought of raked leaves first. I had TIP, so I thought of TraSH... something, so with only two squares left, still thinking it would be hard, I wondered if it were a rebus. (The other kind.)  

Anyhow, I also loved the clue for ETC at 33D. That had me going for awhile! MELROSE at 42D was great, though I never watched an episode in my life. 

I could go for a SAMOSA right now... I love them with the green chutney, which I would probably eat like soup if left to my own devices. So good!",8,neutral,0.4099753797054291

I'm not sure how everyone else found this to be easy--pretty challenging for me. Felt like a Thursday for sure. Am I the only one?,20,negative,0.6292057633399963

And, as usual... late answer search and puzzle find. Two letter count answers that dawned on me today:

15 letters - CROSSWORDPUZZLE (been an answer in 24 puzzles)*

21 letters - SUNDAYCROSSWORDPUZZLE - never been in a puzzle and not even in the Xword Info lists. Though TODAYSCROSSWORDPUZZLE was an answer in a Sunday puzzle from April 13, 2003.  

*In one of those puzzles, it was one of four 15 letter theme answers. In order, those were:

DUETOBUDGETCUTS
THENEWYORKTIMES
CROSSWORDPUZZLE
WILLENDTOMORROW

The date of that puzzle? 

April 1, 2016.
