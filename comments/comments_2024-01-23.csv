"The Elements of Style was a guiding light for so many writers, both the traditional and the way out there, with clear explanations for why to do what with words.  No pedantry, just clarification.

Poetry has been the background music of my life for as long as I can remember, but certainly from when I first started memorizing verses in elementary school.  Sometimes the words are enrichment, sometimes solace, sometimes encouragement, sometimes a warning, but almost always welcome. Yeats over Poe, but all it is worth having.",0,positive,0.77894526720047

We all had egg creams and they were amazing. Bonus fun fact, Holsten's is where the famous final scene of ""The Sopranos"" takes place. We even got to sit in their booth! We ordered onion rings in Tony's honor and they were a perfect accompaniment to the egg creams. I recommend this road trip.

"13-year-old me, along wirh the rest of my seventh-grade English class, got an assignment: memorize a poem, and then recite it in front of the class.

Now, most of the boys in the class figured out   a way to fufill the requirement: memorize these lines...actually a small part of a larger poem, but presented as a complete poem...slouch up to the podium, drone this out:

""Your little hands,
Your little feet,
Your little mouth —
Oh, God, how sweet!""

...and plop back down at the desk.

But not me. Oh, no. I was a Poe fan, and I was going to do this right. So I memorized ""The Bells."" The whole...damned...thing. And I walked up, stood at the podium and remembered: Oh yeah...I'm an acne-covered 13-year-old with paralyzing stage fright.

By th time I got towards the end, and my final repetition of

""of the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells,
of the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells.. ""

there were several kids with their heads on their desks, moaning loudly.

"A second post allows me to expand upon MOOG:

In these days when a cheap electronic keyboard can be purchased for pennies at any toy store, it's hard to understand how revolutionary Robert Moog and his instruments were. Until then, synthesizers were huge, expensive items, which relied upon vacuum tubes and punch cards for input, and affordable by electronic music studios of only the most well-heeled academic institutions. With the release of his first synthesizer in 1964, Moog created an insrument of manageable size, and dropped the price to one-tenth. Also, I believe it was the first synthesizer with a piano-style keyboard interface. But the real breakthrough came in 1970, with the release of the Minimoog, which was portable, and cost a mere $1600--expensive in 1970, but not prohibitively so.

I see that Moog, who began his career building theremins and was interviewed in the 1994 documentary *Theremin: an Electronic Odyssey*, is the subject of his own 2004 documentary. It's posted, in its entirety, on Youtube; I shall have to watch it tonight.
 
Minimoogs, Yamaha DS-7s: models of those early synthesizers from the 70's and 80's, still in playable condition, have become widely sought after by collectors and performers in tribute bands--Historically Informed Performance practice, HIP-HIP-hooray!

It's been an answer 35 times, but... NEVER in a pre-Shortz puzzle. And even MLKJR (tough string of letters) has been an answer 3 times - again, all in the Shortz era. 

So... wondered if there was an avoidance of intialisms in pre-Shortz puzzles so checked on JFK. Well - 22 times in Shortz era puzzles and... only twice in pre-Shortz puzzles. 

So... furrowed brow. Not sure what to think.

"Random thoughts:

• How do you pronounce MOOG – does it start with the cow sound or does it rhyme with “vogue”?  The latter, it turns out, according to Robert Moog himself.
• I like LOGO BRAVO IWO, and try saying that fast a number of times.
• Lovely long downs EGG CREAM and THE BELLS!
• Spent a few moments shaking my head in awe of this theme, where Patrick thought of ELEMENTS OF STYLE in the first place, then made the leap to coming up with in-the-language answers that combined chemical elements with articles of clothing.  Bravo, sir!
• I like the theme echoes of CLOAK and PANTS.
• G’day!  Just to let those who don’t know that there’s a sizeable city near GDANSK that starts with the same two letters – Gdynia, which hosts the Polish Film Festival, and in 2013 was voted Poland’s best city to live in.
• I love the balancing PuzzPair© of DAH and NAE NAE.

Here are some other pieces of good advice from it:

“A single overstatement, wherever or however it occurs, diminishes the whole, and a carefree superlative has the power to destroy, for the reader, the object of the writer's enthusiasm.”

“Writers will often find themselves steering by stars that are disturbingly in motion.”

“To achieve style, begin by affecting none.”

"I quick puzzle that somehow avoided tired old fillers and had a confident air that we were going to enjoy it.  This one had real ELEMENTS OF STYLE, no TINFOIL HAT protection needed.

A chic debut indeed, Patrick Maher.  Thank you!",13,positive,0.9484661221504211

Really enjoyable, thank you!
I got Gdansk straightaway.
The delivery driver got me though haha. Very clever.",11,positive,0.9810845851898193
"I just got around to the monthly bonus puzzle and missed* that it wasn't a Fred Piscop construction.  Anybody know if he's going to be doing the bonus puzzle again?  They were always well constructed with many topical answers and little junk fill.

There's an interesting article about Fred here:

*For the first time I abandoned this month's bonus at about 80% complete as it had too much junk fill for my taste.",5,neutral,0.5476769804954529
"ELEMENTS OF STYLE was a hilarious revealer!

It makes me want to put on my NEON VEST with the SILVER LINING!

Not to mention my (imaginary) TUNGSTEN TIARA and PLATINUM PETTICOAT.",40,positive,0.9690937399864197
"Loved it! Wonderful revealer and theme. Super speedy, and good fun! Welcome to the NYT Crossword!",14,positive,0.9908230304718018
"How is anyone here 
except for one person 
actually expected 
to know GDANSK?  

(J/K!)

I hope another poster
will not be too upset
about ""Chowder morsel.""

The style answers alone
would have Strunk,
bit adding the elements
made it quite White.

Fine debut, Patrick!",22,neutral,0.6206837296485901
