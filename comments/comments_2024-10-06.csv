"I would argue that terms and conditions are not synonyms (yep, I'm a lawyer).  For those of you who have insomnia, I'm now going to provide the cure.
In legalese, terms are things that are defined.  By way of example, terms describe the parties to a contract, the subject of the contract (a piece of real estate), expected performance (I will buy your real estate), etc.  
Conditions act on terms.  Time is a term (I will buy your real estate in three weeks).  Requirements are a term (I will buy your real estate if it passes inspection).  Enforcement is a term (if you don't buy the real estate in three weeks, I can sue you).

"For 78D I think I can give a bit of insight via Kevin Stroud's excellent History of English podcast. I'll summarize what I understand from multiple nuggets in multiple episodes...
Because of the dominance of the Norman French in England for centuries during the usage of Old English and development of Middle English, for a long time French was the language of law and government. During the Hundred Years War, however, English regained its place of pride in England. What ended up developing in our language was a lot of phrases consisting of [synonym 1] and [synonym 2], where one of the words was derived from a French root and the other was derived from a Germanic root. (Law and order, facts and figures, etc). This reflected the institutional memory of French dominance, as well as the renewed importance of English (and, in turn, its Nordic Germanic roots). Often, we end up with words that are actually distant-cousin versions of cognates -- derived from the same Proto Indo European root word, but having traveled through different paths in Europe to arrive at seemingly completely different words.",5,neutral,0.6095889210700989

What I did on my Saturday vacation, or lets share the latest gnus from me tau you:

Would have slept in, but wanted to see Mia new bird.
My hon said ""snot your day to be idle, so upandatem, uncurl off those sheets,  pullyourselftogether and I'll start the coffee""

Well, JKugelman, I opened meine eyes, and added some dosh to the swearjar. As this is the NYT, will ixnay the crudeness from ""unpc slur"" to,  ""Dontstartwithme,"" as I slipped off my singlet and slipped into my Keds. Spotting migrating birds suites me fine, and we've sheena few lifers together.

Dontquotemeonthis, but after --- years of wedded bliss, have learned that allyouneedislove and - 
The spouse who opines with steel may face flames.
If you eatat oysterbars, any PDA is TMI.
A demonical nag will nap alone (noah what I mean, say no more)
Youcantwinthemall.

Anyhoo, the dawn chorus yielded bonanzas
 of birdsong from the Brown Eng, McCoo, Lesser Araby, Tufted Ouioui, Redsun, and Rim Yap. 

Yours,
Madamex

"I didn't like this one.  Theme clues were WAY too long and chatty and not worth the desired effect.  I thought the whole thing was a pretty weak effort, ironically enough, considering the theme and grade.

Not to mention what I'm sure will drive many crazy, the presence of the same full words in both the answer and clue (me... two).

I'd have liked to see a better puzzle than this.  Oh well.  There are always past glories.

"If there's any crossword where nitpicking grammar is justified, it's surely this one - 92A is incorrect in both versions. Since the clue specifies girls as the addressees, it should be 'pull yourselves together', not just yourself. A teacher would mark the connection itself wrong.

There was no reason to add a plural noun to it, it could have just been correct! Good puzzle otherwise if a bit easy for a Sunday.",9,negative,0.6838682293891907
"Who else thought of the Simpsons after figuring out 18A?

My first instinct for 78D was ""eula"" as an example of something that could be considered ""terms and conditions"". Doesn't quite fit the terminology of the clue, but whatever. And I figured 82A was asking me to emphasize the ""draw"" but thought it was something you do at the end of a *draw*ing.

Also took me way too long to figure out 17D even with _E_S filled out.",3,neutral,0.7522263526916504

"Fun puzzle, lots of fun cluing, but far out the theme clues were hard in the app without the red markups you get in the PDF/paper versions (which I only found out about after the solve when I came here).

Would have been a lot more clear what the theme was, I spent far too long trying to figure out what the underline represented and only started to get the theme after I'd filled in more than 3/4 of the puzzle.

Sad I didn't get to experience the puzzle the way it was intended but an interesting solve nonetheless üòä",5,positive,0.7781732678413391

"Marilyn McCoo.

What a beauty!  What a beautiful voice!

I was in high school and ""Wedding Bell Blues"" was on the juke box, and played frequently.

""Wedding Bell Blues"" was by the Fifth Dimension, with McCoo singing lead.  It was a love not to this guy ""Bill"", asking him to marry her.

The only problem was that at the time I was really, really in love with a girl, and I suspected she was being courted by a guy named Bill.

It took me a long, *long* time to finally be able to enjoy the song.

This is quite the corny presentation, but it demos how beautiful she was/is in so many ways.

"To answer Sam‚Äôs question about things like ‚Äúterms and conditions‚Äù which are known as legal doublets:

The doubling‚Äîand sometimes even tripling‚Äîoften originates in the transition from use of one language for legal purposes to another: in Britain, from a native English term to a Latin or Law French term; in Romance-speaking countries, from Latin to the vernacular. To ensure understanding, the terms from both languages were used. This reflected the interactions between Germanic and Roman law following the decline of the Roman Empire. These phrases are often pleonasms[1] and form irreversible binomials.
