"The emotional roller-coaster I went through while solving 123A [Home to eight of the 10 fastest-growing US cities]:

Dread: ugh, it's seven letters... please say it's not so...

Hope: there are other seven-letter states that  could be experiencing growth, Arizona, New York...

Relief:  solved 120D, which is a no-brainer, so the first letter of 123A is definitely not F 

Dismay: filled in enough crossings to have to accept that 123A is SUN BELT, which does indeed include my overcrowded, overpriced home state üò≠üò≠üò≠

Being a Northerner I was raised on RUGBY League; we lived a half mile away from Bradford Northern‚Äôs (now Bulls) ground so I went to every home game with Dad from around age 7. The Northern clubs broke away from the Union I think in the 1920s over whether  to pay players or not; the North said yes, the southern Union no. Union has dominated the sport since, but is considered by us Northerners as a ‚Äòsofter‚Äô game as they have more players (15 to our 13), therefore less ground to cover. There are other differences but it‚Äôs basically the same game.
Both types are brutal compared to your US style of football. There are no pads or protection other than a skull cap if the player has prominent ears (stops them being used as ‚Äòholds‚Äô). I still recall watching a game in 1972 when I was 12 when one of our chaps took a flying tackle that flung him in the air.

A trick clue should be able to be solved with enough crosses. There is no ‚Äúgive away‚Äù clue inside the puzzle. And the title the ‚ÄúAyes‚Äù is insufficient. 

I have now completed over a thousand puzzles at this point.  I believe that the issue in this puzzle is an editorial issue, not a constructor issue.",1,positive,0.517362654209137
"Draymond Green is incredible. Power forward, center, point guard. Perennial DPOY candidate.  Truly one of the best TWEENERS in the game. 

Except. No one has ever said that, ever, and might get beat up if they did. Kidding - but not really. TWEENERS is not a term thats been used in the forty years I‚Äôve been around the game of basketball.

A TWEEN is a 10-12 year old child. It might have been more of a gimme, but I would have gone in that direction with the clue. 

Fun puzzle. Picked up on the theme early on and battled through. Finished quite a bit under average.

Thanks, Joe Deeney",10,positive,0.8313719034194946
"Funny, this one, such kooky themers, each one more wonderfully shambolic than the last. Have you noticed how everything is ""shambolic"" these days? Campaigns, events, books, radio shows, entire teams (am I right, White Sox? If we're calling you shambolic I've never known a team to EARN IT as much as you guys!). Anyway, unlike the White Sox, this one worked precisely because the fill was of the CORNIER shambolic variety: it made me snort a few times. And don't forget, people, I warned you very recently about the dread ANAPEST!

We were born before the wind
Also, younger than the sun
'Ere the bonnie boat was won
As we sailed into the mystic
Hark now, hear the sailors cry
Smell the sea and feel the sky
Let your soul and spirit fly
Into the mystic
Yeah, when that fog horn blows
I will be coming home
Yeah, when that fog horn blows
I wanna hear it
I don't have to fear it
And I wanna rock your gypsy soul
Just like way back in the days of old
Then magnificently we will float
Into the mystic...

It's one of the most beautiful of Van Morrison's songs, and when he gets it right, it can uplift me into a temporary little magic place, a good one, one I wish would last a bit longer every time. No LSD needed, Bill W. Listen to this one from 1979:

"Nice workout!

I was a little concerned about 45 minutes in.  A lot of white and a lot of unconvincingly filled squares.

When I finally got the theme, it made my theme entries make sense, but not before.

Nice fake out with the Everglades.  Finally dumped gatorS for EGRETS.

And I always have to refigure out what it is about cocoa, or cacao, that I can never get the spelling right?  I think there are things going on in the world that I know nothing about.  Someone's not telling me something.",10,neutral,0.4286067485809326

"Today is my day to be confused.

What's the deal with 30A [Small square]

DOH!

Like always, I see it as I'm in the act of asking.  Squares are the numbers 4, 9, 16... the smallest is one.

Although Terence Howard swears to me that 1 times 1 is two.

So that can't be right.",9,neutral,0.5354408025741577

"Like Caitlin, I wasn't acquainted with the sense of 31A (TWEENERS) as used in the clue.  Instead, the definition of tweener as ""a shot in racket sports that is performed by hitting the ball between the legs"" is more familiar to me.

Here's one of the great tweener shots of all time, executed by Roger Federer in a semi-finals match at the US Open in 2009 (against a pretty decent opponent):

"Very fun.

Favorite: TIRADE IDEALS. This could apply to many areas of life, so why not Wordplay?

1) The tirade should contain some wittiness in addition to the subject of the tirade.
2) The tirade should be fun to read about, for people who might not be the experts in the tiraded subject.
3) The tirade should inspire interesting counterpoint from other commenters.
4) The tirade should not cast aspersions on constructors, editors, or columnists.
5) The tirade should keep the emus in mind, and strive for a tone that won‚Äôt anger them.
6) CORNIER STORIES could ideally be incorporated into a tirade.",46,positive,0.8313828706741333

"Our constructor notes:
     I hope everyone had fun solving this puzzle. Having a second Sunday puzzle published and completing a second Monday through Sunday cycle have been goals for quite some time, so this one is extra special to me.

Joe,
Lots of fun, thanks.  
Well done, and congrats
