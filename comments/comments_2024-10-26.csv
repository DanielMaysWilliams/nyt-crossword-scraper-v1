I left them for this morning and when they still didn't come to me I did one lookup and completed it.

It happened again the next year, 2005.

Bad impersonations was probably the best clue.  Trapp was a gimme.  The ones I liked least were ""big do"" (kind of awkward) and mink stole - I'd prefer to pretend that furs were no longer a thing.

And... that center triple stack is really impressive. Seems like it's been a while since I've seen one of those. I had actually noticed recently that it seemed like there were fewer grid-spanning entries in a lot of the puzzles. 

Anyway... just can't help but wonder how much of a workout it must be to come up with three 15 letter stacked entries and place them so that they're all workable with the down crosses. And in this puzzle that stack is crossed with a number of 9 and 10 letter entries. That's pretty amazing. 

I'll shut up now. Nice puzzle.

"I'm surprised some found this easy.  I had only a few gimmes (STANLEYCUP, MERYL, UBOAT and SHARK) and, as we all know by now, SHARK was wrong.  Some sharks do in fact have 'mermaid's purse' eggs but closely associated SKATEs (like sharks, they are not teleosts or bony fish) do too.  Shark and skate share that letter 'a' with the crossing U-Boat; and it was only when I remembered that (as a one-time sort-of marine biologist it should have come to me sooner) that the NE corner unlocked and so much else came tumbling into place.

I was certain that the 1954 medical breakthrough had to be polio vaccine but Salk's announcement was 1955; and as more and more crosses made it less and less likely I had to abandon that idea.",8,neutral,0.5540341734886169

"For me, this was just about right, with pieces falling just so satisfyingly into place. 

The NE and SE corners did get naticky for me with SANTE/MUST/SKATE and RANI/INNES/BIGDO. The NE seemed unnecessarily trivia laden when there are less obscure (but perhaps more clever) clues, and I‚Äôm not sure if I like making puzzle more fiddly for the sake of it.

I found this one quite enjoyable but with a few more naticks, I could see this tipping over the edge towards frustration.",10,positive,0.6775915622711182
