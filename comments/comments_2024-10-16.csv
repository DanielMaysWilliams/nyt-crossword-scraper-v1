"My intermediate Spanish and beginner French knowledge have helped me a great deal in solving NYT crosswords! Columnist Sam might be interested to know that I began studying French on Duolingo with the specific intention of emigrating to Canada. Alas, that is now unlikely to happen, but the daily practice is still good for keeping my middle-aged brain limber.

I get it.  It's something fun to pick nits.

But my question is, was anyone really unable to solve the puzzle because of these?  Did [Neuter] really prevent anyone from solving it as SLAY?

Because if it did, I must be doing the puzzles wrong.  I often don't even notice some of them because I fill the last letter in from a cross, and never check it except maybe for spelling sense.",7,negative,0.47586530447006226

One tiniest of gripes (I normally wouldn't take umbrage at this but this is after all the best place for minute word nitpicks), but the clue for 23A should be [Li'l], with the apostrophe after the 'i' rather than before.

Nor was it.  Here are some other answers needlessly clued by testing one's knowledge of pop culture:  PLANE (67A); PURGE (15A); ESS (65A).  Look, there are always names in the grid that can't be avoided in the cluing, but to go out actively looking for them... I don't know why some constructors think it's going to be a big thrill for solvers to cough up this mindless ephemera.

Oh, yes, the theme.  Even though I don't know Spanish, I know enough to have had no trouble with the theme at all.  I liked it and thought it was cute. 

Better cluing choices could have made this a much better puzzle.  Maybe next time...",10,neutral,0.40516796708106995

"Coming up with this word list was just an act of genius, IMHO, and I loved this puzzle.  
Except for LOCO, which after all had long been included in our English language, these were, indeed, words learned in BEGINNER SPANISH--8th grade ""sub-freshman"" year, 1960-61.  

Speaking of included words in our language, today's Spelling Bee STILL excludes CONTINUO.  It's sad when MUSIC education is missing from someone's background.  But 'peplum' was fine the other day?

In 2010, when LeBron left CLEveland, people burned their jerseys.  Quite the turn-around n 2014.

"Two non-themers in this puzzle woke memories in me - one amusing, one profound.

I have a vivid imagination when reading or listening, such that images run through my mind immediately. So on the day 45 years ago when the passage from Revelation was read by the president of the Lutheran church where I was the organist, in his most stentorian tones, which was meant to be
“and I saw the wingèd creatures surrounding the throne, myriad upon myriad…”
but he actually said:
“mermaid upon mermaid…”
I busted out with a full-body guffaw at the image I saw in my head. Nobody else knew why I was laughing during a scripture reading.

When my life was fractured some 22 years ago, I went three months unable to speak. The daughter of a former colleague asked me to sing the Sheva Brachot (Seven Blessings) for her wedding, and that was the occasion of the return of my voice. Driving from New Haven to Buffalo, rehearsing the blessings over and over to be able to be part of life again. Those blessings were blessings for me.

I also loved the misdirection of having a clue “Li’l _____” rather than the more common “______ [insert name of rapper here]”.  Naturally I started trying the names of the various “Li’l” rappers I’ve learned about through crosswords, but couldn’t get any to fit.  I was delighted when, instead, the answer turned out to be ABNER.  That took me back to the sixties when one of my great joys in life was reading the Sunday funnies.  Li’l Abner had the place of honor at the top of the front comics page and I enjoyed his edgy  wit.

It was great fun and really helped my French-speaking, particularly as it related to the Catholic-related CURSE words used up there. I do remember there was some kind of funny phrase the kids used to say in French that sounded like they were speaking German.
