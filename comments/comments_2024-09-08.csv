"Really nice theme. Clever way of binding together so many well-known sayings.

Lost some time and wondered about my age when I stood by DAZZ as the ‚ÄúWhip it‚Äù band, when my wife clearly started singing ‚Äúwhip it good‚Äù‚Ä¶.only to sheepishly realize that ‚ÄúLet it Whip‚Äù was the Dazz Band‚Äôs big hit, not ‚ÄúWhip It‚Äù. Lost some credibility there.

Much better than last Sunday which did me in for a week. I finally finished it with lots of help yesterday and completed the weeks puzzles including Saturday. They were all just fine. So on to today with a great deal of initial trepidation. But I shouldn't have worried. This one was enjoyable and doable in one sitting.  My brain didn't melt down. There were some tricky clues.

"What I especially liked about this theme was that it had more depth than the usual (and wonderful) wordplay-only theme. This theme, involving the arc of our lives, elicited images, at least for me, from the movie reel of my own life, from my experiences and from observing others.

AMATEUR STANDING brought funny images of the little ones that have crossed my path.  DRIVING CRAZY whooshed me right back to high school days.  CENTENNIAL STATE got me to thinking about the few people I‚Äôve known or seen who have made it to that age.  And so on.

So, this was a solve that sandwiched in memories, crosswords as photo album; a rich experience.

The wordplay in the theme answers was lovely as well, each phrase suggesting the life stage, but normally used in a completely different context.    I especially liked the play of AMATEUR STANDING, BAR ADMISSION, FINISH THE JOB, and CENTENNIAL STATE.

Two other reactions.  One, my brain greatly enjoyed overcoming the barrier of not knowing seven proper names among the answers.  And two, BOUCHE ‚Äì oh, how beautiful French looks and sounds; this word, if it were American, would be spelled BOOSH.
