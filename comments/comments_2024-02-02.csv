"A late note on the Papal BULL. Many years ago at the age of ten or eleven I came across this term in my learning world history. 
In the mid sixteenth century, when the Spanish and Portuguese moved from exploration to exploitation they needed to have a decision on how to divide the world. They asked for a ruling from the Pope, nearest thing to the UN at that time. Since the Spanish had gone west, Columbus et al,  and the Portuguese East, daGama et al, a line was drawn down the Atlantic to the west of the Azores, which were already Portuguese, with each country taking the appropriate side.

My point, this was promulgated by what I learnt of as being ‚ÄúThe Papal Bull‚Äù.",2,neutral,0.9162574410438538

"As threatened again: Probably the strangest puzzle I have ever, ever encountered. A Sunday from August 19, 1979 by Ronald Friedman with the title ""Strip Tees."" (would note that this was his only puzzle in the Times).

The trick in the puzzle was simply to have answers with all of the T's omitted. As an example:

Clue ""Obsolete.""
Answer: OUOFDAE

So the implied answer would be OUTOFDATE

A couple of other examples of the ones that I at least figured out:

""Pagan"" : HEAHEN
""Bikini adjectives"" : ISYBISYEENYWEENY
...and one that took just a bit of pondering:

""Popular refrain"" : EAFORWOANDWOFOREA

And one that took MORE than a bit of pondering:
""Playground item"" : 
EEEROER

"Paul Bunyan FELLED many a tree and John Bunyan's ""Pilgrim's Progress"" felled many a reader: a 1950 survey of literary critics by  Columbia University Press crowned it ""The world's most boring book."" Whereas the Paul Bunyan book I had as a kid wowed me with its tales of the giant at his lumber camp, with a dozen cooks strapping whole slabs of bacon to their shoes and skating around a skillet the size of an ice arena to grease it up and make Paul Bunyan's enormous breakfast, which would have required many a hen to lay an egg. And let's not forget Babe the Blue Ox, Paul's faithful companion: it would have taken a lot of grub to fill the belly of THAT beast. I mean, those two ATE UP. 

And to the puzzle, loved those long crossing spanners!

I got it on crosses, and those top left niners were also tough.  I only got DR MARTENS because I'm aware that the brand exists.  The clue might just as well have been ""Footwear brand.""

For Solo act, I didn't think of cups, but I did try Han Solo, and after that, Napoleon Solo. However, I don't think of actors when I think of MONOLOGUE; to me, that's a soliloquy.  MONOLOGUEs are the province of comics and late-night hosts.

IN ECSTASY does mean ""Sky-high"", but it didn't come to mind without several crosses.  And it didn't help that one of them was ENMITY, when I had guessed ANIMUS.  And I'M DONE off just the Doc's D and the N of NATS was a fortunate guess.  Never heard of the Isle of ELY, although I have heard of Ron ELY, who played Tarzan a long time ago.

Elsewhere, I opted for ASTA where it was supposed to be TOTO, but TOGO put me right.  (And TOGO, too??)  

Of course, like probably everyone else (especially those who had the B from NBC already), John and Paul were BEATLES, not BUNYANS.  I wasn't familiar with John BUNYAN, and seems to me to be rather obscure.
