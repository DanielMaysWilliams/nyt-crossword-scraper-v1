As a self-avowed James Bond fan, both of the books and pre-Daniel Craig films, I found WALTHERPPK to be a gimme.

It's not that I don't like the Daniel Craig films. They are well done. However, I came out of the first one thinking, ""Well, now that was just an action-adventure film, not a James Bond film."" I have not reassessed that opinion, nor have I watched all the Craig films. I may do both at some point.

Lazenby was the best film Bond, the most Fleming, I think. I will note that my opinion may be colored by the fact that his ""Bond girl"" was my first love, Diana Rigg. 

Dalton is highly underrated as Bond. 

Perhaps, if he'd had been able to get out of his Remington Steele contract to take the role when it was originally offered him, Brosnan would have been excellent, but I find him the least watchable, although still entirely watchable, Bond.

Lots of little tiny epiphanies, lots of 'erasures', very satisfying. Especially when things started filling in bit by bit down the home stretch! With a lot still blank (or filled w/rebus-square ""alternate options"") & not proceeding apace, 26D (aha! EXTRAEXTRA) kinda led to the very very slow cascade of further fills.

I had ""Crazy"" for 27D Heartüé∂ for a while (""Crazy On You""), but glimpsed AWRY at 27A which cast the 'C' in doubt, lotsa subtle very Saturday clue/answer pairs like 34A Sauce/BOOZE (I had 'gravy', with a scowl, then 'BrOth', w/ a bigger scowl)‚Ä¶ 37A BORNE, etc etc. Crosses were nice & fair but also challenging, REEBOK dawned when BOOK seemed likely at 34D‚Ä¶ I really like 53A NOTCRICKET (check out Kinks' song ""Cricket"", one of my favorite songs ever, linked in my reply to this post). SQUEE didn't fill immediately but once I got it (after a misstep w/ScrEE) it was to me a very familiar term, maybe one has to be on Twitter or whatnot for it to be such a familiar (& IMO valid) word‚Ä¶ I can imagine Tina Fey/ Liz Lemon invoking it on 30 Rock. I've even seen it as a verb, e.g ""I squeed when he signed my book!""

I totally did not know 48A LOME, didn't really know COXES tho it rang true, had CLaMP (& CLing?) for 41A CLUMP‚Ä¶ as 11A filled I wondered if Ogden Nash had done cartoons as well as rhymes, & when NAST filled in I thought ""huh, NAST >>>",6,positive,0.923626720905304

All this, btw, after suffering greatly to fill in all the rest of the puzzle correctly and without cheating.  And all for naught, as it turned out.

"Nice, solid themeless to start off the weekend.

Seeing all the complaints/criticism has left me scratching my head. I came here anticipating a positive reaction from the group, perhaps even some complaints about this being too easy for a Saturday.

Crossword difficulty can be weirdly personalized. More often than not, if a puzzle strikes me as especially hard, I‚Äôll find that sentiment echoed in the Wordplay column/comments ‚Äî but occasionally, I‚Äôll slog through a grid and go way over my personal average, yet encounter a breezy comments section full of merry solvers.

I guess I just don‚Äôt get the folks who find a puzzle unusually challenging and are so quick to criticize *the puzzle* (often along with the constructor, the editor, and their extended families), and label it ‚Äúnot fun‚Äù, full of ‚Äúobscure trivia‚Äù, etc.

For me, the high degree of variability in puzzle difficulty is an essential part of what keeps me coming to the NYT crossword ever single morning.

I would consider the sandwich coins we've had since the 1960's BIMETALLIC, but apparently that term is reserved for coins with a central core surrounded by a ring of a different metal, like the bimetallic subway tokens New York was using for a while.

Speaking of coins, and of SQUIRCLES, when my wife and i were on vacation on Aruba we came across the rounded corner square 50 cent coins.

A lovely flowing grid with a soaring 18 longs (answers of eight letters or more), including 12 ten-letter answers!  This allows for many of those precious solving moments where the addition of one more cross rings the bell and brings the ‚ÄúAha!‚Äù.

Freshness, where a quarter of the answers have appeared four times or less in the 80-year-old Times puzzle, including eight first-timers, my favorites being SQUEE, SQUIRCLE, and LOCAL PAPER.

"I thought this one was going to be a breeze when LOCAL PAPER came to me immediately and delivered me the entire northwest. But then I ran into WALTHER PPK and the downfall began. 

Sometimes hard is just hard and not fun, and that's what today's puzzle was for me. I'd have preferred the clue, ""Reading for SOME who'd rather not read,"" when CDs are involved because that's a vanishing medium.

But as I often say, at least I can look forward to a new puzzle tomorrow",24,negative,0.6039790511131287
"@ Caitlin :

For COXES to face the rowers, they have to sit in the stern, not the bow, because the oarspeople are facing backwards themselves. And that‚Äôs exactly where they usually are. 

They can still be regatta leaders I guess because they steer, but if they were both facing the rowers and in the bow they wouldn‚Äôt be able to see where they were going because they‚Äôd be facing where they‚Äôd come from instead. 


I‚Äôm with you on 007‚Äôs gun. I managed the name of the company with a few crosses to prompt me, but the specific model required every cross and wasn‚Äôt going to come any other way. Not my wheelhouse, and I‚Äôm ok with that.",7,neutral,0.8071557879447937
"This one was so hard I could never have finished it without the Hub, who knew what Bond packed and a couple of others that righted some wrongs to set me on my way.  (He insists he could never do a puzzle, and I think I'll leave him in his state of ""ignorance.""  It means I get to be the smart one once in a while.)

When I was still in the opaque glass brain state, I wrote in 53A and took it out so many times it finally felt NOT CRICKET.  SQUIRCLE seemed really weirdISH until it gave me SQUEE, and I thought, Oh sure, SQUEE.  I say that all the time, doesn't everyone?  About that Manx, I was disappointed when GAEL muscled its way in, but at least the NE was done, and at last, the whole puzzle.  Nearly jumped out of my skin when the music blasted. No nits?

Okay Rich Norris, you had your fun, and to be honest so did I‚Äîbig time actually.  Thanks, but try not to get too much tougher, or I'm going to need more than a DOOR KEEPER.",25,neutral,0.38682428002357483
"Phew! Just phew!
I got misdirected so often in this puzzle which had very few gimmes for me (Walther PPK helped after a few letters). TEXAS_____ before TEXACOSTAR. Despite being sure of SIRI I kept looking for SQUAROID before SQUIRCLE which is a great word to learn. I had Elizabeth Warren maybe an Otoe even though I should have remembered Cherokee instead. Agree that SOHO is certainly not an acronym. But all things considered a fair though beastly challenge. The only thing that wasn‚Äôt really CRICKET for me was BOOKSONCD. Had to run the alphabet since I hadn‚Äôt heard of DOPESHEETS and can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever heard anyone really call it that‚Äîeveryone I know calls them Books on tape (even though they aren‚Äôt on tape) or audio books. But no complaints just glad I got through it.",6,neutral,0.44971829652786255

"I've now tried twice to reply to Keith Law's comment about acronyms.  The second time was definitely long enough to get by the birds, so I'm trying writing it as a separate comment...wish me luck!


Acronyms are defined in Merriam-Webster as comprising the first letter OR LETTERS of the constituent words of a phrase.

https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acronym

RADAR is a similar acronym that uses more than one letter per word.




EMU is Eastern Michigan University.  But it's an abbreviation, not an acronym, because the letters are read aloud individually, rather than as a word.",10,neutral,0.6248522996902466
This was a bit tough for me.  I cruised through about two thirds then hit a wall on the middle and SW.  I really wanted 37A to be Break (would have been funnier).  Wanted 52A to be mags (where's my mind?) and had the right answer for 39A but then second guessed and thought it might be LSD.  The breakthrough was getting 26D and then the rest fell into place STEP BY STEP.,6,neutral,0.49289408326148987

Definitely NOT CRICKET, regardless of which side of the Atlantic you're on.
