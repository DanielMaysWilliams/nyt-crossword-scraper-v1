"My solve was 14 minutes slower than my average. This was a difficult but very satisfying puzzle for me. I didn't know the first names of the Olympians, and I had ""OHISEE"" instead of ""OKISEE"", so I thought there were some athletes out there whose first names were Herri!

The Chinese greeting was completely unknown to me, and I got it from the crosses.

Always good to learn new things!",19,positive,0.6402416229248047
"A dragon of a puzzle, fire and brimstone and all that, but one full of illumination, from the mundane (SCOTTS) to the impressive (PHDS), with LESSONs from so many fills.  At first I thought GONG XI FA KAI was some kind of MEGA CON, a fill filled with mistakes, but it all worked out and after reading the column?‚ÄîOK I  SEE, OH DEAR it was LILAC pure and KOSHER all along.  

Welcome back, Zhouqin Burnikel, and  gong xi fa kai to you!  (Enjoy your veggie jiaozi and taro.) cakes!",10,positive,0.7832325100898743
"Just so someone knows they‚Äôre not alone: I had a very difficult time with this solve! It was wonderfully constructed, but a few spots just had intersections of multiple things I‚Äôd never heard of‚Äîluck of the draw, I guess!

Am I the only one who thought it was a little clunky to have ACAI intersect with another entry that ends with ‚Äúacai‚Äù?,3,negative,0.6086674928665161
"I'm surprised that so many people found this puzzle unusually easy.  It took me a looooong time to get some of the entries.  And I sure didn't know how to spell that greeting.  Used the crosses, and still misspelled it.  Ah, well.

My computer started acting up again, and I couldn't get to WP yesterday.  I looked and looked for links, but can't find any.  I hope no one missed me.  Or maybe I hope they did.

The clue for NAIL is nothing short of brilliant.  Made my (XWP) day!

Didn't know MEGACON.  I guessed at the CON part when I first got to the clue, but there are so many CONs out there with people dressed up in costumes, that I can't keep track.  Toyed with MAGACON for a bit (thinking MAGazines, but had to rely on the crosses.

Yes, CC, you stumped me.  So when I finally got stuff, I rejoiced and felt smart and competent!  Great puzzle.  Thanks.",16,negative,0.5483025312423706

"Whenever I solve a Friday or Saturday puzzle especially unusually quickly, I like to hop on here and see if a lot of others similarly breezed through the puzzle or if this was just a puzzle where the clues were in my wheelhouse of knowledge more than average. Sometimes it is both . . . the puzzle can be objectively and subjectively easy (or difficult). 

At any rate, I enjoyed this one as well as its relative lack of 3-letter crosswordese. And being a Gen Xer born in 1976 (a Dragon year, so I was aware 2024 is as well), I happened to get 16A right off the bat, which opened the puzzle up very quickly for me (especially for a Saturday).",9,positive,0.5317584872245789
"For whatever reason, I flew through this. Clearly, today I am a genius. All bets are off for tomorrow. 

And that speed was despite being unable to think of Polish cities other than Krakow and Gda≈Ñsk for several minutes. And having no idea how to spell GONG XI FA CAI beyond GONG XI. 

There were a number of clues that made me smile, but my favorite was NAIL. My first thought for ‚Äúdigital canvas‚Äù was NFTS, but NAIL is above and beyond.",8,positive,0.8960491418838501

"Has anyone ever retroactively lost a streak? I just noticed my streak had reset 18 games ago. I checked the archives and had all gold stars for January 2024.  By counting, I opened the puzzle that would have been the issue and, on opening it, my gold star puzzle turned blue right before my eyes.

"Re 50A, Woodrow Wilson and Gordon Brown received PhDs almost a century apart (from Johns Hopkins and the University of Edinburgh, respectively). Both doctorates were in History.

I wonder about referring to them as ‚Äúhonors,‚Äù though, as they were both earned degrees rather than honorary awards.

I certainly wouldn‚Äôt argue that the PhD made either man a more effective leader, but I do think we‚Äôd be better off if politicians knew more about the past than is currently fashionable.",75,neutral,0.8919909000396729

"Fun bonus puzzle to figure out what the 61A might have been in the original. (See Constructor Note).   I‚Äôm guessing YESSIR instead of KOSHER, but I‚Äôm usually wrong about such things.

A lovely New Year‚Äôs puzzle and great to see CC here any day of the week.  Fun to remember KERRI Strug‚Äôs Olympic heroics, and of course learning Chinese is a bonus.  The juxtaposition of TEARS STAIN (evoking the Trail of Tears) and BLACK HILLS is poignant.  Indeed, the puzzle is chock full of beauty and whimsy.  Thank you, C.C.!",14,positive,0.8808054327964783

That didn't stop me from having problems in other areas--like COMICON for MEGACON and figuring out how to spell GONG XI FA CAI, but it all worked out nicely.
