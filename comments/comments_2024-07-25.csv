"I've had a streak since failing last Thursday's abomination. Not because I used checks or revealed anything, but because I've put over 2 hours cumulative into this puzzle and now the Friday is already up.

"Loved this Crossword!!!! I had more trouble with the NE corner than with the theme or the rebuses.  I had to check with the forum to get instructions on the entry of the rebuses.  I didn't know if I could type in ( ! ) or type something else in with the bang.  
As for Epsom, I was so committed to Eaton and all those mineral springs that I spent a lot of time off track. Once I changed Eaton, that corner took care of itself and I finished.

I think that the clues and the wordplay did not overtake the rebuses and overwhelm this player.  The theme was the star and provided the fun.  The words and wordplay were just right in the clueing and the crosses worked well. Not too easy, not too hard, just right. Another Goldilocks today. (I know this is a personal opinion, what is hard to me is often very easy for other folks) But today this Thursday rebus was so much fun that  I give it 5 !!!!! with a BANG!

"Apologies for offering this comment a couple of days late.  I have run into trouble trying to submit comments on my iPhone for the last two days.  And with the Olympics now only a day away, the comment seems even more appropriate (to me anyway):

Speaking of things Olympic, I was channel surfing late yesterday evening and found myself watching the tail end of ‚ÄúChariots of Fire‚Äù.  I had forgot what an outstanding movie that was; particularly as it was based on a true story of Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell, who both competed for Great Britain in the 1924 Paris Olympics.  Until watching it once again, I hadn‚Äôt realized ‚Äî maybe I am one of the last to have realized it? ‚Äî that this year‚Äôs Paris Olympics is exactly 100 years since it was last held there (although, google tells me that the events are being held all over France ‚Äî and even in Tahiti).  

‚ÄúChariots of Fire‚Äù is one of those movies I have watched several times and could never tire of watching again.  Others in that category:

Rocky
Back to the Future (the original)
Raiders of the Lost Ark

As to what it is about each of those movies (and probably several others that would be on my list but won‚Äôt come to my mind in the wee hours of the morning when I ought to be sleeping), the one thing that occurs to me is the unforgettable musical score in each of them.

The most popular versions are the still-water which comes in a blue plastic bottle, the intensely carbonated one in a red bottle, and a couple of others including my favorite, the naturally sparkling Marie-Henriette. I found it interesting that these waters are so common that in the Dutch culture when you go to a restaurant they don‚Äôt ask you if you want ‚Äústill‚Äù or ‚Äúsparkling‚Äù water, but rather do you want ‚Äúblauw‚Äù (blue) or ‚Äúrood‚Äù (red) water, and it has nothing to do with the brand of water you are going to get.

Some randos:
Strictly speaking, Zeus's mother, Rhea, was one of the six Titanesses (Œ±·º± Œ§·øëœÑ·æ±ŒΩ·øêÃÅŒ¥ŒµœÇ). 

Speaking of mothers, does anyone remember Darren Aronovsky's 2017 allegory *Mother!*? My friend Tom loved that movie, and saw it at least three times in the theaters, and three bazillion more on DVD. He gifted me a copy, and it was OK, although, like a poor Thursday puzzle, I caught on to the gimmick way to fast; and in the end, I would have prefer to watch *Oklahoma!*, *Hello, Dolly!""*, or even *Oliver!*.

I've never had problems with the word MOIST, but apparently Katie does: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89Lk7eOkht4

When I began elementary school, Elmer's glue had not yet been invented. Instead, we had bottles of Lepage's Mucilage for our projects, which came in a little glass bottle with a rubber top that had a slit for the glue to be dabbed out. Once Elmer's became a classroom staple, we bid adieu to Lepage's.

I just did some research and learned that it is still available, though not in it's original form or by the original company. Here's a link to the history and current usages. I think you'll find it fascinating!

Perhaps one day I will write an ode to Aqua Net! Yes, perhaps we put the ozone in great peril, but dang our BANGs were fine!!
