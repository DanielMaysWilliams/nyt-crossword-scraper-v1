"I have run a analysis program on this puzzle which gives some metrics about its suitability for the NYT on Tuesday.

The Heitzel-Norman coefficient for proper nouns is 16.7, which is slightly about the 14.8 average for Tuesdays, but well within the 13-20 guideline.

The Planck-Einstein probabilities for NATICKS was 0.097.  Anything under 0.1 is considered acceptable risks, except for those who actually *live* in Natick.

And the Sapplestein continued fraction for under-documented words is 107 over 316, which is a tad high or a Tuesday, but there have been several Wednesdays with scores in the range of 90-120 over low 300s, so it's not too out-of-line.

Finally the Lifshitz parameter for annoyance is 12.2, which is probably too high for the most accomplished puzzle-complainers.

Now we can all debate this puzzle with the hard numbers in mind.",12,neutral,0.8835551738739014

"It's funny how all-over-the-map the solves were today. Some set new records (I was a little more than half my Tuesday avg) and a lot of people felt it was hard for a Tuesday. 

If you go to the town of Natick's website, you can find Rex Parker's explanation of the term ""Natick"":

A long time ago, I was solving this puzzle and got stuck at an unguessable (to me) crossing: N. C. WYETH crossing NATICK at the “N”—I knew WYETH but forgot his initials, and NATICK … is a suburb of Boston that I had no hope of knowing. It was clued as someplace the Boston Marathon runs through (???). Anyway, NATICK— the more obscure name in that crossing—became shorthand for an unguessable cross, esp. where the cross involves two proper nouns, neither of which is exceedingly well known. NATICK took hold as crossword slang, and the term can now be both noun (“I had a NATICK in the SW corner…”) or verb (“I got NATICKED by 50A / 34D!”)
===================
So yes, anyone who doesn't know the answers to two crossing clues--particularly when both are proper nouns--can claim a personal Natick. 

I enjoyed this puzzle. It was in my wheelhouse (obvi given my solve time). I knew WILLY LOMAN, EARTHA Kitt, AKITA, I___Pavlov [Ivan or Igor?], and several others on my first pass. Geography is a weak suit, so LUKASA came entirely from crosses, but all six crosses fell on my first pass. Needed crosses for PALAU as well, but got them all on first or second pass.

"The theme didn’t quite come together for me. Generally, I look forward to the (often pun-fueled) “aha” moment of filling in the revealer and seeing the way it ties the theme entries together, but this time, my reaction was more of an “I guess.” Pavlov and Quasimodo are gimmes, and Peale was a nice addition to the theme, but Willy Loman and Santa Claus left me scratching my head, Sure, Santa’s associated with the sound of sleighbells, but it’s hardly the first thing that comes to mind when you hear the name. It took some further thinking to realizethe bells mentioned here are the ones associated not with Saint Nick himself but specifically with the Salvation Army Santas. And as for Willy Loman, I know enough about the play to know the name but not enough to associate him with bells — I came to the column hoping to be enlightened and was disappointed to discover that the only connection to the theme was that he is a door-to-door salesman.

I did enjoy the repetition of “hold your horses,” the guest appearances by Eartha Kitt and Syd Hoff, and the tangentially theme-related “heralds.” (On that note, there are enough holiday-related entries in this grid that it might have worked better in December rather than May.)

"With apologies - a late puzzle find, inspired by (for no discernible reason) wondering about answers that might just have a number as a clue. e.g.

""24"" HOURSINADAY
And then a nice sequence:
""76"" TROMBONES
""77"" SUNSETSTRIP
""78"" RPM 

And that led me to stumble across a remarkable puzzle from Sunday June 21, 1998 by Jim Page with the title ""Do the Math."" 

In that one, the theme clues either added to or subtracted from the actual clue number to give the hint for the answer. Some examples:

22a. ""+43"" - RETIREMENTAGE
48A. ""-3"" - GUNCALIBER
65A. ""-41"" - HOURSINADAY

"For those who thought LUSAKA was too difficult, whether straight out or as a cross, I recommend a game I play called World Geography by Atom Games. It's readily available, at least in the Google Play store. It doesn't take long at all to play a round or two and it's somewhat addictive in a really fun, non harmful, and educational way. I started it about a year before I started the crosswords, which was about 10 months ago now, and it totally helps my crossword game! Before I was playing that, I would also have not known LUSAKA so easily. (Although I wouldn't have considered it a terrible puzzle because I didn't know something...) 😉

But more importantly, it really helps me understand the world better and put so much of the news I hear in a more robust context. 

What more could you ask for than fun games that actually teach us stuff, like the geography game and NYT crossword puzzles!? I'm in my early/mid 50s and I find so many things that either I never knew or I possibly forgot--and I rejoice at the learning! 

As a kid, I aced geography (and most of my non-math classes) because I was always a good test taker but I didn't care a whit about geography and purged those rote learnings from my mind.....  and now I have a second chance when I actually do care! Loving it!

"Going to go against the grain here, did not enjoy this puzzle. 

While the theme rings true to each character, the theme clues does not actually help solve the others as they are all proper nouns. Having to recall Pavlov's and Willy's full name is not satisfying fill. This problem is further exasperated by the over use of proper nouns in this puzzle and several proper noun crossings. A much more satisfying theme clue would of helped hint to fill in the characters full names. A better puzzle does not have proper noun crossings.

I'm seeing a lot of varying mileage out here about it though, which is always fair, but I don't think liking or disliking a puzzle makes it great or terrible.... Just varying mileage.

I struggle with most and sometimes I love them more for it. 

But, I guess I don't know who the ultimate judge of great or terrible puzzles is though. 🤔

I presume it's an emu of unusual size and wisdom.

"Man, I got to the first themer and was curious so I went to the revealer and solved it so quick I thought the rest of the puzzle might be pretty easy.  Boy was I wrong!  I needed every brain cell for it.  I was thrilled to see EARTHA KITT! She reminds me of my grandma. And I loved the ERAS clue.

I also put HUNCHBACK in there - oops. Also struggled with LUSAKA. But ATWATER was a gimme, and once I figured out how to spell EARTHA, she fit in quite nicely as well. 
Well done - I hope to see more of your puzzles!",10,positive,0.924769401550293

"“Remember this!” (THE ALAMO)  

I hope this helps others learn more about puzzle nuances.  I asked in yesterday’s comments about the clue “Call me!” (CAB) and @Lewis kindly explained it by writing, “ When you have a clue with an exclamation mark but no quotation marks, that clue refers directly to the answer.  So the answer to  [There's the rub!], for instance, which has appeared in the Times puzzle twice, is SPA, and that's what ""there"" refers to (a rub is another word for a massage).

In [Call me!], the ""me"" refers to the cab.”

I find it funny that “Remember this!” was a clue today. I will remember that.",18,positive,0.5662593841552734

"I thought this was a well put together puzzle with a cute theme (even if, as some have noted, WILLYLOMAN wasn’t really a bell ringer).  I didn’t have much trouble with the answers that seem to be bothering some solvers, except LUKASA, which was easy enough from the crosses.  One man’s Natick is another man’s gimme, I guess.",19,positive,0.7927907109260559
"A few brief hesitations waiting on crosses, but no problems getting through this one. It's been a long time (an ERA?) since I read ""Death of a Salesman"", but I did remember WILLY LOMAN. Took a bit longer and crosses to get ATWATER. I've definitely been wearing the TEES the last few days (90s °F)—the heat's been AWFUL. Getting the revealer led to getting a nice AHA moment.

Nice debut, Justin, and thanks!",12,positive,0.4886617362499237
"This one goes out to ad absurdum...

Photo Deciphering 101:
(Also known as 'What on earth is Sam's message to us mortal souls')

- Begin with the title.
""Sound of Enlightenment"" (a reference to 58D clue.)

- Notice the photo is of Long Island SOUND

- Notice, too, that the sky is awash with light. ENLIGHTENMENT

-This brings us to (Long Island) Sound of En(light)enment.

-Which, ironically, once deciphered, brings us back 58D answer: AHA! Now I get it!

"My last to fall was the L of LUSAKA and WILLYLOMAN.
It's been too long since I read 'Death of a Salesman' and I just didn't remember the capital of Zambia.
I thought I might have to do an alphabet run but, lo and behold, LUSAKA suddenly rang a bell! How perfect. The joke's on me.

Some puzzles make you feel smart and cultured, either because you know the answers or because you're learning them. 
This one did it for me. 
And I was quite surprised by the rich fill and cluing, what with it being a Tuesday.

This was a very tight, strong, and interesting offering, Mr. Werfel.

THANK you!",39,positive,0.5037928819656372
"I’m being picky, but Willy Loman isn’t a “door-to-door” salesman of the ilk that rings a bell… he is a traveling salesman, yes, but he sells to department stores… he “vital in New England,” ya know.

"I’ve been refraining from commenting on this, but Joel Fagliano has a LONG way to go before he takes full control of the prestigious role of the NYT XWORD editor.
