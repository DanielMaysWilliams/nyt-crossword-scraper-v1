I liked so many of the clues and answers in this. It felt like a slowly coming together jigsaw puzzle. Very enjoyable.

I also very much appreciated all the other Christmas references strewn about. Nice touch!

You've gifted us a truly delightful puzzle.

Thank you.",16,positive,0.9820818305015564
"So can someone tell me how to put 3 letters in one space? Can't stand it when I complete the puzzle, but it won't recognize it because I can't put 3 letters in on space. This happens far too often.",0,negative,0.8859491944313049

"A classic Christmas Sunday puzzle, very satisfying, very readable. And a classical one, too. Those who don't know the story of Hero and Leander will be forgiven for thinking it's a story about two guys. But Hero was actually she/her: a priestess in the cult of Aphrodite who lived in a tower on the Dardanelles Strait in NW Turkey, then called the Hellespont. Leander (he/him) lived on the other side. Having fallen in love, he swam across to visit her each night, guided by a light in her tower. Their affair became R-RATED. Despite agreeing to a ""hiatus"" during the winter storm season, Leander couldn't resist and attempted the strait during a dark and rainy night -- a wind blew out Hero's light, Leander lost his way and ended up drowning, washed to shore in front of Hero's tower, much to her horror; she threw herself from the tower to join him in death, prefiguring Romeo and Juliet: it's appropriate to see them in this puzzle, too. Cruel fate indeed.

There are other classical allusions here, too: Rhea, the earth goddess, Eros (""Aphrodite's frequent companion""), Iris, the Acropolis, mead -- a beverage with neolithic roots, well known in both India and the Greek archipelago (Aristotle liked it), the Latin umbra -- the spirit or phantom of a dead person residing in the underworld, Calypso -- a nymph/goddess sent to live on an ISLE in punishment for her crimes. So for a puzzle with a purportedly Christmassy theme, this has a lovely pagan vibe the pantheist in me fully embraces!",36,positive,0.7618815302848816

Waiting and hoping
