Thanks for a delightful Saturday puzzle, Rich, and thanks for your column, Caitlin, and for the link about fog in the Bay Area.

"Freddy Mercury was born in Africa, but he was born a British subject in a British protectorate, and perhaps that is why the constructor of the clue did not consider him ‚ÄúAfrican-born‚Äù.

Whether the constructor of the clue realized that Sade performed at Live Aid as the band Sade and not as a solo artist is another question, as not all members of Sade are African-born. Regardless it‚Äôs a poorly written clue that appears to have been lifted straight out of Wikipedia without much thought.

It was the crossing of A?AHL and A?AT. I tried a couple options that sounded right and then I realized that at that point, just guessing at answers was no more solving without (my definition of) helps than looking it up, so I looked it! The rest was completely clean though and I feel pretty proud of that... but I save my huzzahs for totally clean!  üòä

So yeah, it was hard for me but I enjoyed it a lot! Definitely more than a single SCAD! 

Loved PIANO TUNER! I guess that ""You can tune a piano but you can't tuna fish"" is too long for a crossword answer, but it would be fun. At least for me! Oooh, maybe with a rebus! 

The CARE TO ELABORATE took longer than it should have for me because I kept seeing the ABO and thinking it would be aBOUt... like, ""Tell me about it."" Now that one wouldn't work but there were a surprising number of variations that did. 

Only thing I was sure of in the NE was LYNX, being a proper Minnesotan!  Oh, and putting bad RAP there had to be untangled but I've gotten much better at ripping stuff out when it doesn't serve.

  Life for death

I prefer those that allow you to solve with incomplete information.

Hard crosswords are similar in many ways, I think. This puzzle, for me, was a delight, because of the way a couple of crosses opened up long or at first unknown answers that appeared at first impenetrable. It offered me constant moments of ""Oh, that must be....."" and the answer was always perfectly logical and often quite witty.

Just wonderful.

And thank you for my LOL moment for that TREE entry. I'm kind of proud that, as a childless lady who has a grown niece, hence no reason to attend children's plays, the answer came to me immediately.
(Gosh, I think the last time I watched a children's play might have been in the movie ""Love, Actually."")

Liked that ""Foggy"" appeared in 12D and ""Illinois"" in 47A, nicely resonating with Sandburg's ONLITTLECATFEET.

Immediately (and wrongly) entered THROUGHPUT instead of ACCESSTIME for 5A.

But it‚Äôs a delicate dance, making a puzzle like this, because you need just the right amount of toeholds.  Too many, and the puzzle loses its Saturday toughness.  Too few, and the puzzle becomes no-fun-frustrating.  

For me, Rich and the editors nailed it.  So many times, I went from being stalled, to having an answer ping out in my brain, which led to a mini-splat-fill, followed by another stall.  As more filled in, the answering pace quickened, leading to a marvelous crescendo to the finish.

"This puzzle felt way harder while doing it than my time shows. I was expecting to finish well over my average after the first few passes but once I shook off the Saturday morning sleepies I was able to come in under by a good margin. 

While I must have gotten in the flow considering my time it never felt like it while filling it in.",8,neutral,0.4925215244293213

Had me very stuck in the bottom right for a long time. Questioning if KNICKS and ICEES really were correct.

"Anyone else get hung up on ‚ÄúNancy‚Äù as the Drew of many lines? Just me? OK.

(It felt a little off to me, too. But I told myself there were lots of sentences in those books!)

Ah well. Despite feeling like I was IN A STUPOR for most of the puzzle, I guess I had a SCAD of fun. Just one, though.",24,neutral,0.5792273283004761

"[shrug] I'll be the voice of dissent - this was so much harder than yesterday.

"Drew CAREY, PIANO TUNER, CARESS and bunch other answers came so easily that I thought it was a super easy Saturday but I was wrong wrong. There were tough spots all around for me so it took work to get it done but I enjoyed it for the most part.  I had Tom for TAZ for a while and correcting helped a lot.  

I had to do some plugging on the Latin and the German crosses (ending with the Latin) but I got it done.",12,positive,0.8926013112068176
"So many factual clues and answers known or easily filled in using the crosses made this seem like a very unSaturday Saturday to me.  Yet there was also some tricky stuff.  All in all very fun to solve. 

Do they still teach the Carl Sanburg poem in elementary school, I wonder? 
I think that must have been a gimme for people of a certain age.",12,positive,0.9110305309295654
"Rats! I was so proud of myself knowing ONLITTLECATSFEET right off the bat. But misremembered it with the S; it was too long so I deleted it, only to later see I was (almost) right all along. Still solved quite briskly and probably would have gotten a PB if not for that small delay.

Over too soon! Enjoy your Caturday everyone!",12,positive,0.4568099081516266
"When I finally took out the 20th Century Perry and replaced him with the 21st Century Perry, what was shaping up to be The LONGEST DAY‚ÄîI DONT GET IT, suddenly ITT was here IT IS.  There were some tricks and traps and some puzzlers that should have been obvious but weren't to me (TAZ‚Äîwho else?  EXGI‚Äîwell yes!  SCAD‚ÄîI thought they only came in bunches, but they had to start somewhere).

Thank you, Rich Norris.  Easy to see you're a real pro at this and know how to construct a puzzle that will be both easy and tough, all at the same time.  I wouldn't say I'm in ECSTASY, but I sure had a lot of fun!",30,neutral,0.4343325197696686

"I managed somehow to type an O in the square that should have held the second A in ELABORATE, making it impossible to see IN A STUPOR for a few minutes. Otherwise, it was a breezy solving experience. 

I wish I could say the same about Rich Norris‚Äô 1990s puzzles. For a while, it felt like every Saturday puzzle I solved in the archives was one of his, and they all seemed pretty tough.",12,neutral,0.4578660726547241

Nice puzzle though.  Intimidating at first, as I suppose it should be.
