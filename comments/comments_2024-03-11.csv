"Minor pedantic quibble on 1A:
gram is the SI unit of mass, not weight
The metric unit of weight is the Newton

"As a homebrewer, I have used malted barley and malted wheat at times. I was actually going to complain about the 4D clue, but, upon reflection, I have no problem with it. When I place an order for brewing grains, I regularly talk about the malt I want, and there are different types. For example, my most recent batch used UK Pale, UK Medium Crystal and UK Dark Crystal to make an ESB, a type of British ale. The malts all happen to be barley, but I referred to them by the names listed above and never said the word ""barley"" when placing the order.

Until you start seeing kitchen scales calibrated in millinewtons, and bathroom scales in newtons, you have no valid criticism. 

Furthermore, I bet you have no trouble at all with the operational equivalence of the ""pound"" as both a functional unit of weight and of mass. The same goes for the gram.

GRAM, MALT, and isn't EMAIL 'so yesterday?'

ELLY (usually ELLIE) is short for ELEANOR/ELINOR.

One  of my brother's Exes, named 'Cornelia' remarried, but her new husband insisted on calling her ELLIE.  Why not 'NEELY'?  We don't know; guess he just did not like her given name, which one admits is not euphonious.  

There is never much to say about Monday puzzles (other than 'over too soon.')  How 'bout that Jimmy Kimmel?

A word about APPLES TO APPLES.  Rex explains it well and it sounds like a lot of fun to play.  Especially for us word-loving types.  Once again, something that arrived really late in my life.

"Liked the puzzle! Did not have issue with gram - I've seen for those in the metric system it's interpreted similar to pounds in the US where weight and mass are not differentiated in the everyday. 

Conch took me back to lord of the flies. Is tribalism innate in us? Or can we we band together and overcome our differences and live in harmony? These days it's challenging, but always worth keeping an open mind and treating others with respect! Having other perspectives strengthens the team and we don't have to all agree completely to get along. Am I talking about the comments section or our politics? The answer is yes :)

"My cynical brain wants to think that the controversial clues for GRAM and MALT were intentionally used to stoke the comments on a Monday puzzle.  

I know a gram is a measure of mass, everyone knows a gram is measure of mass, but here on Earth, it also serves as a measure of weight.

Malt is made from grain.  But to refer to it as grain seemed out of place for Monday cluing.",10,negative,0.575985848903656
"I am so confused by the complaints about the GRAM clue. I live in a metric system country, and the answer was 100% obvious to me. Over here nobody except physicists distinguishes between mass and weight in spoken, and even written language - and even physicists only do it in a scientific context. In everyday, living language, mass=weight. The last time anybody insisted I distinguish between mass and weight was in the Physics course at primary and high school.

Polish food products are labeled with ""masa netto"" (net mass), not ""ciƒô≈ºar netto"" (net weight). Interestingly, if the label is dual language, the label reads:

Masa netto/Net weight

I'm trying to recall if a certain constructor played apples to apples in her formative years, but thinking poker and repeated missions to survive the Oregon Trail won out? An almost quick Monday for me but I'll attribute the longer time to a late west coast to east coast flight. Despite a fambam text letting me know the puzzle was out, I needed to wait for the coffee pot to finish.

"Great fun, as every theme game had a catchy name, and there was pop strewn around the grid as well ‚Äì GLADES, SCATHE, TINKERS, BROGUE, KIOSKS, BE REAL, ALL TALK.  A spate of spark pumping energy into the fill-in.  AMPED UP indeed.

And plenty of brainwork for me, as well, because I left the revealer blank and tried to guess what it was without reading the clue (something I have trouble with).  And I indeed had plenty of trouble with that today, much to my brain‚Äôs delight.  I finally started uncovering the revealer‚Äôs letters, starting with the first, and finally, after THE HU, did it come to me.  Small steps.

But still my brain wanted more, so I scanned the grid for serendipities, and there was: 
‚Ä¢ HEAD next to CASE 
‚Ä¢ The PuzzPair¬© of START and END 
‚Ä¢ A backward MAIL to complement EMAIL
‚Ä¢ A, Boggle-style YOO crossing a Boggle-style HOO (between CANDY CRUSH and the revealer). 
‚Ä¢ SIR next to TAT led me to search to find a former with the latter, and Sir Ian McKellan came up, as he got an arm tattoo as a memento for his ‚ÄúLord of the Rings‚Äù stint.

"If I may--ahem--weigh in for a minute: MALT really bothered me, for the reasons discussed below; GRAM not so much--when I measure out 200g of sugar, I don't count out the individual molecules of C12H22O11*, I flick the switch on my digital--ahem--scale from lbs. to gms. and dump it on. 

But then, I hate using those European recipes.

[Ozs. and ozs.] could be QTS--anyone considered that?

*Which, depending on its structure, could be sucrose or--ahem--maltose. Chef's tip: when measuring out corn syrup or other maltose-rich liquids (or honey), spray your measuring cup with pay-spray first, and it won't stick. Unless you're making meringue, which the oils in the pan spray might adversely affect. In any case, I prefer to weigh out 200g of corn syrup than use a liquid measure--about 150ml for corn syrup, as it has a much higher density than water.",2,negative,0.6814728379249573
