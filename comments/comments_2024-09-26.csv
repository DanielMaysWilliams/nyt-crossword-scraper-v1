"This was a pretty easy puzzle for me, only a couple minutes off from my personal best. Panacea in the top left screwed me over so bad, still kinda salty about that one. A good chunk of the clues were clear to me so I had solid footholds everywhere. 

I ignored the theme for the most part and solved this as a themeless puzzle, relying on the crosses for the shaded cells. Does anyone else solve their puzzles this way?

"Personal best and first Thursday without any lookups. Also took less than half the time as yesterday's so-called ""Wednesday"" puzzle.

"I don‚Äôt typically comment on these columns as I‚Äôm usually solving later in the day, but I felt compelled to chime in on this one. I absolutely *loved* today‚Äôs puzzle. What a joy of a theme! 

Taking a correct stab at 1D out of the gate helped with some crosses in the NW corner. (Particularly, 16A, 18A, 22A, and 26A were quick ones.) That informed some other downs in that corner, which let me identify the reversal theme‚ÄîI felt so certain of 32A‚Äôs STEP ON IT! The ‚Äúoohhh‚Äù moment of reversing N-I as I did T-E to allow for RESIDUE and UPSTART and seeing SET POINT emerge was so wonderful. It was great fun working from that corner outward radially and trying to visualize both the clued answer along with the written answer for the theme entries. A new Thursday record for me, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the puzzle. 

Congrats to Jesse on a fantastic debut! Truly an achievement!",9,positive,0.9725144505500793

I have dinner plans, so am going to leave and come back full of tostadas and quacamole shared with friends and family.  Maybe I can do this.  I am not enjoying the double reverse, and fail to really see the point no matter what lipstick we put on it.  I can see how it is a challenge for the constructor who should be very proud of his creation.  As for a solve that spells out LasVegas that is really salvages and the clue seems irrelevant to the whole enterprise until it is solved. So very backwards.  My brain is just struggling with this.

On the downside.... I work with people who struggle with their mental health. And I grew up with people who struggled. So I felt disappointed to see CRAZIES and kooks here. It's in the language, I know, but the language can hurt.

At least Tarantino, ANGELOU, and ASSANGE are famous in more than one country, and the (U.S. college board only) AP-whatever shows up in the NYT crossword often enough to be easy to fill. 

Yeah, yeah. I know it's a New York paper published in the USA. But surely a bit of effort could make the puzzle less parochial? I admit KOTB is a toughie, but both IDA and LON could easily be clued in a way that doesn't require one to know U.S. only trivia.",6,neutral,0.5995663404464722

Knowing that even with a theme like this, the entered words have to be a real word, the theme answers filled in quickly and helped with a few of the downs. 

I used to find Thursdays extremely difficult, but I have been working through the archived Thursdays, so far back to 2020, and I now find them much easier and love them!

"I'll admit, I used to hate Thursday puzzles when I started solving regularly a few months back. Looking back, I can see that a lot of that was because A) I didn't know when to expect a gimmick (I hadn't been told Thursday was the day) and B) I didn't know what type of gimmicks I could usually expect to see.

Nowadays I still get frustrated from time to time, but I've found myself looking forward to Thursdays; identifying and dealing with the trick has become a real treat. Today's puzzle is no exception!

The gimme answers to 8 and 32 across really helped kickstart the solve for me. When I noticed that the Down crosses didn't quite seem to match it immediately clued me in to what was going on. I never really felt like I needed to plainly google an answer, and the only use the engine got was to confirm answers that I was 99% sure were right, and sure enough they were.

I also don't know much about Quentin Tarantino and his nominations. But it was a long answer, so it was easier to figure out, and that's when I got the theme.

The rest went very quickly, and I even got the revealer from the crosses, which were relatively simple for me, not like a Thursday at all. So I didn't have to know anything about football after all. But a very clever puzzle.",8,neutral,0.5120701789855957

My only complaint is with the NYT's formatting:
I solve on the website on a PC, and, in puzzles such as this, where some squares are grayed out, once the entry is highlighted in blue and yellow, it becomes impossible to discern the gray.
I caught on to the reversed letters pretty quickly, and only a little later noticed that the resulting entries were still vald words; but after that, I just tried to think of such ""valid words"" which would work with the crosses, and then try to figure out the anagrams.

"Three questions for Jesse:

First, How did you come up with this theme?  Did you look at a term, say, CURE-ALL, and in a flash see that it can become CRUELLA?  Did you come across the phrase DOUBLE REVERSE, imagine it as a revealer, then brainstorm how that could translate into a theme?

Second, how did you find these theme answers?  They are more complicated than being simply anagrams, as they involve turned-around letters in specific places.  Did you write a computer program?  Did you search words manually hoping to find candidates?

Third, did you come up with additional theme answers?  This seems like a tight theme, and I‚Äôm guessing it is, because worthy alternative theme answers aren't showing up in the comments, but my guess could be wrong.

Jesse ‚Äì can you chime in here?  Crossnerd me, and I‚Äôm guessing others, would find the answers very interesting.

There's a restaurant I like to go to but I only like one thing on the menu.  They serve it every day except Thursday, when the chef likes to be a big showoff and make something that is too clever by half. I mean, it's not even what I consider to be ""real"" food, just some weird hybrid they try to pass off as a meal.  Just to spite everyone, I go each Thursday and get the ""special"" dish, and of course, I don't like it.  I then complain about my meal  and loudly bemoan the fact that my favorite dish is unavailable on Thursday.  I often get angry and say things that other diners (who seem to love this nonsensical excuse for food) label as ""unkind"".  I let them know that the chef is lazy and the support staff is incompetent for allowing this poor excuse for cooking.  I'm sure you'll find this hard to believe, but some people actually seem to think that *I* am the problem.

First, the construction was impressive. I was amazed by the themed entries being actual words when arranged both ways - I can remember a puzzle from a few weeks ago where some of the themers were gibberish when read this way or that. No such clunky problems today. Truly awesome ü§©

Second, the theme was sport-based, and American sport, too, yet I dealt with it üí™üèæ!Obviously I had no idea what the revealer might be right off the bat (please appreciate the baseball idiom. Soon I'll be an Ameircan. Too bad I couldn't think of a football expression to better match the grid).

Third, there wasn't as much trivia as there sometimes is on Thursday, and what little of it there was I mostly knew. Finally I remembered KOTB and IDA without Googling! I did lookup the Greek letter and that Latin term for the thing under your nose though.

"All of these ""I don't enjoy these gimmicks"" type of comments lead me to believe that the general public has been told ""Anyone can solve the NYT crossword"" a bit too many times.

For those who are unfamiliar with American football plays, a DOUBLE REVERSE is a running play. The quarterback takes the ball and starts running with it in one direction.  He then hands the ball to a teammate running in the opposite direction. If done correctly, this throws off the defense's balance, and it leads to a big gain.  This is known as a reverse.

A DOUBLE REVERSE is when all the above happens, and then the second ball carrier hands the ball off again to yet another teammate, who runs again in the opposite direction, which is to say, the original direction that the quarterback started running.  The hope is that the defense will be so off-balance by then that a huge gain will be gotten.  

Of course, a good defense knows when to be on the lookout for such a play, but it often works with the right personnel.

Sometimes, just a fake of a handoff to another player will throw the defense off enough for a substantial gain.",21,negative,0.544174075126648

What in TARNATION is often how I feel while watching a Tarantino movie.  Loved the humor.,20,positive,0.9626981616020203
Was doing really well except for the NE corner. Had to google to get IDA and LON. I wish the clues would also pertain to the scrambled word. For example: ‚ÄúWonder drug or puppy killer?‚Äù Or am I missing something?,3,neutral,0.5053145885467529
"Felt easier than Wednesday. Got the gimmick pretty quickly, but needed 26 guesses for that ABSALOM/LAT crossing. As a fun aside, after getting stuck in the NW corner, I took a break. During the break I happened to randomly see a meme about CRUELLA de ville.  When I went back to the puzzle it clicked",9,positive,0.789823055267334
"This was a very clever theme and an enjoyable solve. Once discovered, the application of the double reverse to one clue could actually be used to help solve the other ones. I truly appreciated this. It was also fun to see new words form when the letters were reversed. Many thanks to Mr. Guzman for a fun challenge and good ending to Wednesday evening.",23,positive,0.9819731712341309
"Fun gimmick.  

My only real complaint is that between the font style and size, that letter in 8D could have been from at least three different alphabets.  But maybe that was the point.",7,neutral,0.4625976085662842
15 Minutes less than my average Thursday! I just wanted to make a record of that somewhere. Nothing to add other than I enjoyed it.,21,positive,0.8331196904182434
"Great debut, Jesse! Very clever. Enjoyed solving once I skipped to the revealer and figured out the trick. Looking forward to more of your puzzles. Always amazed at puzzles constructed by high school and college students. Like where do they find the time? I barely managed to get my laundry done between classes and homework. Impressive!",21,positive,0.9838557839393616
"Too many negative comments about this fun puzzle. I was confused by the inability of APITALIAN and TARANTINO to cross, until I got enough of the downs at the bottom of the grid to get enough letters to be able to reveal double reverse (I know nothing about Football). Then, it was super fun to figure out all the reversals and I was delighted that they were real words like tarnation and gloats. Save your negativity and snarkiness for something that actually deserves it.",34,neutral,0.40048298239707947
"That was fun!  Was puzzling over why my fills were not forming the  name of the movie director or the obvious answer on the top right corner - but then I solved the revealer, and everything fell into place.",15,positive,0.8505520820617676
Thoroughly enjoyable.  It took a while to see CRUELLA as a DOUBLE REVERSE for CURE ALL but it was a thrill when it became evident.  More like this please - I wish we had more Thursdays in a week.,27,positive,0.9778385758399963
Once again I solved in less than my average time without discovering the gimmick.,4,neutral,0.45589879155158997
"Marvelous debut, very clever indeed, Mr. Guzman! Hats off to you. I loved everything about it.",14,positive,0.9875098466873169
"I thought this was a great debut puzzle! I don't know much about American football (I prefer Australian Rules football), but getting the revealer in the bottom line definitely helped see what was going on with the shaded letters.

Oh, and my streak hit 1000 today! :)
(Under my average Thursday time too)",70,positive,0.9390578269958496
Great Thursday debut and really loved the theme entries. Dying to know if the constructor used a computer program to come up with the theme. Pretty impressive.,8,positive,0.9843207597732544
Awesome! Love a tricky original theme.,14,positive,0.9840187430381775
"My recurring amusement when we have clued/unclued pairs‚Ä¶

A CUREALL drug was developed for CRUELLA de Vil: she then preferred recycled fleece garments instead of fur.

An unskilled debater wants to GO LAST - it means he GLOATS that he won.

My SET POINT is to get all this lawn mowed in an hour - so STEP ON IT!

Oh TARNATION!  Some of the nominations of TARANTINO did not end up winning.

Occasionally a person at the slots in LAS VEGAS SALVAGES some sanity and quits before they lose everything.",48,negative,0.6502187848091125
Great puzzle. Fun theme. Not too hard but still took a second to break in before it clicked.,10,positive,0.9712543487548828
"I had a rapid finish and I thought the construction was clever, but weirdly didn't find completing the puzzle as enjoyable as usual.",1,neutral,0.42082956433296204
A marvelous debut and wise advice from the constructor about sticking with puzzles that involve a bit of solving flexibility. It was great fun to watch theme answers morph into something unexpected. Making tarnation of Tarantino was particularly entertaining. Looking forward to Mr. Guzman's upcoming puzzles.,93,positive,0.9743010997772217

"I really hate these gimmicky puzzles.  I like reasoning to a solution, not guessing.",6,negative,0.899299681186676
"This is the type of puzzle
that will have dozens of
people reporting a solve
without understanding
the theme answers.

Waiting to see how many
of them are proud of that
and how many are disappointed.

I did fill the themers from the
crosses and then, after reading
the revealer, re-read and
understood the themers.

At that point, and only
at that point, did I 
consider the puzzle solved.



YMMV
Your emu may vary too.",15,neutral,0.666558027267456
"I solved it in 19 minutes... but without knowing what I was doing.  I got that it was acronyms, like tarnation for Tarantino, or gloats for 'go last.""  But I didn't bother to figure out what the others were, or what the point of it was. I'd like to see more elegance and consistency  in Thursday puzzles.",5,neutral,0.577675998210907
"I had fun, but the fact that the gimmick answers as typed have no relation to anything in the puzzle (as far as I could tell, and as alluded to in the column) was pretty disappointing. But I always feel good when I crush a Thursday, it doesn't happen every time.",14,negative,0.6100044250488281
