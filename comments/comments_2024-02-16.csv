I finished it without much in the way of real lookups, but I felt it necessary to check my guesses (instead of filling them in and seeing if they contributed enough to crossings to prove them correct).

You're not kidding me with a hair style called ""messy bun""? Come on!--a drink brand called ""Yoohoo""? At least that new term for a trancelike state had to be what filled in and made good sense.

An odd sort of theme/no theme Friday.

Some colorful fill: I liked INNER DEMONS, FOOD COMA, and especially HIGHWAY HYPNOSIS which was new to me.  But then I don't drive.  I loved the clue for NO SHOW (64A).

But there's a really b-a-a-a-a-d POC.  I mean TEAS is unfortunate enough, but to clue it that way...Yikes.

"Nice puzzle and glad to see our new constructor. Not terribly easy for me, of course. Had to do a couple of googles but then it was just working the crosses and it all fell together. Did come in under my Friday average. At least I was able to pick up STYX just from the clue. 

One answer history search today was inspired by HBCU. Looked up MOREHOUSE. Somewhat surprised that it's appeared only twice. Seems like a friendly string of letters.

And... on that note, don't know how many will get this: More than a couple of times in conversations when something about Atlanta's colleges has come up, I always enjoy saying: ""Oh, my wife went to Morehouse."" That always leads to furrowed brows until it finally dawns on them.
