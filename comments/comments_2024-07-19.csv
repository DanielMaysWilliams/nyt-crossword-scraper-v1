Nice TIL for 88888. Is there a compable one? After all people are there permanently though maybe you can't phone them. Which reminds me that I haven't seen comments from our man down there for quite a while.",0,neutral,0.6456208825111389
"My strategy on days like this is make a lot of guesses, make a lot of second guesses, and slowly work things out. I’m in awe of anyone who completes one of these on paper without ripping holes from the erasing. The digital app is my friend!

I got lucky with successful first guesses on GOT A BAD RAP, ITS AN HONOR and EYE DROP, which helped tremendously. The “waft” in “waftaroms” made me think of the squiggly lines, so that made ODOR another successful guess. (Although on second look, “arom” also points to the definition!) In the end, I only had to do 2 lookups, BURPEE and  CANA (that was just for the N; I didn’t know SIENA either), so it was a pretty successful Friday for me.

"This is one of those puzzles that I also had to take breaks and come back. I do believe in allowing the brain to continue to work out a problem without the clutter of  wakeful consciousness (not the right word but don't know what word is best)  getting in the way.  I've used this method most of my life to help learn and remember things in school, work out problems at work, solve emotional dilemmas in relationships, and break through creative slumps.  I slept on this puzzle (figuratively) and when I came back to it this afternoon I easily completed the NE corner to earn the chime of completion. Thank you Deb Amien for your comments today!

"This is a question for @DebAmlen, I hope you see this. It's the second time you've mentioned this phenomenon, and I was wondering (after a short stab at googling with no clear results): Is the benefit of taking a break from a puzzle (or other mental task) the continued working of the brain unconsciously, which is what you mentioned a couple times— or is it kinda the flip side of that? I always thought the Eureka phenomenon, of seeing a different angle when you come back to a puzzle after a break from it, was the *releasing* of the mind from the repeated battering at the task, the *diversion* from or turning off of the attention from it, the *dis*connecting, that allowed one to come back at it refreshed with a fresh start and not remain stuck in whatever ruts one might've been mired in. I've always felt that, when I suddenly see a third possible synonym for a word in a late week puzzle after taking a long break, I've felt that it's because I'm starting kind of raw and fresh instead of trying to build upon preconceptions that I've amassed while in the middle of the previous session. That it was the actual *break* from it that was the benefit, a genuine break... not the mind continuing to churn away at it unrelentingly.

If you have links to support the ""brain doesn't take a break, it's actually still working at it and that's why you get the 'aha' moments"" take on this I'd love to see them! It's interesting either way. Thanks in advance!

"My strategy is generally to go through all the acrosses, filling in anything I know (sometimes penciling in some guesses), then go once through the downs likewise; then go back to the acrosses, and this time when I put something in, look at all the crosses and see if the new letter sparks anything. And I keep going through each set of clues, continuing that policy.

I didn't have a large number of gimmes on the first pass (AVILA, DOVER, ODOR) but things came together relatively quickly, and I was two minutes off my Friday PB, well below my average. This despite a couple of missteps (APE for ANT, JOE for TED).",4,neutral,0.6632012724876404
"With another nod to my misspent youth hanging out in our backyard treehouse during  summer or my comfy pink bedroom in the winter reading oh so many mysteries, NED was a gimme--and for a while the only thing I felt solid about. 

I had confidently plopped in AVILA from the get-go but later lost confidence because I struggled with the crosses. But with VACAY came vindication!  I was so happy to put AVILA back in! 

tinyurl.com/5wd9fatu

A lot of my other early ones had to go, like hard before AGED, get before YER, and IN iT before IN OT. I even had preferences before PROFILE PICS. 

But all in all, I finished it below average and with no lookups or helps! Now that's not exactly a brag, my averages are terrible if you care about time. 

My favorites were SWING STATE, OVEN TIMER, NERO, and LIMOS. 

Another fun puzzle that at first seemed nearly impossible without help but slow and steady won the race!

I don't know that I have a specific strategy but if I do, it involves brain flexibility and willingness to accept that I might be wrong and think of another way to look at it. Even though I really did think it was AVILA, it wasn't serving me at the moment, so I took it out and let my brain flex. For some reason having the V there initially stopped me from seeing VACAY. When I came back to that blank corner as the last section, VACAY just popped into my head... And the rest followed.  Huzzah!!

Happy weekend everyone!",8,positive,0.7217840552330017
"The clues in this one were worth the price of admission. I loved the pair in 10D and 40A (although I agree with David that I would never think of flipping a turkey in the oven -- too risky for my taste).  The clues in the SE corner were very clever too.  My favorite, though, was 29A. I was sure that LITMUS TEST was a gimme, but RPGS in 22D killed that idea. SWING STATE was much nicer, and in tune with SIENA at this point in the political season.

A word about IRATE.  I am IRATE that the beautiful word ""incandescent"" -- which I associate both with warm light and with a smile that could light up the whole world -- has been twisted into meaning IRATE.  Who did this???  Aren't there enough words for angry in our vocabulary?  Shame on you!

More rant coming:  With climate change upon us, I'm afraid that the incandescent bulb must sadly go the way of the rotary phone.  But tell me, ladies:  Would you rather your boyfriend NED had had his first glimpse of you in florescent light...or in LED light...or in halogen light? I rest my case.

And speaking of adding interest, many bravos to Jacob for taking a drab answer – OVEN TIMER – and electrifying it with that scintillating flip-the-bird clue.

Random thoughts:
•  Sweet to see an extremely-rare-in-crosswords six-letter semordnilap (NOTNOW).
• Splendid echo in GAME touching corners with RPGS.
• [Long ride] for LIMO reminded me of another clue for that word that I like: [Something that’s long and steep?].
• Would have been cool if answer #6 (down) – LOVE POTION – would have been #9.

One of the gifts Crosslandia bestows are those moments of astonishment where a word that lay dormant in some brain nook for decades – a word one forgot one knew – joyfully pops out in answer to a clue.  That happened to me three times today, in AVILA, DOVER, and CANA.

BURPEE was a sticking point. Never heard of it in any context besides seeds for the garden I used to have. Finally got it from the crosses. Never had to do that in HS, but I did have to pass a swimming test in order to graduate.

"Pretty smooth but still fun with totally guessable longer fill.  Well done and thanks.  

NW the last to complete as I conflated the patron Saint of headaches and migraines with Mother Teresa who I knew to be Albanian.  

Speaking of migraines, following the developing story of worldwide IT outages affecting systems running a Cloudstrike Falcon sensor security product.  Apparently a corrupted update file is causing the dreaded BSOD* (which would be a debut answer).

"I love a difficult Friday puzzle that is still very fair and doable. I somehow knew 15D was DOONE, confirmed by DOVER at the crossing. However, researching this after I finished the puzzle was very interesting.

Similarly, I now know what a dahabeah is and how many jeons equal a WON.

No idea why I thought small-time stakes were petty instead of PENNYANTE 🤪.

Finished quicker than usual but got a good mental boost. 

Obrigada!",19,positive,0.9481310248374939
Just two lookups so that's my Friday record. Should have maybe stuck with it for a bit longer. Might have gotten it eventually. Had Cooper's test like some others here also and that had me confused. Over here that's what is part of the tests. Did not know the term LOLLS.,16,neutral,0.7361011505126953
"What a fun puzzle. 
Helps it's my first time ever completing a Friday puzzle with zero help from the article / Google, all in under 50 minutes. Great feeling! 
Thank you constructor",30,positive,0.9801207184791565
"Well, this was fun for the most part, but had me really confused for a long while - it turns out I've been spelling GOT A BAD RAP wrongly as BAD REP this whole time! It didn't help that I assumed the New Testament miracle location was CAVE rather than CANA, so thanks to that one spot I almost WENT BANANAS. Still, had a great time and I loved some of the clues!",20,negative,0.4384859800338745
I recall learning waftaroms from a visual dictionary of esoteric terms; the flying sweat droplets that show someone is nervous are called plewds.,13,neutral,0.7656827569007874
"First, I want to apologize for last week's threads potatogate. Hopefully the following food fact will make up for it: in Australia they have something called ""the lot"", which you can order your burger with - the usual stuff, then bacon, egg, so far so good, and ... pineapple and beets.",7,positive,0.5647371411323547
"Of course I confidently put SIENA in for St Teresa's birthplace at 1A, but thankfully I knew that was wrong when 36A rolled around and I more confidently put SIENA there. What's another five-letter Italian city?",5,neutral,0.5958914160728455

I always thought Burpee was the effect of the exercise.,12,neutral,0.8725374341011047
"IT'S (truly) AN HONOR, and I want to thank the crossword gods for this award I'm giving myself, for having completed a Friday with just one lookup, which was really just a quick peek at a map to confirm that my instinct was right about BALI.

The reason I needed the confirmation was because I had Cooper instead of BURPEE (who I didn't even dream was an actual person.)
Between you and me, I'm glad it wasn't Cooper because of what happened at my high-school after he came for a lecture. 
The Headmaster lost his marbles and instituted an obligatory Cooper Test at the start of every semester, and I had to complete 7.5 laps around a soccer field in 12 minutes and in scorching Summer heat. 
And then, I  had no doubt he'd really lost his marbles when he said that for us Seniors, not passing the test would result in not being able to graduate. 
Well, the sleeping rebel in me would not have it, and ran 7 laps and stopped, despite there being plenty of time for the last half lap. 
Long story short, yes, I graduated. 
And the rebel in me went back into permanent sleep. 
And I never, ever, went jogging ever again. 

This is the first time I've thought of this (pseudo) trauma in 46 years, and I know I'm over it because it didn't detract at all from this  amazing solving experience.

And since I've given my own self an award, I would also like thank Jacob McDermott for making it possible.
Sir, IT'S always AN HONOR and a pleasure to solve a puzzle of yours! Thank you!",41,positive,0.8640846610069275

"I recently learned what the Murph challenge is and was so excited to see 48-Across...On the bright side, MURPHY and BURPEE have enough letters in common that it was still helpful for the down clues!",8,positive,0.9599723815917969
"A puzzle that was best approached like a grasshopper, jumping on gimmes and renovating them when they were wrong, using crosses to clear the debris, and generally just letting the puzzle help me solve it. A few head scratchers (IOT, for instance, which I initially filled in as ""tie""), but nothing to seriously halt the progress and spoil the fun.

I liked your puzzle, Jacob, and look forward to many more.",18,neutral,0.5578650832176208
"Bad memories of ‘six count burpees’…

Ran through the across clues and was stuck until the bottom right corner.  Filled the puzzle in backwards from there…. 25% faster than my average for a Friday…",6,negative,0.7571192979812622
"“What might prompt you to flip the bird” was the clue of the week for me!

Did not know BURPEE was a person. Don’t like him now. 

I am a Korean but “100 jeon” is an unfair clue. I am a Korean and I don’t think jeon was used in the last 50 years. It is equivalent to 1/1000 cent. The word may exist but the money does not. My two jeons. 

Lastly a shout out to Sienna Saints where I spent a year in my twenties!",60,negative,0.7583474516868591

"Fun puzzle that turned out to be a bottom up solve and only took one third my usual Friday time.  I see many 'on the same wavelength' comments which certainly applies, as well as 'not much on the first pass'.",10,positive,0.9150475859642029
"I consider myself an intermediate solver - during the summers crosswords are a daily diversion.  I have typically gotten stuck on Friday puzzles, but I completed my fasted  Friday puxxle ever (11:46! ) . I thought many clues were unique  - things I never saw before.  I agree - nothing ""unlocked"" easily for me on this one, and I  stayed in the ""challenged but not frustrated"" zone.  I  think I had success as a result of consistent practice over the past few weeks - this was a good training puzzle.",17,positive,0.7244048118591309
"Loved it. It felt impossible at first, but slowly came into focus. That’s a sign of a great puzzle, IMHO. 

I appreciated the “Roman” gimme.",39,positive,0.9772878885269165
Great flow to this. A nice steady engaging quarter hour tonight. Always felt like I was working but never frustrated.,14,positive,0.9762770533561707
"Fun puzzle!   TIL ""waftaroms"".
Not much trivia and it was guess-able from crosses.   Had to think about a lot of clues but some just popped into my head.  Some pops were even useful. ""Cooper"" (thank you 1968's Aerobics) instead of BURPEE was not!  Thanks for a nice start to the weekend.",7,positive,0.9477046728134155

"I remember BURPEES from some unpleasant school compulsory fitness tests - of course I always thought they were named for the lurching motion involved.

TIL it was a person, so I looked him up. His first name was Royal!

So tell me: what would a ROYAL BURPEE be?
a) Like a regular burpee, but you have to perform them in front of royalty.
b)  Like a regular burpee, but you receive royalties for every ten you complete.
c) Like a regular burpee, but someone else does them on your behalf while you watch.
