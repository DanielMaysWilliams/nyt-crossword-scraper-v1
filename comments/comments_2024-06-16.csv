"Years ago, I was traveling on a dirt road in the Southern Laos country side. Our driver and guide were in the front seat, my companion and I in the back. We stopped as a pair of water buffalo crossed the road. I asked my guide, ‚Äòwhy did the water buffalo cross the road?‚Äô He shrugged and I let him know the answer, ‚Äòto get to the other side!‚Äô  He and the driver could not stop laughing for the remainder of the drive.  A variation on an old joke for us was new and hysterical for them.",36,neutral,0.676101803779602
"I enjoyed the puzzle, but it brought back memories of puzzles in which the words listed spelled out different sentences. themes  or names.  Haven't seen anything like that in a long time.

Enjoy being puzzled and Happy Father's Day to dads - past, present and expecting.",5,positive,0.7438302636146545
"The first parts of the theme answers (the ‚Äúconnection‚Äù) were step one. But then step two wasn‚Äôt apparent to me right away (what would come after that word).

"This was more of a success for me than some of the Connections puzzles I've played (I do get most of them) so it was nice to see this type of cluing in a regular crossword. I had more trouble with show-biz names than with the themers, which is typical for me.

It was still a lot of fun and didn't take too much longer than my usual Sunday, and I was more worried that the internet was going to stay out after we lost it during a very heavy rainstorm, but it came back up long before the rain actually stopped. No water problems here, unlike southern Florida, fortunately.

Nice puzzle, ladies, and hopefully we'll see some more collabs in the future.",13,positive,0.9581362009048462
"Finally got my seven day streak. The theme was pretty obvious, though the second half of each answer took me a few go arounds to get.

After about 35 minutes, I was down to two clues left. ORR_S/S_S_/_OLANI. I figured it had to be vowel in the first spot and consonant in the second. Unwilling up give up my streak, I tried all 126 vowel/consonant combinations. None of them worked. I stared it for a another minute then tried two Is for ORRIS/SISI/IOLANI. It worked. 7 day streak",50,positive,0.4924778640270233
"‚ÄúFail-safe,‚Äù originally military jargon, entered general parlance in 1962 with the publication of the novel Fail-Safe by Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler, which was made into a movie. The title describes the command system used by the Strategic Air Command. In an alert, SAC bombers fly to a position (called the ‚Äúfail-safe point‚Äù) where they circle until they receive a command to proceed to their targets in the Soviet Union. After a set period of time and absent the order to attack, they return to their bases. In the words of a fictional General Bogan, who is explaining things to a fictional Congressman Raskob, ‚ÄúFail-Safe simply means that if something fails it is still safe.‚Äù In other words, a fail-safe system is not guaranteed not to fail; it is designed to cause no harm when it does.",36,neutral,0.8763617277145386

"Love Connections, enjoyed this easy solve, except for that tricky spot Caitlin points out. Luckily my guesses for 34D and 50A worked out...whew. Thanks, Chandi and Wyna!",3,positive,0.975437343120575
"(I don't think there's any way to play archived Connections games, but in case there is one I'm unaware of, I'll say SPOILER ALERT in advance.)


*****


It's interesting to note that although Connections has various ways to group ideas (for example, a puzzle from six months ago had BUNKER, FAIRWAY, GREEN and ROUGH as ""Golf course parts""; ENOUGH, STOP, MERCY and UNCLE for ""I give""; BAWDY, BLUE, COARSE and RISQUE for ""Indecent""; and DOUGH, BOUGH, COUGH and TOUGH for ""--Ough words that don't rhyme.""

All of the quartets in today's Crossword are in the format "" --- (word)"", which is another common type of group.  In other words, in a regular Connections game, the category for the words in 22A would be titled ""--- STORE"".

The clever part of the puzzle is that the word for each first word is different in the solution:  (STORE) FRONTS, (SEASON) OPENERS, (TEAM) LEADERS, etc.  


On another note, I'd like to thank my niece for having ACL surgery about a month ago.  This allowed me to see BRACE for ""Boot"" almost immediately.  She'll be here for Father's Day, so I'll let you know how she's healing.

I count eight different synonyms for ""something that comes first"", and each phrase is an in-the-language expression.",18,neutral,0.5146061778068542
"This was excellent! Great theme. A tad on the easy side - 11 minutes better than my average, even after I spent a minute finding my typo. 
I love Sundays.",6,positive,0.9828702807426453
"So I see that Wyna has the Mini, the main crossword, and presumably, when it drops at 3 a.m., Connections the game (as opposed to Connections the Sunday crossword).  That makes a trifecta, or a hat trick (both good things to know for a solver).

I wonder if anyone has had three puzzles published on the same day before, or is this a record?

Caitlin?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Bueller?",31,positive,0.5367394685745239
