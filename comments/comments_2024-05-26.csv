I believe the last time it was clued otherwise was on 2/15/2009, when the clue was, ‚ÄúFox News anchor Pemmaraju‚Äù. Prior to that you have to go back to 3/21/1993 when the clue was, ‚ÄúFringefoot‚Äù, a type of lizard (also clued like that 10 times previously throughout the 70‚Äôs and as far back as 1967). Between 1942 and 1953 it was clued 5 times as today to the Hindu goddess. The first time the actress was the clue was 5/2/1990, ‚ÄúActress Thurman of ‚ÄòDangerous Liasons‚Äô‚Äù. a movie made in 1988 when she was just 18 years old. Of note, she appeared on the covers of British ‚ÄúVogue‚Äù when even younger in 1985 and 1986. It anyone wonders about the connection between the actress‚Äôs name and today‚Äôs clue I suspect it has to do with her father Robert, who was a former Tibetan Buddhist monk and my professor of Eastern Religions at Amherst when I was a Freshman there in the 70‚Äôs.

But the answer that made me chuckle was BLAST FROM THE PAST.  It's both simpler and more subtle than the other themers -- and there was a delicious moment when I went back to re-read the clue... and then the joke belatedly landed.

One quibble though, strictly speaking STROPS only hone a razor, they don't sharpen it.

And today the wit combined with the twinkle in the eye continues.  Everyday phrases reimagined by taking a word meaning ‚Äúinsult‚Äù, and using one of its other definitions to marvelous effect.  

What makes the theme answers sparkle is not only the wordplay, but their clues ‚Äì funny, right on the mark.  Clues made by an artist, IMO.

Plus, this is one of those themes where the cat is out of the bag after the first theme answer, leaving six more to try to guess with as few letters filled in as possible ‚Äì something my brain relishes.

"Talk about BURNAFTERREADING...or, in my case, slightly BURNed.

Im talking about 'The Unbearable Lightness of Being' by Milan Kundera. 
That's the book my then boyfriend was referring to when he told me he'd started on a great read.

A month later, I found it atop my bed, where my father would place books he recommended.

It was a painful read. Boring. Uninspiring. But I pushed through to the end. After all, both my boyfriend and father had obviously liked it. And it was a worldwide best-seller.

When I was finished, I went first to my boyfriend.
""I'm mystified. You liked that book?"" I asked, sheepishly.
""Oh, I didn't,"" he replied, ""I stopped reading it before the second chapter.""

I then went to my father, with the same question, only to receive the exact same answer.
""Well, then why did you leave it for me to read?"" 
I was irritated.
He, non-chalantly, looked me in the eye and replied, ""Because I didn't want to throw it away.""
