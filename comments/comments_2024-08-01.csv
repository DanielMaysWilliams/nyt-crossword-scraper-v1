"I LOVED THIS PUZZLE!

I got ripped abs first and didn’t get what it meant for awhile, until i realized it said to make the clues make sense, not the answer.  Getting the trick was so deeply satisfying, and then as i got each subsequent clue’s answer i had an awesome thrill as they fell into place each time.  I liked how even getting the trick i had to think for awhile to get the answer, and needed some of the crosses for help.  Baby Talk was the last one I got, because I kept reading it with the emphasis on ‘by’ rather than ‘talk,’ so getting ORALLY actually made me understand the clue itself.

Also loved how lots of the other fill required a lot of thought, I had to not be too precious with my answers and erase and retry things until it all puzzled together.  It took me a pretty long time and a break in between but no lookups and no cheats, which made this extra satisfying.  Great debut!!",9,positive,0.8594151139259338
"Here's a thought about the ""taking a break helps"" meme.

It is absolutely true that sometimes one needs to walk away for a bit.

It *might* be that we unconsciously work on it while resting.

I think it might, alternatively, mean that we free our minds of mental ruts.  For example, in this one, a clue included radius.  I can't help but think of high school math, and could only search my mind for an answer in math.  

By being away for a while, one might forget that rut, and realize there are other meanings of radius.

Our minds get primed.  If you ask a person what the colors of the chess pieces are, and then ask them to name an animal, ""zebra"" or ""orca"" will come up much more frequently than if you don't ask the question about chess pieces.",9,neutral,0.774982213973999
"I was told there wouldn't be any math . . . or typography.

Somehow, I managed to get the puzzle done before heading off to work this morning; but only getting back to column and comments now.

Now, I'm not gonna scream ""Unfair!' or ""Do better!"", but it was a weak theme paired with some iffy clues for the theme entries: RIPPED ABS--as in ""ripped out""?   Well, yes, but that's a stretch. [B--y talk]=ORALLY? I mean, I suppose I can come up with a ""substitution"": ""I will give you the directions orally"" vs. ""I will give the directions by talk--wait, I mean 'by talking'."" (Insert youtube clip here--is that  kite or a weaver next to him? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=291ET6Py6H8)

But even nastier was 17A: you need to know what an ""exponent"" is, and what a ""caret"" is (and that it's not a ""cabaret""), and then know that exponents are sometimes written using a caret, when a superscript isn't available.

I finally figured out the trick when I got EMAILS and had no idea why. Also had PONZI SCHEMES and EXPONENTS and didn't know why... The lower level crossings were a bit harder for me so I didn't have enough crossings yet to figure out BELOW THE BELT (and not know why)...  and I wasn't trusting ??ALLY at all and I was afraid I wouldn't get the trick figured out... 

But just like earlier today when I tricked my boss out of my favorite spot at our meeting table after he got there first and then mocked me for being slow (all in very good fun!), I persevered and reclaimed my spot! Nobody messes with HeathieJ when her favorite spot is on the line! 💪😂

Likewise, I lasered in on the clue that resulted in EMAILS and on the revealer....  and huzzah, just like that, I got it. Pretty quickly was able to parse out BELOW THE BELT once I RIPPED out those ABS, laughed at the ""Baby talk"" clue, and filled in the O and R.

"What a cleverly constructed theme! As soon as I filled in the revealer things started to make sense. I love the feeling when that happens.

The only sticky part for me was the NE corner. Once I realized ""kite"" and ""weavers"" were birds, it suddenly made sense. Excellent misdirection in those clues!",13,positive,0.9627169370651245

"Here’s a constructor who, in her debut, shows great promise.  Somewhere along the line, Rajeswari came across the phrase RIPPED ABS and didn’t just move on; her brain tapped her on the shoulder and said, “Look closer!”  That’s crossword constructor brain.  She’s got it.

And she delivered.  A bit into the puzzle, when I had uncovered one of the theme answers and knew it was correct, even though it didn’t fit its clue – well, that is one of Crosslandia’s great moments: where you know there’s a riddle to crack and an aha coming when you do.  It brings a bounce to your brain’s step.  I actually thought, “Oh I love this puzzle” at that moment.

Rajeswari sweetened the outing with beauty as well: MIDGE, PONZI SCHEMES, PLUMB, POLE CAR, BELOW THE BELT, RIPPED ABS, BLEEP, IMPOSTER.  Plus, she included lovely vague clues and misdirects.  

So yes, great promise evident here, IMO.

Two observations.  First, I’m amazed that BELOW THE BELT had never appeared in a Times puzzle before today.  Second, regarding RIDGY, which has drawn some raised eyebrows, well, I love this answer.  It looks terrific, is fun to say, and has far more bounce than “ridged”.  I’ve never thought of it before, never used it, and maybe never will, but I love it – thumbs up!

Rajeswari, congratulations on becoming a Times constructor, and please, forge on!  Thank you for your splendid puzzle!",27,positive,0.8772023320198059
"Darlin' Deb, 

I gave up girding my loins about the time it became harder to reach them.

PS: I know you just meant to be humerus, but the radius is either 'a bone...' or 'one of the bones' that runs from wrist to ELBOW. Hate to break up a good bony comment, but that's my knit and I'm sticking to it.

"Thank you Ms. Rajamani for a great debut puzzle. Congratulations, it must be a thrill to be chosen for publication. 

I really enjoyed this puzzle. It was challenging at times. I thought it was a rebus at first.  I had to check the wordplay column to get the trick in order to finish. It never occurred to me that the clue would have the missing letters! A real twist for me. My last fill was 16A. I don't know this word, so will look it up later. I didn't understand some of the unstarred clues, but was able to fill correctly with crosses and guessing. There may be a generation gap. I'm old and often don't know newer words used in slang or conversationally. In any case, it slows me up, but doesn't knock me out. Great fun and I have a wonderful sense of accomplishment finishing a Thursday puzzle.

"Wonderful debut. Particularly liked:

The adjoining misdirect bird clues in the NE corner for weavers and kites. And weavers' nests really are amazingly intricate.

The tragi-comic mini story of the man-eating ogre who has (orally) eaten someone's flower-girl niece, and once she's consumed and entirely below the belt, so to speak, the ogre feels rather sleepy and filled with ennui. He lists on his feet, then crashes face-forward to the ground, exposing his uber-arse, ridgy with warts and zits. 

The tragi-comic mini story of all the exponents of ponzi schemes you see via media all the time, which only a sloppy myope couldn't spot as one brazen lie after another, like those promises of ripped abs, if you'll buy this lifetime supply of whey, or those emails advising you to smoke all the pot you want, guzzle Mtn Dew, Moet, Mules, until you're orally sated, and then, when your gut looks like an uber-bulb, go get a lipo, only $499.99!! Ripped Abs 4-Life!

I'd prefer ""Middle road"" or ""Middle way"" for VIA MEDIA, as the term is slightly more active & forward-moving than ""middle ground"" implies. RIDGY is the only clunker in an otherwise elegant, cheery grid. Ridged, perhaps. Are the Appalachians extremely ridgy? Did you forego your evening walk because it was too midgy?  Is that endoskeleton very Muybridgy? Is your copy of Tropic of Cancer with the sex scenes clipped out really so abridgy? Did Goldilocks find it all too porridgy? No. But my six-pack abs are, indeed, quite ridgy (LIE).",34,positive,0.8734617829322815
"I couldn't see what was supposed to be happening, so I filled in the puzzle (one look-up, a proper name) with words that fit and sometimes seemed to be related to the clues (ELBOW was very cool), got the fanfare, and was done.

F-ULOUS debut! Really enjoyed this!,26,positive,0.9888696670532227
"Congratulations on a stellar debut, Raji! Very impressive how quickly you got here.
 
I tend to skip around the puzzle, building from what I know, which led me to the revealer early on. 
Still, I didn't know if it would be a rebus until the theme answers started filling in nicely, as complete words, but not making sense. That's when I checked the clues.

Putting the trick in the clues is such a creative idea that i never get tired of it.

It's a bit of a shame that, to the detriment of this excellent trick, yesterday's puzzle also had us looking twice at the clues themselves. In other words, I was somewhat primed for it.

And yet, that didn't take away from the joyful romp through this grid replete with clever, fresh, and rich fill. It didn't give rise to any ENNUI and, as a MYOPE, I feel seen.

As for RIDGY, some might not love it, but, of course, it's a word in its own right. Me, I've always thought of curdoroys as RIbbed, so I actually tried RIbbY. 
Well, compared to RIbbY, RIDGY comes as a relief!

Thank you so much for this engaging puzzle, Raji!",14,positive,0.8354548811912537
"Bytalk = ORALLY? 

Can anyone explain this clue for me? 

Not familiar with the term Bytalk. Hard to find a definition online. Maybe defined as “trivial conversation”? That doesn’t seem to solve to ORALLY, in my mind, but I’m sure I’m missing something.",10,negative,0.5048603415489197
"Oh thiiiiiiis is what it would feel like if Saturdays had themes.  I truly had to make a concerted effort to get onto the same wave with the constructor to finish this one out.  Once I did the answers (correct ones this time!) started to fall into place.  

The revealer was actually the easiest section for me to tackle (and I needed it!).  PacECAR and pAt instead of POLECAR and DAB had me all over the place in that area.  It didn't help that I initially thought of ""radius"" mathematically and was thinking casino or pinball for the bad hit.  Ah me, I'm just glad I got it done.",11,positive,0.615078866481781

The AVIAN corner with its weavers and kites is fabulous. Also a fun clue for IDIOM.

"The Dutch word for glove is similar to German, ""handschoen."" 

We lived in the Netherlands for a couple of years when my daughters were school age. Our 4-year-old told us this joke: ""In wat voor schoenen stopt Sinterklaas niet cadeautjes in? Handschoenen!""

"The Mini begs to question: ""Word that, in German, translates directly to 'hand shoe'.""

Spoiler: the answer is GLOVE.

This is baloney. ""Glove"" is not a German word. What the constructor(s) seemed to be trying to get at is the idea that there is a German word that means ""hand-shoe"" when translated to English. Here's the word...

Handschuh
Definition. The word “Handschuh” literally translates into English as “hand-shoe” and means “glove”. “Handschuh” can refer to any type of glove worn on the hands, from ordinary winter gloves to surfing gloves to surgical gloves.

The clue is way, way off base to get the answer desired. Who's doing the Mini clues these days? There were one or two yesterday that were other than accurate.",3,neutral,0.6347158551216125

I liked the clues for ICERINK and ELBOW, and as a birder especially enjoyed like a kite for AVIAN. During the last couple of years when I was living bicoastally and spending a few months a year in San Diego, one of the joys of being on the left coast was being able to walk to a park where I could often see white tailed kites.
