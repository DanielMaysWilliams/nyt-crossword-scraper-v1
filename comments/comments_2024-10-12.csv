"Congratulations Katie Hoody for a lovely Saturday debut here in the NYT.  I enjoyed the puzzle. I had great fun with all six stacks and with just a few crosses was able to fill them in easily.  Which was good because some of the crosses were harder for me than the stacks. Like IRL and MOS.  But this is a Saturday crosswords and we must accept the CCCP and SELENITES or otherwise it would be a Wednesday puzzle. Two that I looked up.  TIL them which gives me great pleasure.

No look-ups, happy music on the first try, but an amazing number of the clue meanings I got only in retrospect.

[Banging my head on the wall] When o' when will I remember that the letters on anything that is obviously something that's old Russian will be CCCP, not USSR! Ugh! That and having reduce instead of DECOCT, not knowing the brother's name at 21A, and having way more Star Trek knowledge than Star Wars, not knowing LA museums, and safe going down, instead of CAME... really made it hard for me to wrap this one up. 

And that's okay, despite a few little clues that I agree with the constructor and others weren't great, the majority were solid and enjoyable—I just didn't get some of them, and my frustration is myself. I've got to remember CCCP! I really think if I'd had that down right, and didn't feel so confident with USSR, I could have puzzled out the rest.

But here are a few ""x for y"" clues for SYN that have been used before (all with ""Abbr."" tags):

Money for bread; Lacking, for short; Individual, for one; United, for one; Illustration, for example; Looks for ganders; Specimen, for example; Case, for example; Loads, for many; Example, for instance; Abridged, for short; and Single, for one, which ironically was the only one used twice.  

For the full word SYNONYM as the answer, we also have had Contracts for shrinks; United, for one; and Instance, for example, which apparently was the first time (2007) this kind of clue was used. With just a little variance, we also have: Try to stab and Lay to rest.

When the answer is SYNS, the ""for"" becomes ""and"":  Terms and conditions; Destiny and fate; Warm and toasty; Aid and abet; Bits and pieces.  We also have seen Prim and proper for the full word SYNONYMS.

I assumed that _UDs referred to some chemical abbreviation, like PCPs (Although I was pretty sure that intrauterine devices were not used in oil-drilling). Which gave the possibility of almost any consonant. So I ran the alphabet--or rather the QWERTY, as I find it more ergonomically efficient; and since the last letter on the QWERTY is ""M""--well, I then realized that the lubricants were the quite common(-noun) MUDS, and that I had not been in Natick at all, but rather the Village of Ignorance. 

But Caitlin's lead photo of Anna Magnani lead me down the wiki-rabbit hole of Roberto Rosselini""s (Isabella's father) film adaptation of *La Voix Humaine*--based on dramatic monologue by Jean Cocteau, which also spawned an opera by Francis Poulenc. *La Voix Humaine was included in anthology film titled *L'Amore*, which, in a second segment, also starred--in an acting role--a young Federico Fellini.

Finally, BRAWL made me think of all the great Donnybrook scenes from the Canadian sitcom *Letterkenny*--no great youtubes of them, tho, so instead here's the Donnybrook from John  Ford's *The Quiet Man*(1952), starring Maureen O'Hara and, in an uncharacteristic role, John Wayne:

"GEE WHIZ!
A debut?

Well, methinks there are many feeling
we’re in a HONEYMOON PHASE with you, Katie.

Though with your constructing chops, 
we may never get beyond it.

Love the inclusion of DOS.
My youngest is interviewing for residencies 
as a DO in internal meds.

Loved this tough, brilliant puzzle.

"now THIS is a proper Saturday crossword 😊

What a great accomplishment of construction...and a NYT debut at that! I needed just a couple of lookups to jumpstart the solve, as there were quite a few obscure (for me) factoids. Once the eggshell was cracked a bit, this puzzle was delightfully evil yet fair. Thank you Katie...let this not be your last late week puzzle.",16,positive,0.9694632887840271

Four 15 letter debuts, and one other that only appeared in one previous puzzle. And all of them quite familiar terms.That's just... incredible.

"Excellent debut, Katie.  I was shocked to see that this was a debut due to the high quality.  This is exactly what I look for in a Saturday puzzle.  First pass, almost nothing.  Picking up a few on the next pass, then slowly building to a completed grid.  

[Zest for life: Abbr.]  was such a great clue for SYN.  I got it from the crosses, and when I saw it, I groaned.  We've seen clues like that before, and I tell myself I won't get fooled again, but here we are.",27,positive,0.9309992790222168

"Uncomfortably far out of my wheelhouse. I appreciate all of the commenters here owning up to the clues they had trouble with because I was DOA. After 20 minutes I had a smattering of non-connecting clues filled in and acres of grid left to SEED.

First, the blog. Lots of help there.

Then, the comments thread.

Even then, I’m befuddled with MUDS and CHE and CEES (aren’t there a pair of ESSES also), and nothing popped into my head at the spanning clues (all six of them) as sometimes, rarely, maybe on a Monday I guess, happens.

Obviously indicative of a broken streak, though my “solved” streak of 2,316 remains intact.

A real stumper.

Kudos.",18,neutral,0.510789155960083

"Nope.  

Too much for me.

I had biaS for 23A, and none of the three downs helped with the first wrong letters *at all*.  I never could understand Lovecraft.  These gigantic, ten-story monsters who somehow manage to live off nothing more than the occasional human.  It's be like me going a year on a chicken wing.

"First pass, nada.  Second pass, maybe three fills. Started to feel like a trivia game instead of a crossword. Finally rattled the cage, and amazingly, it started to fill up from the bottom.  Went back up to the top, armed with the knowledge that the long fills were really straightforward, and the HONEYMOON started to unfold.

This was some debut!  Good for you, Katie Hoody.  (Bet we'll be seeing more of you.)  Thank you!",47,positive,0.5703107118606567
"Over the years, my feelings about stacks of grid spanners have evolved from ""they're intimidating"" to ""they're intimidating but they are almost always well-known phrases and once you have a few letters you might be able to guess what they are and then they are actually of great help for the difficult short words that cross them"". 

I felt like a very bad Slav because I got both RUS and BIALY on crossings and had never heard of either of them - but then I read that even Andrzej didn't know the latter and I feel better. As a Southern Slav, I feel very excluded by the ""Lech, Czech and Rus"" legend. What brother am I a descendant of?",22,neutral,0.5488872528076172

"I enjoyed this puzzle with it's quite fresh and inventive clues. However, I needed quite a few lookups for the trivia and the mysterious word for BRAWL, donnybrook. It has a nice ring to it, I hope I will be able to remember it.

There are three things I don't understand. It would be nice if the community explained them to me.

Polish roll: BIALY??? I'm Polish and have no idea what's going on here. ""Biały"" is Polish for ""white"" (masculine version; feminine would be ""biała"" and neuter ""białe""). ""Biały"" on its own only means a white person. ""Roll"" implies something bread-related, maybe? ""Białe pieczywo"" is the cheapest, least healthy type of bread over here, and it can be represented by both loaves and rolls. A roll is ""bułka"", and it's feminine, so it would be BIAŁA. I'm really confused by this entry...

Zest for life: Abbr. SYN? Syn. is short for what, exactly?

Approaches, briefly: MOS? I only know mos. as months.",21,positive,0.8607134819030762

"For once, the spanners came to me quickly and the shorter ones often had me stumped. It was an unusual mix that I thoroughly enjoyed.",37,positive,0.9256303906440735
"As I began to go through THIS puzzle, my first thought was, THAT’SIMPOSSIBLE.  Sadly, however, that thought did not immediately tip me off to the answer to 1A.  The combination 6 grid spanners and a plethora of general knowledge clues that were outside my ken, had me flummoxed for the longest while.  To top it off, boldly putting in bean for chickpea, instead of SEED, made it very hard to see SUCKSWIND.  And as if all that wasn’t enough to induce despair, I had not one but two typos to ferret out at the very end.  This was a great challenge for me, and balanced out yesterday’s easy cruise.  A HAT tip to the constructor for a wild ride with a satisfying ending.

Seeing DESE in the puzzle reminded me of one of my mother’s favorite stories about my childhood.  I was 3 or 4 and we were visiting some family friends who had a boy a couple of years older than me. Apparently (I have no actual memory of the events in question, but know the story only through repetitive tellings) my erstwhile playmate had trouble making the TH sound and was saying dis and dat.  I piped up and said, “Mom, Bruce is a dis, dat, dese and dose boy,” causing my beleaguered mother no end of embarrassment. It seems I was born to be a word pedant.",26,negative,0.7385626435279846

I can't believe that we're at a stage in crosswords where debuts feature two 3 entry stacks. I've tried making a crossword with just one 3-entry stack and it was grueling. I cannot imagine doing 2 in a debut puzzle. Amazing work. Definitely one of the year's highlights for me so far.,71,positive,0.9208271503448486
"I should know better than to do the Saturday puzzle while watching a baseball game; in this case, the final game of the Dodgers-Padres series to determine whom my Mets will play next week.  

It took me way above my average, although I realize that it probably wasn't anywhere near as hard as it seemed to be while I was doing.  The top half was impenetrable for the half-paying attention me and the bottom half was slow but doable.  

Many of my eventually correct answers were wild guesses, like RUS for the Slavic lore character, and ETUDES because Lizst.  URIAH was deep cut Old Testament, but with that initial U, was a fair guess (and of course, UGH was a good guess, too!)

Some of my missteps included being sure that the LA museum was the GEHRY instead of the GETTY (again, just not paying enough attention); the former, of course, was the architect who created many structures in LA and elsewhere.  Also, ANTARCTIC finally came to me with several crosses already in.  I had ON SHOW instead of ON VIEW for a while, and BRB for the text abbreviation.  

In the end, IT TAKES A VILLAGE opened up the top for me, and the other two spanners up there were in fairly quickly.

And the Dodgers won the game, if anyone cares.",18,neutral,0.663284182548523
