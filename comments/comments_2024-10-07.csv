When my husband and I started going out he once lent me the book ‚ÄòTime And Again‚Äô to read when the choir I accompanied was on tour and we‚Äôd be apart! It‚Äôs a great SciFi novel set in mid 1800‚Äôs Manhattan. I wonder if the constructors ever heard of it. Please keep warm this Winter in Winnipeg!,2,positive,0.8872047662734985

"Is a puzzle that finds a word that goes with both sides of a two-word phrase twice as good as one that goes with only one side of a two-word phrase?

No.  I'd say it's at least four times as good.  It's certainly at least four times as hard for a constructor to come up with.

This puzzle takes a TEPID puzzle-type that I have always found dull as dishwater and elevates it to something eminently respectable.  And while it wasn't an especially exciting puzzle to solve, I tip my hat to its smoothness and even more to its density of theme answers.  Nice job.",12,positive,0.7118300199508667

"How puzzles--and puzzle entries--have changed since I was a wee imp, working them at my Mother's knee! Obviously, the inclusion of computer lingo (ESC) and textspeak (SRSLY), but also the increasing multi-culturalism of America ([Carne] ASADA).

But less common now are those flocks of sea birds, Latin numerals--although usually with some math involved, e.g. [CLXVII x VI]--and especially clues of the type [Surname and Surname]=PLURAL GIVEN NAMES. Their inclusion in a puzzle some people might find DATED, but I find a sentimental PERIOD PIECE.

Finally, and sentimentally, although it doesn't fit the theme *exactly*--the second word is wrong--anyone fortunate enough to be tuned into NBC on November 28, 1985 witnessed this exquisite moment in pop music; the youtube clip of which I can watch TIME AND TIME AGAIN:

"Bit of a workout for a Monday but a very enjoyable puzzle. And.. wondered if this kind of theme had been done before and stumbled across a similar puzzle from September 6, 2011 by Susan Gelfand. DOUBLETIME was the reveal in that one and the theme answers were:

TRAVELCARD
TRIALPERIOD
ZONEOUT
and
SLOTMACHINE

And then... DOUBLETIME led this ex-GI down a different path and I found an appropriate puzzle from Monday December 6, 1999 by Gregory E. Paul. The reveal answer in that one was: COMMAND, and the other theme answers were:

"I finished today's puzzle rather quickly but I did not get my gold star. In the end I found the error - I had IOwA rather than IOnA. The thing is, I know virtually no US sports team names, and the one golfer I have learned about is an amateur and probably not much of a golfer at all. I have noticed though that very often the teams are called by their state or city. So here was a team for which I had IO_A, and it crossed with a golfer's name. IOwA was the only thing that made sense to me, and I did not pay much attention to ARwIE - I just assumed it was a somewhat strange surname of a guy whose parents named him Palmer. I've seen way stranger surnames in these puzzles in the past!

"Ah time, the one thing I wish I had more of (except this afternoon watching ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" with my wife, both of us simultaneously declaring to each other we've never seen a more garbled, unfunny POS in our lives, and wished it was over sooner). It's providential, in this fine Monday puzzle, that there are other ""time"" phrases found in the grid that are relevant to my life, at least, to wit:

LAMAR TIME
Anyone who watched Lamar Jackson today throw the prettiest last second touchdown pass ever seen, propelling his Ravens to victory, now knows about LAMAR TIME. It turns a Steelers fan such as myself ice cold.

MOCHA TIME comes at dawn, after a bad night caused by your sleep apnea. All hail MOCHA TIME.

TIME SHANKS
Referees make them at the worst possible moments in important games, mistakenly subtracting precious seconds from the game clock, for example. But if you say that the American Revolution succeeded the French Revolution, that's also a TIME SHANK.

Oh, here's one that can be added to the themers: AIR FLOW; I see that creep is getting a lot of AIR TIME now that the election is around the corner, and FLOW TIME is the time it takes to complete a task, it's a common enough phrase...when I hit a TIME SNAG, as is often the case, it definitely slows down my flow time.
