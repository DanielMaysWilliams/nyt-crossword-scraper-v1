"My first Wednesday solve with absolutely no assists, and it’s only 6:45 am. I have a job interview later today. Can I ride this high through till then? I feel unstoppable now, hehe :D",63,positive,0.9826902747154236
"Hi! I’ve been doing crosswords for about four-five months, and I know it’s a cliche, and I’ve never commented before, but this crossword was special enough to me. ASL is very close to my heart (I use it w/ multiple family members), and this was a great representation and mini-lesson of it. This was also day 100 on my streak, and I got my best Wednesday time! This along with lively fill like EASTBERLIN and ONTOAST with nary a rough patch made this my favorite puzzle yet! 

Bravo, Alex!",94,positive,0.973238468170166
"Okay, but nearly humorless.  The Wordplay author's ""mom"" joke was the low highlight in that department, by default.  (The diagrams were pleasingly goofy too.)

I appreciate the theme, which became evident and easy pretty quickly (even knowing zero ASL).",2,positive,0.7418839335441589
