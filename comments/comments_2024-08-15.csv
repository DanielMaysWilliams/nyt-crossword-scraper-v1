"As usual on a Thursday, I haven't had time to read many comments and I got to the puzzle late because of work. I'm not sure what everyone's mileage was on this one but I thought the eggcorns were fun. 

Took a bit longer than it probably would have for me to figure it out if I were home, but it did give a big aha and a chuckle out loud when I got it! I had one and a half of the theme answers figured out before I knew what was happening ‚Äîthe revealer did help me get the others. I really struggled with Grade A quality though because I thought it was going to be something about equality. Even after I filled out CLOUDY SKIES, I was puzzled. By then, I was alone in the office and started saying it out loud and aha! I got it! Nice!

Please, someone make me remember AGORA. I always know that I know it and have encountered it... but I can't ever just pull that one back out. I'm pretty sure it was just in a puzzle a few days ago! C'mon HeathieJ's brain, in the words of many commenters in past puzzles: Do better! Ha! 

Anyhow, there were a few words/names in there that I didn't know before but I trust that they do actually exist and are fair as I was able to work out everything on the crosses. For a moment, I thought I'd need a lookup on one crossing‚Äîbut I got there!  Huzzah!!

"The abundance of short, choppy fill (VET, HET, ERG, PCB, BOS, STP, etc.) really soured me on this one. The theme was kinda fun but got completely overshadowed by a lot of dud answers (OVIDUCT? LOUSE UP? CATDOM?)

I eventually deduced that it had something to do with a garbled message but thought the answer was the garble not the clue.

"EIFFEL TOWER came in and I repeated my mantra [TM] to myself:  ""When there's a mismatch between the clue and the answer, the trick is in the CLUE.""

But I didn't need my mantra -- and neither do you --  because the revealer clue tells us that.

What great fun this was!  It's always good for a constructor to put his trickiest themer first -- before anyone has figured out the trick.  I had a really big ""Aha Moment"" when I belatedly realized that ""parasite"" =  Paris site.  Now that is really inspired!  Off I went to figure out all the others on my own.  ""Grade A"" = gray day.  Wonderful!!  ""Self-own"" = cell phone.   A bit more forced, but still fun to figure out.  

Other than starting to write in BUTT CALL before BUTT DIAL, I had no trouble.  I didn't know what the computer program was that produces such gibberish, and what I had was SPEECHsomething-or-other.  AGRa instead of AGRO wasn't helping me.  But now that I know it's SPEECH TO TEXT, remind me not to ever sign up for it.

As you know, I have a love of puzzles that put their trickery in the clues.  This was a highly entertaining example of it -- and with the perfect revealer to explain the trickery.  Another candidate for my running list for Puzzle of the Year.",21,positive,0.814709484577179

"I can't say this type of theme is my preferred breakfast meal... But enough of the rest of the grid went great with coffee to start my day right! 

It's too bad voice-TO-TEXT was passed over in favor of SPEECH, because the former is more ""in the language"" for me. Or even talk-to-text. As for the technology itself, I only use it while driving (thanks, Android Auto) and am far from adept at it. (Hi, @HeathieJ!)

I confess, I loved the Boston callouts: of course BOS is the answer opposite NYY. The crosstown team's got nuthin on that rivalry. And even though poor Bobby is now relegated to crosswordese, cluing to his achievements still brings a thrill. 

Yesterday, I didn't get a chance to name-drop my cat, Chloe, who was named for the great Ms. Morrison. And no, she is not a Persian, nor is her housemate. But they do rule the CATDOM -- I mean apartment! 

And now, happily, I have this song in my head, thanks to 39D!
