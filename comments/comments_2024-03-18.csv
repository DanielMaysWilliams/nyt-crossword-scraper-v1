A booster start, or a boost, is to connect cables from an external power source to temporarily supplant the vehicle's dead battery. But there's not ""jumping"" into the car, so not technically a jump-start.",5,neutral,0.7891263365745544

It needs the 'out', and the verb phrase is transitive. No dictionary I've looked in reports use of 'EKE by', and some even insist that EKE can only be used followed by 'out'. 

I also don't get why they seem to think ASAP and STAT are synonymous. ASAP doesn't mean drop everything and do it right now. It's much more forgiving, as implied by what it actually stands for.",10,negative,0.6670058965682983
