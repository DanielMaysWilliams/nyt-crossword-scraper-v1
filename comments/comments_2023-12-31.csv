"Are the nominations for Puzzle of the Year closed?  Thanks to this ridiculous scrolling system invented by the Marquis de Sade, I can't find any of the earlier posts on the subject and have absolutely no idea if nominations were invited FROM the commentariat or if nominations were provided TO the commentariat and only votes on those nominations were invited.

Whatever -- I'm sure I'm a day late and a dollar short.  But I have two puzzles I would nominate for POY.  (There was a third I really loved, by two women, but I can't remember the theme or the names of either woman, so I can't track it down.)

The two I loved and DO remember:

Had to keep reminding myself of how the ball was dropping and which clue worked with which part of that across/down/across pattern.

"Finished, but no happy music.  I searched and searched for mistakes but found none.  Finally, I eyed my entries SEAOAt/tATSU and just tried a K instead. Viola!  My choice of ""T"" I based on the Austin restaurant named Tatsu-Ya.

"Super fun puzzle. I kept plugging away and finally got there with only a couple of look ups I.E. rock weed & crispy cullet. There are a few people that I was unaware of (ENRICO & CAPUTO) but it didn’t stop me from thoroughly enjoying this team effort.

"A great puzzle and a great way to end the year! Thank you. 

Believe it or not, I almost got pseudo-Naticked at the SEA OAK/KATSU nexus. I had all but the K and said to myself, ""Self. do the constructors think that SEA OAts are a kind of rockweed? ""

So I put in the ""t"" and I was pretty sure I'd seen tATSU on a Japanese menu somewhere. (I probably have, since I think it means ""meat."") 

No happy music. 

Took a while to remember SEA OAK, which is not what marine biologists usually call a rockweed, but I'll give it a pass, since it's a bit of a nebulous term. (Here in New England, ""rockweed"" is generally restricted to Ascophyllum nodosum. SEA OAK is Halidrys siliquosa, and is found in colder European waters. I believe there is also a Japanese kelp called SEA OAK but I forget its common name, other than SEA OAK.) 

Come to think of it, a Japanese SEA OAK crossing KATSU is pretty cool. I wonder if that is what the constructors were getting at. Still don't think it's a rockweed, but I'm not going to gripe about it in this otherwise awesome puzzle.",11,positive,0.6156566143035889

"Fun story: the commonly accepted (albeit apocryphal) origin of the SHAKA comes from a sugar mill worker named Hamana Kalili. He lost the central three fingers on his right hand in an accident, and his “all clear” waggle of his remaining pinky and thumb was mocked and mimicked by the local children.

Kalili remained cheerful and kept a positive attitude and spirit of aloha even in the face of this mockery.  Eventually, his cheer was so infectious that others began to use his pinky-and-thumb wave as a gesture of goodwill.

Today, the SHAKA remains a testament to how kindness can overcome malice. A lovely reminder to carry us into the New Year with a spirit of compassion and goodwill.

"The name of the game is SPOT THE BALL.  Once you've spotted it, the parsing of the trick clues becomes much easier.  Not easy, mind you, but easier.  Except for (in my case)...

HERBIVORE.  Because what I don't know about the [animal] sloth would fill a library.  I only know about sloth as a SIN -- a sin I am definitely prone to.  So that once I parsed all the other themers and I saw SIN (28A) right under HERBIVORE, I was trying to parse that in the same way.  I'm looking for a combo of letters dropping down that will form DEADLY SIN or MORTAL SIN.  But it's not there.

Right before coming here I realized that a sloth is an HERBIVORE. The answer needn't be ""parsed"" at all.  Yay!  And Whew!

This is a very intricately constructed puzzle whose intricacies I applaud.  Some livelier clues everywhere else would have made this more fun to solve.  It's Sunday and there's a very big grid, so you've gotta keep those HAHAS coming. But it's a very sophisticated job of construction that I imagine was hard to pull off.",10,positive,0.504467785358429
"This is a second attempt to comment about why the theme was so hard for some of you.  (It's the second time in recent days that I've tried to cut and paste fairly long chunks from other sites, and it seems to me we have a new emu problem on our hands.)

The material I tried to cut and paste is from Rex Parker.  We know how Rex hates almost everything, but when he has an insight, it's usually spot on.  Instead of copying his words, I'll just paraphrase.

The problem is that the ""after midnight"" clues should have been given with the ""before midnight"" clues.  In other words, 23A should have been ""Before midnight: Sloth, e.g./After midnight:  Ointments infused with cottonwood or calendula, e.g.""--instead of having the ""After midnight"" parts clued near the END of the phrase in question.  That is, they clued HERBAL LOTIONS at LOTIONS, which kinda answers the clue, but wobbles a little (it ignores the HERBAL ingredients mentioned in the clue).  Then in the subsequent sets, LADS and LET are real words but don't relate to the clues, and then LGAME and LISTIC are nonsense.  

To make things worse, BALLADS, BALLET and BALLISTIC (i.e. 2/3 of each ""After midnight"" answer) also kinda make sense.

"For the benefit of Bonnie and Rich and all the others who struggled to figure out this theme:

As I said, last night I was shoehorning my solve into a restaurant meal (which preceded a very good Broadway show), so I knew the theme was overly confusing, but I didn't know exactly why.

Rex Parker, who we all know finds fault when there isn't any to be found, came up with exactly what the problem was:  the cluing for all the ""after midnight"" answers was in the wrong place:

...this one had some issues that kept it from landing perfectly. The main one was the theme cluing—seems like both ""Before midnight"" and ""After midnight"" clues should've originated from the same number, since both answers originate from the same place. Very weird / awkward to have the ""After midnight"" clue attached to the Across entry that is just the tail end of the ""After midnight"" answer, since the actual answer begins much earlier, before the BALL drops. So, yeah, weird to have the ""After midnight"" clues linked to ""entries"" like LISTIC and LGAME.
____

In other words, the clue for 23A should have been ""Before midnight: Sloth, e.g./After midnight: Ointments infused with cottonwood or calendula, e.g. : HERBALLOTIONS"".  Then 36A might have been unclued (or clued with ""---"").

"Mighty clever hors d’oeuvre to the Times Square main event tonight.  A lesser puzzle would have simply had a BALL DROP theme, with “ball” going north to south, maybe hidden in other words or phrases, maybe highlighted with circled letters.

But no, we have NEW YEARS EVE, TIMES SQUARE, and BALL DROP as answers setting the scene, then the riddles to crack – the gymnastic word manipulation aspect, made more riddly by the before- and after-midnight angle.

Beauteous, a mic-drop to a stellar year of puzzles.

Rather than talk about the puzzle though, I’m just going to give a big shout out to Puzzlemucker for all the creativity and hard work that went into today’s epic post.  And while I’m at it, let me echo Puzzlemucker’s sentiments.  I’ve been doing crosswords for a long time and had much joy (and occasional frustration) in the process, but my enjoyment has increased tenfold since stumbling upon this merry band of puzzlers.  Happiest of New Years to all! 🥳🎆🎇",23,positive,0.9840307235717773
"The first time I had katsudon, I was slightly taken aback by the flavor of Worcestershire sauce in my Japanese food, but I devoured it and mourned the fact that I didn't live in a culture where I could get this dish as easily as a cheeseburger.  Sadly, the best katsudon I've had was at EPCOT.  Ah me.

Nice ball drop puzzle today. I kinda wanted a single rebus of ""times"" (a times square), but I'll wait.",11,positive,0.6007003784179688
"Ok, so I got the ball drop theme, thought it was pretty clever, and was about 1/2 hr in and had 90% of the puzzle done when I got to 109A ""after midnight: totally lose it"". 

LISTIC.... hmm, add ball- BALLISTIC.... doesn't really fit the clue. OMG, it's GO BALLISTIC! 

I spent the next 5 minutes going back over the theme answers and really appreciating the cleverness of the construction before finishing the puzzle. Amazing!

Nice Easter Egg in the mini today as well  :)",16,positive,0.8810964226722717

"Congratulations on your NYT puzzle debut, Mr. Linzer! Well done!

The “Before midnight . . .”/“After midnight . . .” clues confused me at 23A HERBIVORE and 28A SIN, but I filled in the answers as the crosses dictated. By the time I got to 25A POWERBROKER* and 40A POWER BALLADS, I figured out the trick. 

Mr. Musa, as always, your work was very entertaining. 

Thanks, gents!

"Sadly, I've never been in NYC to see the ball drop in person: on TV it always seems very anticlimactic, there's a countdown, there's a blurry shot of a ball dropping, we turn to each other, kiss and say our annual banalities. But then again, every time I enter a letter in a crossword puzzle here, I'm literally in (a New York) Times Square. In fact I've been in lots of Times squares and when there's a particularly long rebus, it can get pretty crowded and jammed up in there! 

I dug how Cinderella, who had her own concerns about midnight, made her way in this puzzle, and I'm wondering whether she put her glass slipper on the shoe tree. Would love to see a remake of it, Lindsay Lohan in the lead role, all smudged & sweeping ash, while her greedy stepsisters dreamed of powerbrokers and went to spas to get footbaths and the balls of their feet massaged with ghee and mayo lotions, then off to the trendy NY health bar ""Herbivores on Broadway"" to drink spiced tea in the Arab fashion and say droll things like, ""I can't decide, should I wear that zebra wrap Senor Katsu designed especially for moi, or that opera serape with the sugar cane pipets that all the lads went crazy for & was typed up in For Real Magazine & that caused Iggy Pop to say 'I'm in love'?""

Other little things: DEL...RAY was kinda cute for us Lana Del Rey fans...Enrico crossing Caputo, so awfully close to ""Caruso"" ... funny how SOAREWE from afar looks like SO ARE EWE. 

This is a fun little Square in the Times. HNY!",51,neutral,0.47586962580680847

"Not too clear on how the term ""Before midnight"" aided the clues it preceded. Yes, their answers contained the beginnings of the ""After midnight"" phrases, but how exactly did that pertain to those across answers themselves? Superfluous frippery attempting to pass as cunning. Would sincerely appreciate an explanation of the rationale.
And Happy New Year to all solvers and constructors!",8,neutral,0.6397551894187927

"A note on KATSU (since I'm seeing some comments from others about it).

Having spent my early childhood in Japan, I grew up eating fried pork cutlet, which is known as ""tonkatsu."" The word breaks down into two parts: ""ton"" = pork and ""katsu,"" which is a shortened form of ""katsuretsu.""

""Katsuretsu"" is just a transliteration of the English word ""cutlet,"" which in turn referenced a European dish that was introduced to Japan during the imperial Meiji period, côtelette de veau, i.e., veal cutlet or wiener schnitzel. The Japanese modified this Western dish by substituting pork for veal or beef and coating it with panko.

Nowadays, we also see a chicken option in Japanese cuisine, which is usually called ""chicken katsu."" KATSU is just the generic term for a crispy cutlet, and that's how it is clued.",57,neutral,0.9257999658584595

"A Wordplay Holiday Poem, in 6 parts (revised version)

There are complaints about rebi,
rap stars and memes,
about big Sunday themelesses
and try-too-hard themes.
Complaints about complaints?
Yup, we’ve got those too,
sometimes it seems as if grousing
is what we most like to do.
But hold on one minute
that’s not exactly true,
it’s often a party at Wordplay,
let me introduce the crew.

There’s Deb at the helm with humor to spare,
Caitlin by her side, an outstanding pair.
Sam C’s in the house laying down puns,
all three hosts set the table for fun.
Speaking of puns, Mike gives two a day,
that Munster man ain’t cheesy, his puns slay.
CLM’s alternate themers sing, as does her wit,
While John Ezra elucidates through jazz-inflected riffs,
Sam Lyons is both erudite and goofy, 
in the best way, like a scholarly I Love Lucy.
Then there’s the old pro who goes by Newbie,
A wise soul with street cred, and maybe a doobie,
Bill from Yokohama’s got one (or two) lit,
While sotto voce needs only the spirit to uplift,
Coloradoz (by way of Iowa) is steady and strong,
While dutchiris delights in puns, Warriors and song,
Eric Hougland has the constructor’s touch
and spreads positivity and light,
Nancy from NYC has the constructor’s touch
but with Upper East Side bite.",51,neutral,0.6753308773040771
