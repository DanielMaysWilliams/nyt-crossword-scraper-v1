"I‚Äôm somewhat new to crosswords and really enjoying them, as well as reading the comments section after completion!  This was a tricky one in some spots but a fun solve. But can someone explain today‚Äôs 48D for ‚Äúmaking rent‚Äù. I cannot figure out what RIP means in that situation. Thanks!",18,positive,0.94010990858078
"This puzzle was a hard one for me, yet very uplifting with the presence of BOSSA NOVA which runs through my veins, and Brazil beating Paraguay in today's Copa America game, 4√ó1, just as I was solving.

One other thrill for me was seeing ALAN Parsons in the grid, one of my all-time favorites (amazing talent and very spiritual man,) and whose CD I happen to have in the player in my car as I write (great for highway driving when there's no traffic.)
This is one of the ballads, with beautiful lyrics:

I've noticed that I always hit a good stride with Rafa's puzzles, but not when it's a collaboration. Very strange.

And so I wasn't entirely in the same wavelength, but the clueing is, no doubt about it, outstanding.

Thank you, gentleman for a very fine puzzle!",22,positive,0.9626378417015076

Really enjoying this puzzle. Paused to come here and say that I don‚Äôt know it says about me that I input 5-down and immediately saw a name. Nice clueing there to pass the ‚Äúbreakfast test.‚Äù I for sure would have used ‚ÄúPsycho influencer.‚Äù üòÖ,5,positive,0.9056389927864075
"Just the type of late week themeless puzzle I like.  I only had 3 across answers the first time through, but slowly and surely I got it all with no look ups. 
I didn‚Äôt know that was what BOSSA NOVA meant, so I guessed it would start with an n.  Once I was down to nOSSANOVA it clicked.  Plus ‚ÄònOT‚Äô didn‚Äôt make sense.",10,positive,0.745954692363739
"A bit challenging and some good wordplay but JUST FYI I didn't love RIB TIPS.
