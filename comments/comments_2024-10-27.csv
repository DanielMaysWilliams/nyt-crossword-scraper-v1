"I think this is one of my favorite themed puzzles of all time. I loved it, it‚Äôs cute, there were so many supplementary fills to stay on theme, I really enjoyed it. 

My only nitpick is the NYT Editor‚Äôs continued insistence that macaron/macaroon are interchangeable. They simply are not! They‚Äôve been spelled differently for 400 years now. They share the same etymology - but so does ‚Äúmacaroni‚Äù and I don‚Äôt see the Editor ordering cookies with that word! You will not find a ‚Äúmacaroon‚Äù anywhere in Paris except a Jewish bakery in the Marais (unless you order a ‚Äúcongalais‚Äù). You will not find a ‚Äúmacaron‚Äù in the Lower East Side unless you go to a French patisserie. It‚Äôs historically, culinarily, and practically incorrect to treat them as interchangeable. The error isn‚Äôt happening at the crossword‚Äôs level, to be fair to the constructor, it‚Äôs included in the NYT style guide - and it drives me crazy!

My only gripe is that I was (and surely others were?) naticked by the cross between the European volcano name and the hair-lightening brand name, both fairly obscure names.

"As a big fan of the moon and tricky Sundays, this hit the spot. Thanks Jeffrey and Jeff! 

Macaroon rant - back when the ""macaron"" craze was revving up (late 2000s?) a coworker was gushing about them and I thought I'd introduce a bit of trivia that I found interesting - that we in the US call them macaroons and they have been made here for centuries in almond form and later with coconut. She got very upset, surprisingly, and insisted that lowly coconut macaroons were a totally different cookie - not a macaron - and that perfect macarons were very hard to make.  Even after explaining that the only difference was that one had flaked coconut and the other had almond flour, she just got more angry.

Prior to going back to college in the 90s, I was a professional baker for many years, and one of the many products I'd turn out were almond macaroons, baked just like you see in the pictures (though we didn't fill ours). Granted, coconut macaroons are easier to make, as you have to pay more attention to your meringue quality with the almond version, but it's not rocket science - I mean, I made them as a new baker in my teens. Fetishizing food, especially when there's an added snob factor, bugs me, I guess.",10,positive,0.9123506546020508

Kudos to Jeffrey on an inspired idea, and to both Jeff and Jeffrey on a brilliant execution.  While I am not a big fan of Xword puzzles with a rebus feature, I can only applaud when one of them brings a smile to my face.

I will say that I found it interesting that, at least up to this point, there has been no commentary or controversy on the answer to 67A.  I expected there to be all sorts of remarks pertaining to racism, stereotyping of First Nations persons, cultural appropriation and the like.  But maybe that‚Äôs simply because it is simply old news that exhausted everyone when Johnny Depp portrayed Tonto in the 2013 re-make of The Lone Ranger for the big screen. What surprised me even more, however, was reading about a court case in Nova Scotia some 20 years ago in which someone sued her employer for addressing her by that term in 67 A.

"Elegant circle-in-the-square execution for presenting the phases of the moon.

That‚Äôs art.

Translating the concept into a crossword grid ‚Äì making it a puzzle, where the solver has to figure out what‚Äôs going on in the circles, figure out why some have rebuses and others don‚Äôt; using the entire grid so there aren‚Äôt large areas unrelated to the theme; filling the grid despite the restrictions caused by circles which have to contain certain letters, scrubbing junk out of the answer set.

That‚Äôs science.

This puzzle, to me, has the feel of an instant classic ‚Äì how can the presentation of a timeless concept, the phases of the moon, be done any better than this?

I‚Äôm pretty sure it was a New York Times puzzle, although it‚Äôs possible I did it in the back of a Washington Post Magazine.

Our brunch-time solving group thoroughly enjoyed being lured into this puzzle by the NE corner; quickly guessing what a black circle might mean;  but confused/amused by an N and an M in circled squares; there is definitely a learning curve to this puzzle!
Soon enough the light went on, as we entered the MOON light while SMOOCHING with the Lone Ranger!
We all had to stop and enjoy the beauty of this grid, aware of how effortlessly we had all accepted the exquisite deployment of MOON lit rebuses (no small feat to get our group to agree there was no other way this could be executed).
