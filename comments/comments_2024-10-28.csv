Y'all have fun! Cheers from Texas.",2,positive,0.9827405214309692

"So much puckish humor in the cluing of the theme answers.  I loved this!

I wondered if I could figure out the revealer ahead of time?  MOTHER GOOSES YOU was the closest I could come.  That's definitely not it.

I also wondered if the theme answers occurred to Michael first or if the revealer did.  It can work both ways as I well know, but sometimes you have wonderful theme answer ideas and no revealer that works.  That might be the time to have all theme answers and no revealer.  Which would this be?

FALL CLASSIC blew me away.  It's perfect -- and I bet that absolutely no one saw it coming.  The double meaning of FALL is the icing on the cake.

We have our own Polish nursery rhymes, obviously: ""Lokomotywa"" by Julian Tuwim is the best known one, but I began to learn English when I was starting school, so not at an age for nursery rhymes any more. HUMPTY DUMPTY I learned from TV, and not children's TV, either: lines from it feature often enough in film and series dialogue.

"Fast and fun!! It was a new personal best for me in a time I never thought I could achieve. 

It probably helped that I did it on my computer instead of my phone app, which is what I usually do early week puzzles on but even so, this one seemed to fly. But not in a boring way. It seemed bright and cheery and breezy! I really enjoyed it and never thought before about those nursery rhymes all having falls in common. 

My favorite though is the clue for Sunrises. ""They brighten everybody's day!"" So sweet! 

Though I pretty quickly plugged in the theme answers, the revealer was not immediately apparent. I didn't know they called the world series that but it was quickly revealed by the crossings.

In other news, I'm still scratching my head over what on earth I could have possibly written that the emus objected to yesterday when I tried to post something three different times with minor adjustments in each to try to get them through.  It's just funny because I've learned so many facts about emus through the puzzles, but still they are such a mystery. Oh well! There are far greater mysteries to ponder, one supposes.
