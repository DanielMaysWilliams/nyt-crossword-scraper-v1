"The crossing of AFI_IONADO and SA_HA got me, initially - I corrected the crossing in the end, but I was annoyed to do so. Why annoyed?

AFISIONADO looked OK, and those of us us Slavs who spell the diminutive/nickname with an""a"" at the end style it Sasza/–°–∞—à–∞ (that strange letter in Russian is a ""sz"" sound to us) - the clue clearly indicated the spelling used in Slavic cultures was meant, so SACHA is wrong: that is the French/English spelling of the Slavic name.

In fact, I am not overly sensitive, but I see some racist undertones in the clue. All us Slavs were lumped together, even though we are diverse people with strong national identities, varied histories and different languages. Historically, those who treated us as a homogenous group did it not out of the goodness of their hearts but to murder us and turn us into slaves.

Some of us know your ""Sacha"" as Sasza, sure, but to some us it is Sasho (Bulgarian) and Sasze (Macedonian).

"Got my lowest Saturday time ever with this one, aided partly by the Messi-related easy SW fill ‚Äî loved the cluing so thanks to David Karp!",8,positive,0.9612348675727844
A very dense crossword.  Nothing was easy: for example I had AXEL as the skating jump - it's the hardest one - but of course QUAD works.  And for the Beethoven key - I had no idea but you know the second letter will be M - and I quickly surmised that there was no way 54A would have J as its penultimate letter so it had to be a MINor key.  And 10x 10-letter answers!,18,neutral,0.5494137406349182
"I thought this was easier than yesterday and the grid wasn‚Äôt as interesting, but I really enjoyed the clever cluing.",5,positive,0.85093754529953
"Thank you Caitlin, David, and the family of commenters for their gentle humor.  This was an enjoyable evening!",9,positive,0.9845037460327148
Really liked the cluing for MELEE and PEACHEMOJI,18,positive,0.9586280584335327
"Was it a deliberate choice to run MARTIAL LAW on 21 Sept, the anniversary of the declaration of Martial Law in 1972 by then-President Ferdinand Marcos in the former American colony of the Philippines? If so, great job NYT!",10,neutral,0.5265740752220154
Am I the only one for whom PERU was a gimme solely because of Mike Pesca‚Äôs podcast The Gist?,4,neutral,0.7859243154525757
"Such a TANGY, sharp, piquant, and flavorsome Saturday!

So many great clues...
slowly unraveling them was like savoring a rich POT DE CR√àME.

If it seems like I'm hungry, it's only for more delicious puzzles from you, Mr. Karp.

Thank you so much!",15,positive,0.9750490188598633
"I thought I was friends with the programmers, but they gave me the code shoulder.

(That bytes.)",50,neutral,0.7506323456764221
"I dropped in the last letter, ready to start my mandatory fly specking routine, and was congratulated instead.  A welcome anticlimax, and okay by me. 

Thank you, David Karp, for a clever, engaging puzzle that was fun to work, with no crazy stretches of credibility in the clues.  (We'd had enough for one week.)  Come back soon.",26,positive,0.9295651912689209
"I loved the main puzzle today - my second-favorite this week after Thursday‚Äôs brain twister - but I have a bone to pick with the clueing/editing of 1D in the mini. Makers Mark is first and foremost BOURBON, not WHISKEY. (Although bourbon is a type of whiskey made from corn.) In addition, Makers Mark describes itself as ‚Äúbourbon whisky‚Äù (no E). A different brand like Seagrams or Jameson would have been a much better choice.

(Can you tell I solve minis Downs-first, and that misdirect totally broke my solve?)",9,positive,0.9354260563850403
"About that ‚Äúhealth class topic‚Äù:

A local cafe used to have a hand painted menu board listing the fillings for the different sandwiches. Some had abbreviations, like guac, mayo, cuke, etc.
And then there was ‚ÄúSTD‚Äù.

Sun-dried tomato.

I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd had every kind of question about STD on a sandwich, so I would just smile and order the #7.",16,neutral,0.8048898577690125
Going to the Inter Miami VS. NYCFC tomorrow to see Messi!,11,positive,0.5673778057098389
"This was a fun Saturday. I managed to get through it in great time for me but still found it a fun challenge. Thanks constructor! 

After every Saturday puzzle I feel relief that I've kept my streak (of over 1,100) alive through the hardest part of the week. Phew!!!",12,positive,0.9805359840393066
"I couldn‚Äôt stop staring at 18 across and DNF‚Äôd, although I‚Äôm sure some preferred 54 across.",7,neutral,0.49152013659477234
"(Second attempt; perhaps the emus don't like me talking about their fellow avians.)

Interestingly, in French, the word for turkey, dinde, literally means from India (d'Inde).  So the poor turkey is known by all sorts of incorrect national names, and the nation of Turkey had to recently change the spelling of its name internationally to the local form (T√ºrkiye) to avoid being associated with the bird or the slang use of the bird's name as a loser or dud.

Similarly, guinea pigs are not from Guinea. And they're not pigs, either.",17,negative,0.5722424983978271
"Towards the end, I was trying to make answers including the letters K or V‚Ä¶ as I noticed those were the only letters not appearing after the stacks, and figured they would show up to complete the all-26. But alas, they did not dangit!",5,neutral,0.5260711312294006
"This was a nice puzzle with some fun clues.  I tried Sasha before SACHA and found the NW a little sticky until I remembered MOZAMBIQUE, but overall it went down as smoothly as a cold beer after  a few hours of working in my garden. As a retired lawyer I got a chuckle out of appealing outcome for RETRIAL, and also enjoyed poor resolution as the clue for ANTICLIMAX. Not as tough for me as some Saturdays, but a very appealing puzzle.",37,positive,0.9358767867088318
"I had the heart to sail through this puzzle with zeal, and without going in endless loops; it wasn't anticlimactic!

Steve at 10:29 PM on Friday night.",6,positive,0.8365402221679688
"Thanks David for a nice, smooth puzzle. After the anguish of the last 2 days crosswords this was a relaxing stroll. The only stumble I had was TELEPHONE, which I've never heard of. My wife says we should get out more...",8,positive,0.9148026704788208
AREYOUNUTS? ICANRELATE is more empathy than I've come to expect from the NW quadrant!,15,neutral,0.4026111960411072
