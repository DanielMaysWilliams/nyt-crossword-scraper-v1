"This one was part jigsaw, part crossword—tightly made and fun to work. Clean, graceful, and stylish. One of those puzzles that are deceptively simple—once the light goes on and the fill goes in. What looks totally opaque is sometimes right, sometimes wrong, but  gets sorted out by the crosses, not by some creaking wrench with a mystery word. 

Kudos to Billy Bratton for this polished construction.  We await your next one—soon, please.",20,positive,0.8591911792755127

"As the precocious child I was, among other things, I would throw away the loose and orphaned items in drawers around the house and garage. It annoyed my father, especially, when he was looking for the odd battery.

""Stop throwing them away!"" he'd say.

""Why?"" - me, snickering.

He yelled, ""Because that's WASTEDPOTENTIAL!""

"Huh. Super quick, even with  ATTED, EDGELORD and SIN BIN. Is it just me? 

[Shells out for dinner] --> PASTA is excellent, and I can see it working with clam sauce, mussels, escargot, as well. 

The vibe I'm getting from the word choices in the story that this grid tells (all grids have a tale to tell)  is that the protagonist is a down and out gambler who has never lived up to his potential, a life of jello shots and lousy bets, antes into a game where he's accused of cheating. ""It's a lie!"" he shouts. But he's living in a world of con artists who know just which outkast to call, who says, ""You name it, I'll do it."" I'm not so sure hilarity ensues when some joker in a hot rod is bearing down on you, ready to ram you straight into the big Sin Bin in the sky.  In this life, the answer is yes, you are too late, you always will be too late. I'm serious. Meanwhile you're lying at the bottom of a rain barrel, some bird perched on its rim booing at you, and Lassie goes arf arf arf and the last thing you think before you go deep into an Asahi-soaked nightmare, is wishing for a secret menu on your phone with a button that put dogs on silent mode.

"Yes Deb, my hand is up in the air for the ALOE answer. Although, in fairness, even while I was typing it something in the back of my skull was saying ""Easy boy. That could be BALM...""

"The Thursday puzzle still has a hold on me. I confidently filled in ""save the day"" for 1A rather than ""pave the way."" Way / Day. Sadly, it's no longer w-or-d choice day. Lots to enjoy in this fresh puzzle that made me work to get a toehold. I learned a few new-to-me terms.",20,positive,0.51040118932724
"As much as one can do on a Friday, I flew through this one.  Which is to say that I never filled in an answer that I later had to take out, and never spent more than a few seconds thinking about a clue before either filling in the correct answer or deciding to move on.

Whenever I did choose to move on, the word I skipped didn't slow me down the next time around, after there were a few letters in from crosses.

Oddly enough, by no means was I sure about every answer I filled in, but all of them proved to be the right one in the end.

I was well under my Friday average, and even beat my Thursday time by almost a full minute.

Good thing, too, because I'm feeling a little more tired than usual and might be a little under the weather.",9,neutral,0.6296080350875854

"Had an awful time finding a toe hold in this one - when I am reduced to a 3 letter starting entry I know I'm in for a slog. But it surprisingly toppled in an orderly fashion after that. 
Nice puzzle.",19,negative,0.7612382769584656

"A BOOBIRD is NOT a fan who boos the opposing team.  That would be normal.  A BOOBIRD boos the home team, the team he (or she) is supposed to be rooting for, when that team isn't doing well.

This is especially an element of Philadelphia sports culture,

Of course, the concept isn't completely foreign to New York sports fans, either.",27,neutral,0.627311646938324
