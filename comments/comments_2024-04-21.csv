"Reading the comments, I can now see where there was a divide between those of us who assumed the rotations would be done in our heads to get to the secret word, and those who were led to believe the letters needed to actually be turned around to reveal the secret word.

This is truly unfortunate since the puzzle itself, and the constructor's conceit and execution, are sheer genius.

Mistakes will happen, of course, as they did with the instructions.
Still, I'm very sorry for Dr. Schlossberg that his creation suffered for this, and my heart goes out to those who did the switcheroo manually only to have to undo it.

Perhaps this puzzle is a symbol (metaphor?) of modern crossword puzzle construction and editing (disclaimer - I‚Äôm not a puzzle wonk, just reading the comments a lot recently).

Each dial (combination lock?) is a current platform of publication: hard copy, Windows, Mac OS, Android, iOS, some of those on phone vs tablet‚Ä¶ I dunno, also not a tech wonk.

Each has its own bugs or features, some fit in well with the plan (answers that fit the clues), others may randomly not cooperate, and jam or dam up the works.

"It sounds like there were some issues with coding that made this puzzle fail for many solvers. It's a shame -- and not the first time an error in coding frustrated many solvers. 

It worked fine for me in Safari on a Mac. 

But... I was expecting to have to rotate the locks myself. As I solved, when all four letters were in each lock, I figured out how to rotate and what the resulting words would been and what the top letter would be. (FYI, jAM instead of DAM would not work when rotates, so jAM could not be a correct entry.) But as soon as I was done, the animation did all the work for me. I suppose there is no way to allow the solver to rotate a dial on the grid, but, still... at least let us solve it!

There was a full explanation in the notes which is the first thing you should look at. Read and comprehend. Solve. The theme should help you find the answers. So it was DAM not JAM because LOAJ is not a word. I think NAM was the only weak answer today. In this case it just meant that the rotated letters made a word and not nonsense but the circles did spell out Jackpot in the right combination so that was cool.

I'm glad that I had put in jAM instead of DAM for 104a or the gimmick would have been entirely unnecessary, and only there to show off the constructor's skill rather than to give the solver an extra trick to figure out.

I often have overlays turned off (to make figuring out the gimmick more of a challenge) and don't turn them on or look at the title or look for any notes, unless/until I get stuck.  In this case, I happened to have overlays on from the start accidentally, but after completing the grid (with error) and still not understanding how the locks worked, I clicked on the ""i"" to read the note, after which it became clear and I mentally rotated the letters and figured out that it should be a D at the start of 104a.

How it could have been better:
 - Every lock should have had *at least* one ambiguous clue that *required* mental rotation in order to disambiguate the answer
 - The cluing was on the whole too straight forward.  There should have been more punny clues (ones with ?s)

Many folks (including myself) thought the letters had to be physically rotated for a successful solve, which is not the case. 

However, the letters must be mentally rotated by a certain number of degrees to determine whether a valid word can be formed. That is most critical for the N E D O lock. By rotating each letter 180 degrees MEME becomes MEMO,  OVEN becomes EVEN, LOAN becomes LOAD and DAM becomes NAM.

"15 minutes more or less to solve the puzzle. 15 minutes more to figure out why I wasn‚Äôt getting a gold star. 

I read the note halfway through solving because I hadn‚Äôt figured out what the keyholes were about. I interpreted the note as saying that I had to move the letters around each keyhole myself, so I painstakingly switched them out and got the 28 new words and the magic word JACKPOT. 

What I didn‚Äôt get was the gold star. In my first pass through the grid to reorient the keyholes, I noticed I had misspelled AGASSI. Fixing that didn‚Äôt help, possibly because by that time, my C CLEF had become a V CLEF. 

Finally, on my third time through changing the letters around the keyholes, I hit the correct combination. (Some appear to be the original letters, e.g MEME rather than MEMO; some appear to be the new letters.)

I still don‚Äôt whether if I hadn‚Äôt misspelled AGASSI whether the keyholes would have automatically rotated to the correct position to spell JACKPOT. (If the rotation was supposed to be automatic, what‚Äôs the point of the note telling the solver to ‚Äúrotate each dial‚Äù?)
