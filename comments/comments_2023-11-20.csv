I feel like I learned how to spell CONNECTICUT from Bugs Bunny.

"It's always a pleasure to have a Monday that doesn't insult the solver's intelligence, but then Sam is a real pro.  The biggest disappointment for me was already having TENNIS written in before I got to the delightful clue at 19A.  Would have enjoyed figuring it out with no crosses at all.

I saw the revealer halfway through and then put in the rest of the ICUTs I hadn't yet done.  It made the theme answers much easier, of course. But not until I'd finished did I realize that the tiny circles were getting progressively closer together and that ICUT was truly being CONNECTed.  

One of those rare puzzles where I actually enjoyed the tiny little circles.  And the puzzle was so nice that I didn't even mind the squooshed squares in the oversize grid.  Between the circles and the squooshing, I had limited space to write my own letters.  But sometimes you have to make demanding accommodations for a good puzzle:)",6,positive,0.610734224319458

I CUT things all the time!  Fabric, thread, paper, plastic, meat, vegetables, fruit, flowers, shrubs, DHubby's ear hair...  I'm quite the CUT-up.
There's a whole lotta CUTting goin' on:
Cut the rug
Cut and paste
Cut a figure
Cut (and wrap!)
Cut it out--'it' being any number of things....

I once met someone from 60A...and I'm sorry to say she was more than a little stuck up, and in particular condescendingly critical that I had been born in Darkest Georgia (at the time, governed by the unfortunate Lester Maddox.)  She missed no opportunity to point out that anything or anyone associated with GA was tainted thereby.  It never occurred to her that this attitude met the very definition of 'prejudice.'  
I am glad to have some other associations with the Constitution State, with its Charter Oak and historic role in The Revolutionary War...(remember the ""Turn"" series about the spy?)

"So, I liked the theme echo, seeing ICUT in HAIRCUT.

I liked ACE abutting TENNIS COURT, as well as EAT catty-corner to SPOON, and I’M OUT crossing SLEEP ON IT.

I also liked my weekly Monday trial, trying to guess the revealer before uncovering it and before even reading its clue (Hi, @CLM!), as it’s something I’m weak at.  Today I tried so hard, parsing ICUT as “I SEE YOU TEE” (or TEA), among other things.  I got nowhere, finally read the clue, and all became immediately clear, followed by a “Dang!” Then a pause, and then “Next time!” 

And finally, “Brilliant!”  Here’s a word – CONNECTICUT – so ripe for wordplay with that “connect” start, but has any crossword constructor ever made a theme of it?  I don’t think so.  Bravo, Sam, for plucking this one out of the ether, and figuring out such an ingenious way to make it work, by gradually bringing the four letters ICUT closer together in the theme answers.

Was this a lovely way to start the solving week?  Oh, absofrICkinglUTely!  Thank you, Sam – I love your puzzles!",18,positive,0.8846545219421387
"Quite enjoyable Monday puzzle. If I'd remembered that CONNECTICUT was the Constitution State, this would have been a really quick solve, but I had to work that out with some crosses, and then just a bit of pondering before I got the trick.

In any case, this Monday puzzle was most pleasant (a truly Monday Monday), one of those where you never come to a dead stop, but just write in the letters when you get the clue, jump to the next one if you don't get the clue, and come back later.
 
Sometimes I look at the theme when the puzzle is done, sometimes not, and I must confess, there are those times when I'm darned glad to dig up a theme if I do come to a dead stop and need some help.
