No problem!--- I am speaking EX CATHEDRA, so I'll get 'em all on Judgment Day.

I've watched a million shows and movies and documentaries on cyphers and coded messages in the past few weeks but didn't know SCYTALE was a thing. I got most of the letters for that and ADESTE through the crossings and figured just guessed between an A and I to get their crossing.

Loved it, and that's a big compliment from this curmudgeon who is often turned off by the seemingly non-stop debut puzzles by the younger generation and their peppering of ""modern lingo"" abbreviations and the like. 

SCYTALE was a new one for me, but I was surprised by the number of commenters here who were derailed by ADESTE. To me, that was a gimme. But mileage will always vary.

STE-GO was baffling me from the get-go.  And after I got to the clever revealer, it still baffled me.  There's a STEGOSAURUS?  There's an ALLOSAURUS?

But I have heard of the BRONTOSAURUS and the TYRANNOSAURUS, so there's that.

What on earth is SCYTALE?  Forgot to check if that's even the right answer.

Boy, was I flimflammed by that great self-inflicted ""misdirection!"" This was a terrific puzzle, and I can't wait to see others from this Noobie.

"Oh, dear-heart Kareem Ayas,
You qualified your conclusion here with “probably.”
And you are probably wrong:
   “When I was 10, my mom entered me
     into a local art competition.…I lost — but 
     my mom told me the judges had disqualified 
     my piece because they thought it was so good.
     They assumed I had gotten professional help.
     It took me 20 years to realize how ridiculous
     that was and that she was probably just lying
     to spare my feelings.…”

In elementary school, I was unjustly accused of plagiarism by a teacher, and of having parental help by other students for things I wrote or art or science projects.
I believe your dinosaur art just resembled the current zeitgeist of dinosaur images, and it was presumed you copied or traced it from something.
But if your Mom is still able to recall and answer questions, ask her.

"Were this a Thursday, I'd say nothing. But it's Wednesday. I recently did a Thursday puzzle from March twice as fast as this one, and without lookups. I've had Saturdays that went smoother. Today I had to Google my way out of the unpleasant place this puzzle took me to. 

For me the theme was too obscure - the connection between THESAURUS and (dino)saurus was too abstract, given completely different meanings of both words in the original Greek/Latin. They may sound and look similar, but my well ordered mind just did not make the connection because of the very different meanings.

The puzzle was also packed with trivia, and much of it was way beyond the difficulty level of a Wednesday puzzle. SCYTALE and ADESTE would be harsh on their own, even on a Saturday, but today they crossed for a ridiculous low-blow of a natick. I actually read about scytales a few times, both in history books and fiction, but the name is so alien there was not a chance I would remember it. And there were more trivia answers crossing, too.

"Well, KYYAAAAAHHH! right back atcha, Señor Ayas. I’m assuming the pterodactylian KYYAAAAAHHH is like Hawaiian aloha — it can mean both hello and goodbye? 

Loved, loved, loved the puzzle. History, literature, geology, zoology, ahh… 

A word on SCYTALEs. Rushing a bit through the puzzle—a bit sleepy, too—I somehow glided over the “encipherment” portion of the clue, only registering “ancient method” and “a message wrapped around a cylinder.” 

“Amulets!” I thought. 

I just recently read Chris Gosden’s “The History of Magic,” which devotes several pages to Greek, Roman, and Jewish practices of using textual amulets to guard against harm, curses, etc. The protective spells were inscribed into gold metal plates—lamellae—then rolled into cylinders so that they could be worn on the body. Perhaps they weren’t so different from SCYTALEs? In non-Greek speaking areas, lamellae inscribed with spells in Greek were especially popular as the foreign script served to “encode” the message sent out into the universe. Even then humans were impressed with anything that looked indecipherable. How little we change over millennia. And that, in fact, is Chris Gosden’s message. If you don’t mind a bit of dense academicese, it’s a fantastic read. 

On that note, Yule Tidings to y’all.",17,positive,0.5504394173622131
"This is one of those puzzles that make me grateful I'm doing a crossword -- if I were on Jeopardy, I'd be DOOMed.

And you know what? I love it!

Come together. Unite. No. Marry? Wait. MERGE. Aha! 
Now change that yew to ELM. Bingo.

Help! Bring out the dictionary, THESAURUS, encyclopedia!
Of course not. Dig up ADESTE from the back of your mind and keep those fingers crossed. It worked for LAIKA, surely it will work for this, too.
Keep firing those synapses, take a shot at NITER and, wow, voilà, it's done.

I'm not one much for dinosaurs. But that's the thing, I don't have to be -- the reveal gave me all I needed to catch the drift. 

And so, thank you, Mr. Ayas, for taking it up a notch on a Wednesday, and congrats on a fantastic puzzle. 
It's been fabulous fun!

"This is even more impressive given that it's a debut. I'm impressed. 

And great constructor's notes, too. I'm reminded of a childhood drawing of mine of Devo (with their Whip It! outfits) that my dad entered into a gallery competition.

Knock knock
Who’s there?
Ty 
Ty who?
Ty Ranosauraus!

"I loved this. Today I learned what ceratopsians are. Tomorrow I’ll probably have forgotten it, but today I learned it. 

SCYTALE was a word I had come across before, but I didn’t recognize it until I had filled most of the crosses. 

THESAURUS/THE SAURUS made me laugh. Before I reached that clue, I hadn’t any idea what would happen with the shaded squares. The reveal was fun and clever. 

The NE corner gave me the most trouble, mainly because I put some bad answers which I just couldn’t kick out of my brain. I got OTTO I, though! Long-dead emperors FTW.",20,positive,0.9255064129829407
"When I was very young I thought the Beethoven piece was about a particularly hirsute girl named Lisa. 

I also heard that Beethoven conducted the premier of the 9th symphony completely deaf. That at least is partly true: one violinist recalled that although Michael Umlauf did the actual direction, Beethoven stood beside him, co-conducting in a largely ceremonial role:

""Beethoven himself conducted, that is, he stood in front of a conductor's stand and threw himself back and forth like a madman. At one moment he stretched to his full height, at the next he crouched down to the floor, he flailed about with his hands and feet as though he wanted to play all the instruments and sing all the chorus parts.""  

Beethoven was still busily conducting, several bars after the symphony had ended. Contralto Caroline Unger apparently came over and gently turned him around to show him the ecstatic reaction of the audience, who gave him many standing ovations and tossed hats and handkerchiefs into the air.

Here's my guess as to the pic of Miles in Nice. First, he's wearing ""blue material,"" the clue for smut. And there's AFRICA -- Davis was a leader of Afrofuturism in jazz in the 1970s. He played HORNS.  ""Iris"" is on his album E.S.P.., ""Pan Piper"" is on Sketches of Spain. Does that pan out?

A wonderfully tough solve. I thought I'd never hear the music. (And didn't since the sound was off.) When I turned around, no one clapped or threw a hat, but the dog licked my toe: does that count?",37,neutral,0.8165494203567505

"Kudos Kareem on your debut, your persistence, and your fun puzzle.  I liked the combination of travel, basketball and my favourite Saint.  To those planning a visit to the Trevi, I recommend the short train ride to Assisi as well.  It was surprisingly spiritual for us.

"Congratulations on a fun NYT debut, Mr. Ayas!

I couldn’t help but be reminded of “Bored of the Rings,’ a Harvard Lampoon send-up of a well-known fantasy trilogy.

"Congratulations on your debut, Kareem. 

As someone whose childhood fascination with dinosaurs (I was ALBEIT SCARED OF some of the larger therapods) continued into my college studies, I was pleased to see your theme complemented by the overall grid design.  

The descending staircases of black squares (NE to SW) give the puzzle a stratigraphic look, with the dinosaur bones (e.g., TRY and ANNO) now scattered about, as the sedimentary layers have shifted and buckled with tectonic and volcanic activity (SEISM, BASALT). For the adventurous fossil hunter, there are even ceratopsian HORNS to be found here, appropriately crossing TRI(ceratops).

I'll close with non-theme observation. Another example of the priming effect can be found at 14A and 15A. After ACTS, you might have thought ""bible"" before LEBRON. Nice try.",22,positive,0.9351751208305359

But others said: “Please make sure to ANNOTATE what MARTYRS we were. Or, describe us as victims. Or, tabulate the casualties.”

I went to it to try out my school Russian, admire the stainless steel dentures a number of crew members were proud to show off, and trade American cigarettes for Soviet smokes.
