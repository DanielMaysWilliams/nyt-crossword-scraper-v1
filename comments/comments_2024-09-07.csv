While I do take issue with certain clues or answers, I rarely find an entire puzzle to be worthy of rebuke.  There was ""some obscure"" trivia today (which I'm not thrilled by), but not any more than usual.  And there were some clues that didn't quite work as well as they should (like ""family inheritance?"" for GENEPOOL), but not more than one or two.  That kind of clue is my particular bugaboo.  I love, love, love clever wordplay, but I am disappointed when the ""clever wordplay"" doesn't quite work.

I enjoy a difficult puzzle, but not at the expense the clues/answers working well together.  A few tough puzzles in the past few months had this problem.  They were tough not because of well constructed and clever clues, but because the answers didn't really work well enough with the clue (IMO).

This puzzle was light on wordplay (so not my fave), and the grid geometry made it more like a grouping of mini-puzzles (one in each corner plus the middle), but overall it seemed like a very traditional ""more difficult"" puzzle.  The reason it was tricky was because many of the clues were not obvious and one really needed to work the crosses to figure it out.

"Solved it unaided, but quite the workout for me: ""You solved a Saturday Crossword in 1:20:39.""

The design essentially consists of a main puzzle connecting the NE and SW corners of the grid, with two substantial ""mini crosswords"" very loosely appended in the NW and the SE. Presumably, our constructor is especially fond of the horizontal and vertical stacks that intersect to form a 3 x 3 block of letters in the very center of the puzzle.

In any case, I was doing reasonably well until it came time to solve the mini in the SE corner. The clue for TURMOIL was *completely* useless to me, and I had with CORE rather than BORE, RECESS rather than MOTION, and MEH rather than MID. So, needless to say, it took me a while to sort that corner out. 

INNOUT crossing ATUL was also tricky.

"This is a reply to Steve L. about the puzzle's relation to the poem:

TWOLAABB is indeed one of the most ICONIC poems of the 20th century, much has been written about its meaning, lyricism, philosophical underpinnings, etc. I do give a rat's tail about this poem and admire Mr. Williams for his homages to it. 

But I have also, like you & most everyone else, given up on finding connections between poem, grid, clues, design, etc. In earlier grids in the series, there were birds, trees & elements of the poem that were likely intentional echoes but the connections were tenuous, felt like guesswork.

In Section 5 of TWOLAABB Stevens addresses precisely this issue, the purported meaning of the blackbird's song and the attractiveness of alternative readings and interpretations --  the beauty of ""innuendoes"" -- and the difficulty of choosing, of prioritizing one meaning over another, almost rungs on a ladder (!). So far so good. But the problem of translating that tension between ""inflection"" (intended meaning) and ""innuendo"" (unintended meaning) into a puzzle is probably what's turning people off: solvers tend to be people who derive pleasure out of finding the singular solution to a problem, whereas poetry -- and especially Stevens' -- encourages readers to derive many meanings and readings. Solvers by their nature probably don't care for that much. 

I can see how this puzzle is meaty enough to handle various ""readings"" of it, but like you, Steve, I'm not doing it.",25,neutral,0.5170331597328186

Those pings did come, and they felt very well earned; those boxes filled with fanfare.  And, like my dog ferreting for a treat I‚Äôve hidden, I persisted with no intent of flagging. Pings begat more pings, less spaced apart.

"Yes, Steve, Wallace Stevens is a major poet of the 20th century, and this poem from his first collection is regarded as one of his best.

He led a movement against the dry and academic style of Eliot and Pound as well as those who clung to older forms based on rhyme and meter.  (The ""bawds of euphony"" in a later stanza refers to poets, (bards), selling out by relying on those forms.)

Today's stanza specifically addresses poetics, with ""inflections"" representing the words on the page and ""innuendoes"" being the associations formed in the mind of the reader.  This can be applied to all forms of perception.

Crosswords offer a perfect example.  We have to read the clues at face value, but solving requires perceiving the puns and misdirections associated with them.",31,positive,0.7298466563224792

GENEtics was bound to be wrong, so I tucked it away, moved on, and when the POOL filled up I knew what to do.  It was that kind of puzzle.  Some fills I had to take on faith (BIT TORRENTS?) and some were just there for me (SEA SERPENTS, CONGO, SEANCE, etc.). The music sounded and amazingly, it was done with no errors.

So Saturday is in the bin without too much heartache, although a bit of battered brain syndrome.
