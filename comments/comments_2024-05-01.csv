I rather suspect JAPANS may not be well-known. I'm familiar with it as a trend in 50s-60s jewelry, where the black finish provided a dramatic contrast as a setting for clear and colored rhinestones. Not my favorite jewelry, but it can be striking.",4,positive,0.9378350377082825

I like a puzzle that leaves you smiling and nodding. A nice mid-week mid-difficulty level, no STEM grant needed for this one but that's apt for a Wednesday! Might be an enjoyable solve even for someone who's green at it. Doesn't knock you to the flora with difficulty, likely wouldn't pistil anybody off, offers a potpourri of subjects (but isn't loaded with *too* many pop-py references that might incite impatiens) and is just overall a nice little puzzle that grows on you.

No, we shall dance
Plant gardens
Dress in colors
And teach our children

Attorney is usually abbreviated ATT, but occasionally in crosswords is abbreviated ATY (which I hate, btw.)  It wasn't ATY here, I'm happy to say, but if it had been, then a ""Y"" would have been the first letter of the answer to the ""Rule of"" comedic principle.

I remembered my Nichols and May.  To keep an improv skit going, you're supposed to always say YES, AND...?

But, wait.  YES, AND is one letter too long.  Darn!  I put the ""T"" in ATT.

Somewhere in the back of my mind, I remembered something said by one comic or other that THREEs are funny in a series, twos and fours aren't.  (And there was HEIDI to help out too.)

It‚Äôs a tool and not the culminating goal. Music is the goal. Here‚Äôs the thing. The creation of the solfege system is credited to a monk named Guido. Guido d‚ÄôArezzo, one thousand years ago. He took a hymn, Ut Queant Laxis, and used the text as a mnemonic, using the beginnings of words in the text. The relevant words: Ut, resonare, mira, famuli, labii. Or ut, re, mi, fa, sol (why not so?), la. There was no ‚Äúti.‚Äù Someone else had to come up with that. Someone else also had to come up with syllables to represent the chromatic tones. There are lots of variations depending on whom you ask. The relevant point, all of it is a tool box of mnemonics with the ultimate goal of being able to read music and sing it in tune.

"Shattered my ankle in February and lately,
I try to do *something* different and progressive

This morning, I decided to sit in on our kitchen couch,

looking out at our woods and creek, 
has a the sweetest apple blossom tree.

When it wants to, it blooms.
We can go three years without a bloom.
I last year was a banner year, so our hopes 
were low.

Yesterday, it was like popcorn popping!

I chuckled at SOL (and was so thankful for it!) for reasons all here will know, and learned the term JAPAN varnish which I've only always known as lacquer.

Finally the theme itself put a smile on my face as I love flowers.
Long ago, when I was twenty, I wrote something about a boyfriend with whom the communication was absent, and it ended with the words 
""I know the desert 
Because I've been in the desert
And so I can tell you
It's flowers I like.""
(Side note: I had previously gone camping in the middle of the desert, and never went camping again, lol!)

And so, leaving the desert behind, and back to majestic peonies...
This was a heart-warming puzzle, with perfect clueing and beautiful execution.

"PSST - any upstate NYers WANT SOME good KARMA?

If you're in Putnam County and see a SENIOR loading groceries into a Subaru with DAHLIAS tags, wish her a pleasant day and tell her you're a puzzle fan like her son in JAPAN",46,positive,0.6595429182052612
"Anyone else have a kitchen drawer like this:

Six Phillips screwdrivers but not a single flat one;
Ten year old useless rubber bands;
Little plywood marker showing ‚Äú1‚Äù and ‚Äú2‚Äù for remembering which side of the waffle is cooking;
Laser pointer cat toy;
Loose paper clips and thumbtacks (ow);
Batteries, dead or alive;
Large thing wedged back there that prevents drawer from opening fully;
Possibly a few actual misplaced UTENSILS;

And, oh yes: the shears for cutting a bouquet from the garden. Here, have some daffodils, everybody.",69,neutral,0.48509958386421204
"Lots of fun with this one.  Not my PB for a Wednesday, but still managed a time much faster than my average.  A case of putting the petal to the mettle?

"I found this one to be right in my wheelhouse, and finished in almost the same time as Tuesday‚Äôs.  The revealer made it particularly easy, but I enjoyed the floral theme enough to find the puzzle fun as I have been spending much time during the recent stretch of spectacular spring weather tending my garden (and my daughter‚Äôs as well).  My only hiccup was at 8A because use of the word baby in the clue had me thinking singular and it took me a few beats to realize that since 43A was plural 8A should be too.

I loved one of my favorite operatic sopranos, KIRI Te Kanawa, getting a shoutout. Her rendition of O mio babbino caro, my favorite aria, is sublime.

As an avid birder, I was also pleased to see TEALS.  Blue-winged and green-winged teals, which I can see during migration here in PA are elegant ducks in their breeding plumage, but the cinnamon teals I was privileged to see on my recent visits to San Diego are truly spectacular.

Not puzzle related, but I was thrilled when my four year old grandson was able to beat me at backgammon this weekend without any adult assistance at any point in the game.",31,positive,0.9675958752632141
"Fun puzzle with a cute theme. I'm glad to see ""Sol"" spelled correctly after the brouhaha in the comments from Sunday's puzzle.

Japans seems questionable, although Japanning is apparently a legitimate technique.

Can someone explain how TEALS is dabbling ducks?",9,positive,0.8915216326713562

April showers bring May flowers.
