"I got a new personal record on this puzzle even though I had a very hard time in that southeast corner, I was expecting the theme entry to rhyme like the rest, but it most assuredly did not. 

But while I might have been LATISH getting INTO sync with HOFF, I still got it together fast enough that my record time didn't HINGE on figuring out the non-existent rhyme.",6,negative,0.4834884703159332
"Very fun, very amusing puzzle. I loved 58A. Also, the Donovan ref. Took me back. Thank you.",12,positive,0.9864029884338379
"A Slash of Blue (204) 

A slash of Blue‚Äî 
A sweep of Gray‚Äî 
Some scarlet patches on the way, 
Compose an Evening Sky‚Äî 
A little purple‚Äîslipped between‚Äî 
Some Ruby Trousers hurried on‚Äî 
A Wave of Gold‚Äî 
A Bank of Day‚Äî 
This just makes out the Morning Sky.

Fun puzzle.  Gia should be in the running for an early week POY* for her last Tuesday puzzle which featured, audaciously, SESQUIPEDALIAN, OBSTREPEROUSLY and, doubly audaciously, ANTIDISESTABLISHMENTARIANISM (divided into two entries).  Four NYT puzzles in 2023.  It might not be a GET RICH quick scheme, but it has been a year to RELISH for any constructor.

*If anyone has a better acronym/initialism for our end-of-year reader awards, please let us know.",31,neutral,0.6670111417770386
"I‚Äôve said ‚Äúorange door hinge‚Äù so many times, I feel like Ted Lasso‚Ä¶

I don‚Äôt get it.

No, I mean I don‚Äôt get the ‚Äúthat doesn‚Äôt rhyme‚Äù comments. It‚Äôs an end rhyme.

Àà√¥r(…ô)nj,Àà√§r(…ô)nj/  AND   hinj/

Here, 
whispering in the dark,
it rhymes.

My cat thinks I‚Äôm crazy.

What do the emus think?",18,negative,0.5841771364212036
"I grew up on the east coast so I pronounce orange ""AR-ange."" Definitely doesn't rhyme with ""door hinge.""",12,neutral,0.6624816060066223
"Fun, quick puzzle, lighter than yesterday, but this often means. Hang onto your hat, Wednesday will crush you.

Nice try with 58A, but this orange still doesn't rhyme  with anything‚Äîunless you drop the H and say it with a Cockney accent. 

Thanks for a dandy diversion, Gia Bosko!",8,positive,0.8758386969566345
"You know my Claudius (shown) is white.
According to him, ‚Äúopening in a pet carrier‚Äù is:
‚ÄúA wormhole leading to a frightful 15 minutes in the scary noise machine, followed by disagreeable interaction with that overly chatty person that sticks things in me, followed by a gruesome repetition of the noise machine.‚Äù

We are apt to experience WHITE FLIGHT and WHITE FIGHT whenever this wormhole is brought into the house.",21,neutral,0.5457949638366699
"Simple and straightforward, but that's not a bad thing at all for a Tuesday puzzle! I did find it a bit more towards a Monday level of difficulty, but rather enjoyed it anyway. 

The only thing that slowed me down a bit was the Roman senator clue - as always, I failed to read the entire clue and just automatically put in NERO, my typical 'oh it's 4 letters and Roman? gotta be him' fill, and only realised it didn't work when I tried to get the crosses.",6,positive,0.9134129285812378
"This was an enjoyable puzzle, no junk, and the only place I got stuck was the last letter of 63A and 45D. I didn‚Äôt know either answer.",8,positive,0.8924245834350586
