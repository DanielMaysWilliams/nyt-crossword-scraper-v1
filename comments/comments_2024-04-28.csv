"On another note (haha): Bill in Detroit commented about never having seen a conductor in a TUXEDO; it's usually white tie and tails, or something else altogether. 

Putting aside* whether or not a tailcoat could be considered a form of tuxedo (I have no idea), or whether Pops conductors routinely wear ""plain"" tuxes, this puts me in mind of a welcome movement in classical performance. Orchestras, soloists, conductors, and, yes, choruses are abandoning the traditional dress codes that were very male-dominated and restrictive to gender nonconforming individuals. 

My own chorus has ditched the ""tuxedos for men and very specific dresses for women"" code in favor of ""wear black - no bare arms, shoulders, or legs."" In addition to not forcing nonbinary people into specific categories, it also allows different body types to wear clothing that they look best in.

SOL appears to be somewhat regional (thanks for that learning, Aussies!), and SO has been an accepted form for at least half a century. In any other context, in any other crossword, that would be enough for me to accept it. And this is a crossword, not a concert hall or a music theory classroom.

"Seems most enjoyed this one and I'm glad to hear it! This puzzle was definitely not for me but there were four clues that I did really appreciate: bumpy ride for CAMEL, cost of guacamole for EXTRA, classical singers for SIRENS, and especially the as all get out clue for HOUDINI. I thought those were clever and fun!

Much of the rest was outside my wheelhouse with loads of crosses that I just didn't know and couldn't work out. I enjoy hard puzzles especially if I can crack a fun theme or rebus or whatnot but this one was chock full of stuff I simply didn't know. And that's okay, it's bound to happen sometimes... Just like when the dog bites, when the bees stings, when I'm feeling sad... üòâ

I appreciated the theme and those few clues at least, as I do cream-colored ponies and crisp apple strudels, doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles....  Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings...

The theme actually came easily to me with PAVAROTTI, one of the few proper nouns I knew easily, along with my love for Sound of Music. Figuring that out so early helped me a bit with answers I didn't know, but not enough. 

Boy, did I ever dream of wearing a wedding dress like Maria's, as a kid! My dream wedding! When I actually got married I wanted nothing like that, I wanted sweet and simple -- no train for me to trip over, let alone one a mile long!

"""26A Comparable that's an inadvisable starting  choice in Wordle.""

It's a myth that there are inadvisable starting choices in Wordle.  If you were to use ""RARER"" as a starting word, the worst that could happen is that there aren't any R's or A's in the solution. If there are, you will know where at least some of them land and you're on solid ground for finding the right word.  Either way, it's not such a bad choice to start with.

I pluck a random starting word out of the air every morning, and in the 628 puzzles I have played, stats say I have solved it 98% of the time. 
The WordleBot and I often take the same number of entries to solve, and sometimes I out-Wordle the WordleBot, with fewer tries‚Äînot so rarely as I would have expected (smug smile here).

At the same time, I thought the theme was a bit light ‚Äî especially because the notes didn‚Äôt come in order.

I realize that putting the scale in order would have made this significantly harder to construct, but it also would have made for a much tighter theme and better puzzle.

"Fun puzzle today. A bit on the easy side, but I came in about halfway between my Sunday best and average.

I figured something was up with PAVAROTTI, but I don't know all those tenors, so I held off. Plus, I was kind of hoping that the answer would be theotherguy. https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/aaa67fda-6fbf-4cc3-bbff-9f335635d262

Because the other themers weren't clear to me (ask me for a rapper or a country singer after about 1976 and I'll strike out just about every time) I didn't really see how it worked until GLISSANDO.

How nice it would have been to see 125A come in with either STRAdS or (even better) STRAtS.

Oh, on the whole BRO thing, it's a newish reference to a generally younger male-dominated subculture. Wikipedia says it's poorly defined, but it's a thing. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bro_culture 

It's been identified as a real problem in the workplace, largely because of the abusive and exclusionary characteristics of the culture. https://www.breathehr.com/en-gb/blog/topic/company-culture/bro-culture-and-why-its-an-issue-for-startups

"Yet another example of why constructors should not write and editors should not accept gimmicks: The name of one of the trio of tenors is *not* PAVAROTI, it's Pavarotti. The answer that the author and editors are looking for is simply incorrect, and someone could come away from the crossword -- the intent of which is to test and convey knowledge -- thinking that this is the correct spelling of the man's name.

"Enjoyable Sunday puzzle. I actually caught on to the trick fairly early and that was a big help, but still needed a few googles and ended up being another longer than average workout for me. Just a lot of nice 'aha' moments when something dawned on me from the crosses. 

Answer history search led to a couple of interesting finds. One a Thursday from June 9, 2005 by David J. Kahn. In that one the middle across answer was 15 rebus entries:
DO RE MI FA SOL LA TI DO TI LA SOL FA MI RE DO.

But the other search is way off topic and was inspired by the name of a commenter earlier today. Was bit surprised by this. First....
...GUPTA has actually been an answer in 5 puzzles, with 'Sanjay' in the clue every time. But... SANJAY has never been a part of any answer. In fact, the closest any answer comes to that sequence of letters is - SANJACINTO, which was an answer in two pre-Shortz puzzles. 

Sorry for the drift. I'm done.

"A puzzle that even Guido D'Arezzo would""* have approved of! (Of course, he would have questioned ""what's all this about TI-Do?""--Ananias Davisson** would have added ""and what's a RE?

This has been a rough week for me, what with the NFL draft and all--somehow, I managed to complete yesterday's puzzle, about 9pm, without look-ups, but it was rough going. But Wednesday's ""Lateral symmetry"" puzzle! I got the Gold Star, but only with a crib note from Sam; my over-tired self would never have seen the unusual ABYSM, the masculine MAXIMUS, and the rotationally, not laterally, symmetrical crossing ""S"".

But that puzzle, and this, reminds me of a question once posted by David Connell, whether there has ever been a puzzle with theme entries (exclusively) in the -downs, in which the theme didn't have something to do with downward motion or verticality. Today's obviously does--at least the ends of the theme entries. But Wednesday's puzzle's theme had to do with verticality only in that only vertical entries would have maintained the lateral symmetry of the constituent letters; the only horizontals which could have satisfied the theme would be short palindromes like MUM or MA'AM.

"I liked the theme echoes in the non-theme answers that ended in scale notes: AGLARE, ACTI, ESSO, BLARE, OGRE, CRESCENDO.

And, as if to emphasize that SO is acceptable as the fifth scale name, it‚Äôs even spelled out in 127-across (ESSO).

Very impressive to debut on a Sunday, and the constructor‚Äôs passion for music shines through, IMO, giving the puzzle an aura of delight that added to the solving experience.  That he only started solving crosswords five years ago makes this puzzle even more impressive.

Because there was an effort to clue as many answers musically as possible, may I suggest that 112-down (SLIP) could have been clued [1977 hit ‚Äú___ Sliding Away‚Äù].  And maybe others can find more.

"What an admirable puzzle. My first reaction when simply looking over the clues, before I filled in even a single letter, was that this was going to be impossible, filled with musical arcana that would be way too obscure for me. I even got a little huffy about it, and thought of Kincaid of San Diego's drive-by comment a day or two ago (something about boring and awful and he'd rather thaw his freezer, garnering a hundred likes from the like-minded). But then I got to work, hammering in a piton here and there and commencing the climb. Eventually I summited. I caught on at Wiz Khalifa and once I got the trick, boom!

As someone who tends toward the organic (in the metaphorical sense, I'm not talking about Whole Foods aisles), and who thinks computers & technology have caused us -- humans -- to radically mentally regress as a species, I'm troubled by the increasing reliance on technology to create puzzles, and (irrationally or not) fear that handing over 50% of puzzle creation to a ""fill engine"" will lead to a general atrophying of that part of the creative brain responsible for the fill. On the one hand, Mr. Ellison is a genius for building such an engine. On the other, it's a death knell. The cat's out of the bag with AI: that's what's next, right?
