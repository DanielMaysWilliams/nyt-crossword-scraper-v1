"As has frequently been the case recently for me, my only real stumbling block was in the NW.  I didn‚Äôt know OOO and I was wracking my brain to come up with the friend.  Although I was never a regular watcher of Friends, I had seen enough episodes that I thought I should get this one right off the bat, but after cycling through Ross, Rachel, Phoebe, Joey, and Chandler, all of which obviously didn‚Äôt work (either because of the length or lack of fit with the crosses) I just couldn‚Äôt come up with the elusive missing friend with C as the next to last letter.  Then like a bolt out of the blue, MONICA popped into my head and the final pieces fell into place.

The theme itself was easy enough to spot, and facilitated the solve.  I was hoping for the graphics to supply a little charge at the end and I was not disappointed. A perfectly fine, if not electrifying, puzzle",13,negative,0.5935990214347839
