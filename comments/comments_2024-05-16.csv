Great puzzle. Just wish I was clever enough to solve independently. Have to appreciate an Athens shoutout as well.,0,positive,0.9630595445632935
"congrats on a first puzzle! that‚Äôs awesome.

once i finally read the 63 across clue more closely and saw that it referred to the starred clues rather than the answers, i got the theme and finished up. nicely done.

so my critique is not with the theme. it is with a few of the other clues, where the connection to the answer seems tenuous.
2D - eh‚Ä¶ seems like a stretch 
8D: i would describe nilgiri as being ‚Äúon rice‚Äù more than ‚Äúover rice‚Äù. subtle difference but in context of food,  ‚Äúover rice‚Äù connotes more of a larger bed or scoop of rice, not a tidy square of rice that the fish covers. .
62A:  i don‚Äôt see how ‚Äúpoints‚Äù gets us to codas. yes, i understand that a coda is a final passage in a musical score. but ‚Äúpoints‚Äù seems to have no connection to the answer. it only has a connection to the pun aspect of the clue.

66A: i guess you can argue that ‚Äúdunno‚Äù elides the ‚Äút‚Äù sound. but elide refers more to dropping syllables and vowels, which is not what‚Äôs happening in ‚Äúdunno‚Äù.

i understand that these nuts are pedantic, but this is what i mean by some of the clues being just a shade too removed from the answers - leaning in favor of cleverness at the cost of accuracy",0,positive,0.8474140167236328

"I only started doing the NYT crossword 10 months ago, and used to only attempt Sunday through Wednesdays. About 6 months ago I started trying to do everyday of the week, and initially needed lots of lookups to finish Thurs, Fri, and Sat. Now after all these months of daily challenges and practice, I feel like I'm really hitting my stride. 

All that is to say, I loved this puzzle and found the theme straightforward once I got the revealer. Made solving the starred clues much easier and the rest of the grid came together from there!

"I have still been solving puzzles fairly regularly but life happens, and I don‚Äôt always have time to read Wordplay (or finish my comment, especially when there‚Äôs so much I want to say, usually a lot of gushing!)

But this one I don‚Äôt want to miss commenting, even if the Friday puzzle has been published, and probably barely anyone will get to read it.  It‚Äôs just TOO GOOD!  

And it‚Äôs an NYT Debut!  I am floored.  Congratulations Sara, on your maiden puzzle and your new baby!  I enjoyed this very much.  

Like Deb, I got the Revealer and persisted thru the solve without mid-checks but still didn‚Äôt understand why the themes were such (until I read Wordplay).  This is why reading Wordplay is essential LOL.  

But my mind got the workout it needed, and so much clever clue-ing!  I also liked the clue pairs throughout the grid.  Will try to comment again later with the clues I especially loved.  

Toughest clue for me was TO AT and SHORT I.  I thought Head of lettuce was CFO because of Chief Food Officer lol.  I still managed to write a long comment even if I have so much to do today.  And yes, a lot of gushing.  I told you. So well deserved tho.  Happy Friday!",4,positive,0.7597411274909973

"This was a wonderful tricky Thursday! I figured out quickly that the starred clues were not enough to fill in the themed entries, but the crosses are easy enough that (if you are solving top to bottom) you can fill some of them in before you get to the revealer.

I had some issue with the intersection of ‚ÄúOUTEAT‚Äù and ‚ÄúTO A T,‚Äù but that is on me.

Robert Burns‚Äô kail came back today, maybe red-leaf.

Doest and dost are both forms of the verb ‚Äúto do‚Äù, as used in 1611 when the King James Version of the Bible was published.

As part of FTA (Future Teachers of America) I was part of a tour of Georgia colleges, including UGA in Athens.

Just a few weeks ago there was the puzzle, also a Thursday, I believe, with the revealer A STAR IS BORN. I solved that puzzle, but had to read Wordplay to understand the theme. Thanks to that one, this puzzle was not only a breeze to solve, but to me it's the same kind of theme as the earlier one. So after I got the revealer, completing the rest of the starred clues was a piece of cake (with a scoop of ice cream, of course).

"Well, this is a constructor who loves wordplay, obvious to see in the word-manipulation theme and in the many first-rate punny clues.  

Some of those punny clues have been used before, but, IMO, were well chosen. Some of them were original, such as [Pounds, perhaps] for ACHES, and [Down more than] for OUTEAT.  All of them had me smiling throughout the solve, and that is a gift.

I filled in the entire grid except for the revealer, and wrenched my brain trying to crack what it could be, trying to see how the theme answers could relate to their clues.  All to no avail.  Finally, after uncle-ing, I had to bow down to the beauty of the conceit, to the wit of taking ALL FOR ONE, ONE FOR ALL, and first, seeing this theme, then second, beautifully executing it.

I liked the duplicate [Stag] clues ‚Äì could have had another duplicate by using [Carpenter or mason] for TRADE as well as for BUILDER.

First thing I thought of after solving this was that I want to see more puzzles from you, Sara, with your love of wordplay and your ability to craft a terrific theme.  Congratulations on your NYT debut, and I repeat, more please.  I loved this!",38,positive,0.8887421488761902

"Hmm, apparently unlike others I had no trouble getting the theme (kind of surprised to hear the misses), but I have a bone to pick with Rotary Joint.  It wasn't difficult at all; I first assumed it was a common medical reference I had been oblivious to.  But searching later after finishing, it really does NOT seem all that common, unless you work a lot with steam fittings.  There is also an anatomical variety more commonly called a pivot joint.  It just seems kind of awkward for such a long answer....
