"Disappointed to see Arnold Schwarzenegger in Todays crossword. 

Although it’s been fourteen years since his adulterous affair with his housekeeper and the existence of their son was revealed, nothing can change how badly Schwarzenegger acted. He betrayed his wife and children with his affair. He lied to them for years. There is also the unequal power relationship of employer/employee with his housekeeper to consider. 

No amount of contriteness can make up for this kind of misogyny.",0,negative,0.9000445604324341
*adjusts glasses* um actually the plural of opus is opera,0,neutral,0.8484108448028564
"Concerning OPUSES:
Traditionally, Opus numbers (now, doesn't that sound better?) were assigned by publishers, not the composers. As such, they often inaccurate as concerns completeness or chronology. For instance, Vivaldi wrote hundreds of concerti (along with operas, sacred music, etc.), but only a few dozen were published in twelve opus-numbered collections. As far as chronology, the symphonies of Dvorak and Bruckner are particularly messy. And if a composer dealt with more than one publisher, things could get very confusing.

A better system are the catalogues done by musicologists for most major composers--more complete, more accurate, and besides, you get to name the catalogue after yourself. Thus Hoboken XXI:3 (*The Seasons*, by Haydn); Schickele 1/2tsp. (*The Seasonings*, by Bach)(RIP). But even these catalogues present problems--musicologists are constantly revising the scholarship, new manuscripts are discovered. And the rivalries!: in the case of Dominico Scarlatti, there are *four* competing catalogues!

At least in academic discussion, no musicologist would use the term ""Opuses""--the plural is ""Opera""--abbreviated ""Opp.""--as in ""Opera omnia"", an edition of the complete works of a composer.

Ah, Musicology! No wonder HESSE imagined it as the best preliminary study toward mastering The Glass Bead Game! (But then, he didn't know about Wordplay.)",6,neutral,0.8064307570457458

• Junk-lite answer set, including beauties PHENOMS, STYMIE, and MEMENTO, despite a theme that takes up a sizeable 51 squares.
• Two places where theme answers cross!  I would love to have seen Jake’s face when he realized that this too was possible.

"I still remember being 12 years old, puttering around in my room one evening, and I could hear my parents talking downstairs. Occasionally I heard my name, but couldn't really make anything out. Then there was silence. I kept puttering. If I remember, I had attached with tape some copper wires to the anodes of some bigger batteries and was about to thrust the wires into a little bead of mercury, a little plumper than a lentil,  I had obtained by breaking open a thermometer. I wanted to see what would happen when you electrocute mercury. Then I heard my father shouting up to me. ""John Ezra, you wanna hear about the birds and the bees?"" I thought about it for several seconds. ""Not right now,"" I called down, ""maybe in a bit, I'm a little busy right now."" I could hear my father laughing awkwardly and moving away. He never brought it up again and I never did learn. The mercury bead after repeated zapping developed a grayish mottled skin on its surface, like the surface of the moon, which disappeared when I stirred it with the tip of a loose copper wire.
