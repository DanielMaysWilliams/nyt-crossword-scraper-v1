Too late, I know, but I just gotta vent about yesterday's puzzle.  Only a New Yorker would be aware of the term NUYORICAN.

"It was another tricky one today for a Wednesday, following on from yesterday's very tricky Tuesday, but I found this one immensely more satisfying. Plenty of ""Aha!"" moments, and the theme was very enjoyable to try and work out! It makes me think of people I know where English isn't their first language, and they say English is confusing - I agree, and this proves it entirely!

Unfortunately I couldn't finish this one due to a few clues I was completely stumped on. I wasn't familiar with ""On the LAM"", AFLAC, ASSAY or ATF. LEA and FEN caught me out as well. BOSC was unfamiliar to me, too.

However, I can't really fault this puzzle otherwise; there will always be American-centric clues that I won't get from time to time, as well as things I'm unfamiliar with, no matter how much prep I do. It was a lovely fill for the most part - ISLE, MOUSIER, AVE, MENDACIOUS, NEHRU, SAMOA, FAME, and LIEU were all lovely. ISLE is probably the best clue I've seen for a while!

"Finally (for now)

Mom loved G&S, something she inherited from her father. So I have a soft spot for at least the idea of their LIGHT OPERAs. But I think my favorite G&S song is by Stephen Sondheim.

Pacific Overtures is about the forced opening of Japan by Commodore Perry. Act II opens with a song called ""Please, Hello"" where the Americans return, followed by several other nations. The music matches the nations: the American sounds like a Sousa march, the French sounds vaguely can-can-esque, the Russian is in a minor key, and the British is a pitch-perfect pastiche of a G&S patter song. And each of them is accompanied by the not-so-subtle hint of a warship.

the American (and to a lesser degree the Russian and Dutch) speak with poor grammar, as they would be trying to speak Japanese. This video is from the original Bway production in 1976. I've cued it up just before the Brit sings, but you can watch the whole thing if you want. ;)

btw the Dutchman blithely uses a derogatory term, and I thought of this song every time that term [cued differently of course] showed up in the grid and subsequently in the comments. Thankfully it has not been seen for a while now.

I would respectfully posit that both THROUGH and RUE have homophones, ""threw"" and ""roux"".

On another note... for years I confused the words ""don"" and ""DOFF"".  You cannot imagine the forehead-smacking moment when I realized they are literally the words ""on"" and ""off"", preceded by a ""D"".

"In general I don't like puzzles that force me to go scrolling through the clues to look at related clues, so when I realized how integral that was to this puzzle I was expecting a slog. Pleasantly surprised that once I had several crosses it all fell enjoyably into place.

After the solve I went down several rabbit holes; I've posted the ""MENDACIty"" quote elsewhere in a reply. I'll talk Bill Bryson here, and then give other thoughts their own threads.

In the early 90s I found a remaindered book called ""The Mother Tongue: English and How It Got That Way"". Had never heard of the author, but it was a dollar well spent. The NYTimes seemed to agree: here's their review.

I haven't re-read it since my first time, and it was lent and not returned so I don't even have it on my shelves anymore. But I seem to remember something about the fact that English has more words than most languages because we steal from EVERYONE and give the slightly different versions of the words nuances. Two examples I remember were break/breach and channel/canal.  I also seem to remember a suggestion that the many ways ""-ough"" can be pronounced is at least in part based on which language the word came from.

I then went on to discover his many travel books, and enjoyed them as well.

- And what cool symmetry in the grid!! (Thanks, @Lewis, for pointing out what I did not see on my own!)

There has been plenty of praise already for the aforementioned MENDACIOUS, and for the theme. Those elements, [Not to], the cat, the Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez quote... for me, all more than made up for the gluey feeling of a noticeable amount of the fill. (Hi, @B.)

Best moment for me was, with few crosses and the clue [Untruthful], slapping down MENDACIOUS.  Not even counting the squares to see if it fit before filling it in!  And such a gorgeous word!  The combination of getting it, seeing its beauty, and actually using it, even if just in a crossword, got me feeling triumphant ‚Äì I felt like bursting out of my chair, standing tall and strutting around the room to ‚ÄúPomp And Circumstance‚Äù.

Excellent construction, clear clues, no naticks, beautifully done. Yay!

"I approached theme clues in this puzzle as I usually do, and just skipped over them.  Once I had crosses, themes were easy, and the puzzle came in under my average.  

That doesn't mean i don't thoroughly enjoy the weirdness (to borrow a Waltz word) of the English language. When we are first learning to read and speak our native tongue, it can seem impossible to predict which way a spelling will go, but we do learn it.

There are other times when spelling and speaking seem to be at odds, and it can happen a lot with foreign languages.  In an oral test when I was a kid I was asked, ""Who wrote 'Faust'""?  I had grown up listening to the Saturday Met broadcasts, and without hesitation said ""Gounod (I correctly pronounced it Goono) wrote the opera and Goethe (blush, Go-eeth) wrote the book."" I had seen only a reference in a story I was reading the day before, and didn't even know it was a play, much less how to pronounce the author's name.  (Profound look of confusion on the questioner's face.)

Spanish was a joy to pronounce: If the letters were there, you knew they were meant to be said as written. Muchas gracias y muchos besos, mis amigos y amigas!  (But after all this time, that's about all that I remember.)

"Me-ow. Meghan Morris, Meghan Morris, what can I say. I struggled my way through this puzzle. Although I might have learned some things, I also learned a lot about myself. I lack a 7 years sense of the ability to rhyme and such took far too long on this puzzle. I was also introduced to the term homophone today, and now believe that the American education system has completely failed me, and will do the same for my children. Once again, thank you for this needed challenge, and I promise you, I have learned and I will continue learning, for you.",7,negative,0.3866927921772003

"What a joy, this puzzle! I can't seem to wipe the smile off my face.
It should have been prefaced with ""WARNING: THINKING REQUIRED."" 
And I loved every minute of the thinking it required, both for the puzzle within the puzzle and for much of the fill. 

There was a lot of deleting and correcting going on for me, so my proudest moment was getting SOPHIE'S Choice just off the initial S. 
You see, I have a bad habit of sparring with the puzzle, hence on my first pass-through I cried, ""How am I supposed to know what kind of 'choice' you want from me?"" 
So of course I was elated when it popped into my head.

A bit of nostalgia set in for when I used to teach ESL in my younger years. I made a point of letting my students know that they simply had to learn the words along with their pronunciations, and not look for rules because there aren't any.  The examples in the puzzle always came up.

Thank you, Ms. Morris. This was a solid and clever puzzle, and I had a glorious time!

"consistency is the hobgoblin...

English changes.  I've listened to some radio shows from the 1940's or 50's.  Some folks then pronounced Los Angeles with a hard G.  Coupe rhymed with toupee.

"Spanish has a Royal Academy to keep spelling in line with pronunciation to a great degree. English has no such thing. So while Spanish spelling has been consistent with regard to its pronunciation for centuries, English spelling is more or less fossilized while pronunciation changes.

The biggest pronunciation shift, of course, was the Great Vowel Shift during the Middle English period (1400-1700). This took place just when spelling was being standardized thanks to the invention of the printing press, but the changes continued for centuries.

No such major shift occurred in Spanish.",22,neutral,0.8311417102813721
