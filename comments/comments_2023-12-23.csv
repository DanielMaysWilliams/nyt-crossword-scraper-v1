"I enjoyed this puzzle much more than yesterday‚Äôs. Many of those long 15 letter phrases came to me pretty easily and many proved to be right. My last tough spot was the SW section, beginning with 28A, where I had H__NDS for a very long time without realizing that the clue ‚ÄúDoes‚Äù was a plural noun and not a verb. Of course the fact that my missing ‚ÄúI‚Äù in HINDS went with another clue I was misinterpreting, where the ‚Äútopper‚Äù was actually a TILDE and not a cocktail umbrella üòù. I‚Äôve seen enough clever clues for tilde before and I should have known better. Thanks for a delightful Saturday challenge, Will Nediger.",2,positive,0.9392505288124084

With ""INDS"" from the downs, I shrugged and filled in ""Minds,"" as that was the only thing that (sorta) made sense.  But 28D definitely had to be HENRYS.

"This was a oner. I only got half a dozen short clues the first round. Intimidated by the white squares I resorted to the Hints column. Well, it‚Äôs hard to just look at one.

What‚Äôs my lesson? These days I seem to be acutely aware of how making assumptions has become such a plague it now seems to be the cultural norm.

Almost got my best time on this one, well below my average. Nice trivia about andouille sausages btw.   Kudos!",5,positive,0.9351254105567932
"Impressive in its four long stacks and abundance of white space.  I love white space.  I looked at the grid and thought: ""Boy, am I going to have fun.""

Not so fast.  I hadn't yet seen all the names I didn't know -- names that turned out to be ERIN, TYNER, BYNES and ACDELCO.  Also the geographic ones I should have known but didn't: BENIN and TALLINN.

There were times I felt despair but, hey, it's my sometime collaborator Will Nediger, and I'm nothing if not loyal, so I soldiered on.  And was rewarded with a clean solve against all odds.

I knew that the crosses of 1A would eventually reveal to me if we were talking about a TIK TOK or an INSTAGRAM-something-or-other.  But, whaddaya know, it's a PINTEREST something-or-other.  (All these sites sound exactly the same to me and I can't go and take a quick peek to see how they differ because you have to join before they let you peek.)

Join???!!!  That'll be the day.

I did have to get BOARDS without the help of BYNES, but luckily I had ?OARDS.  

Biggest writeover:  I had MOvE for the thing that's measured by the yard -- but I wouldn't let AMERICAN PAvEALE go.  And someone will tell me why a MOLE is measured by the yard -- yes?

Favorite clues:  the one for BAA BAA (it made me sing) and the one for SNEAKERS.  For the ""athletic items never purchased individually"", I wanted GOLF TEES.

Pairs well with another great pianist, Ahmad Jamal.",12,positive,0.9799699187278748
"A puzzle like this, with its magnificent content and cluing, satiates me to no end.

The fill runs the cultural gamut and inspires me to research the new (BENIN and the Kingdom of Dahomey) and to  refresh my memory on what I learned long ago (the Tudor kings.)

I always finish a puzzle like this smiling and thinking ""Yesss! I have homework!"" 

And the cluing... it fills me with awe for the constructors and editors. 
The misdirects, even more so than the puns, floor me every single time.
I revel in the feeling of, through the puzzle, being in the presence of what I consider geniuses (the same sensation I have, by the way, about the bloggers and commenters in Wordplay.)

Take something as ""simple"" as ""Europe, Asia, and America."") It's that wondrous kind of misdirect that allows for two entries with the same amount of letters, both making perfect sense. 
And the frequency with which constructors and editors come up with these just blows me away. 

Though I'm sitting, in my mind I'm standing up in ovation, clapping ferociously and yelling ""Bravo! Bravissimo!""

And the satiation is capped off with music when prompted in the grid. 
Here I leave you with the BAND Asia with their rendition of ""Orchard of Mines.""  It's not representative of their prog rock style, but IMO it's one of those covers that are even better than the original (by Globus, in this case.)

With them all clustered there, I just had to give in. I had no idea about ACDELCO, NACRE, or TYNER... Even with parts of them figured out, I just couldn't bring it home. I should have gotten TILDE but I didn't until I did. 

Oh, yeah, and HINDS... Clueless there! Funny thing is I even thought, ""I bet this is ""does"" as in - doe a deer, a female deer - but I have no recollection of every knowing the word HINDS in this context. 

Favorites: Europe, Asia and America... BANDS --  and Academic who works with many different schools, maybe... MARINE BIOLOGIST. Both made me smile. 

Also, just because it's weird, a certain large object often stored upside down fell on my husband this summer.... He's okay, thankfully, but it was a crazy series of unfortunate events. That one came to me quickly. 

Tough one, but they're always fun for me!",10,negative,0.4757101535797119
"28 Across‚Ä¶even after finishing the puzzle, I was so confused. ‚ÄúHINDS‚Äù ??? And then I looked it up and laughed. What a great clue. ‚ÄúDoes‚Äù as in‚Ä¶the plural of doe, the female deer. Which can also be called a hind. Delightful. I could only think of the third person singular verb ‚Äúdoes‚Äù",18,positive,0.8160215616226196

"I knew BENIN but I had to look up a lot of other trivia to finish today's puzzle. McCoy Tyner sounds like a fictional detective rather than a real person, and neither do I follow Grammys nor listen to jazz. And there was more of this arcane stuff. ACDELCO... I actually own an American car but it's a Mustang (yeah, I am a university professor who drives around slowly in an oldish, redneckish car - while listening to Lana Del Rey or Florence Welch; I am full of contradictions) so I have no idea what GM calls its auto parts brand in the US.

Most of the non-trivia clues I enjoyed, especially Expert with figures, as I am a huge figure skating fan. However, SUMOS as sumo wrestlers had me stumped for a long time - I actually watched a lot of sumo once with British English commentary and not once were the wrestlers refered to as SUMOS (two Americans reached yokozuna rank back then, Musashimaru and Akebono - if they featured in a puzzle, for once I would know some sports trivia).

All I know about Pinterest is that it exists, and I have no idea what a person has there, so I filled in PINTEREST BOARDS very late.

The puzzle was hard for me but only because of the multiple trivia clues. Not my favorite kind of hard, that.",6,neutral,0.550393283367157

"Very hard puzzle for me today. Had to turn on autocheck when I could get almost literally nothing in the bottom of the grid. Certainly didn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôve never heard of the bands Asia and America, but just too much fill that required guessing archaic words I didn‚Äôt know or specific knowledge I just don‚Äôt have. 

Shortlist that‚Äôs very long of words I never get without turning on autocheck and guessing letters until one lands: BENIN, ERIN, TYNER, HINDS, ACDELCO, NACRE, TILDE, HENRY, HEGEL. Just too many names you‚Äôll never guess if you don‚Äôt know them, and too hard to get the other crossers with no letters.

"Will, I would say your gambit paid off with the construction of triple stacks in the N and S. It's ironic that the seed entry was  LESS THAN STELLAR since this grid was anything but.

The triple stacks were not as daunting as they first appeared; work a few down clues and they readily come into view.

That said, I did have to think a bit more in the W, where I needed to see the TILDE in pi√±a colada to get TYNER, and I had peaRl before NACRE.

And I've already mentioned that I too had lANDS before BANDS, which led to a clock-ticking flyspeck.

I will confess that I thought 1D was 'manger' but I think I have some of my Aesop's fables confused.  There was a great deal of white space after the first go around but a couple of lucky guesses got me going.  I did like the TILDE clue.

"Look at that seal, sitting atop a marine biologist! And Hack/Media (even the Gray Lady has some resident hacks, but I'm not naming any names). And pin, thread and needle for sewing on a nacre button! And DEA/DOA; RNA/RNS. And gee, after a steady diet of IPA, we finally get an APA, first time I can remember. 

Naturally I had LANDS, not BANDS for Europe, America and Asia (all three less than stellar but you may not CONCUR). The answer caused me to look up other continents to see if there was a band named ANTARCTICA (yes, indie, 1995-99), AUSTRALIA (yes, more a band camp though), SOUTH AMERICA (no). I did notice, however, that ACDELCO breaks down into two band names: AC/DC  and ELO. 

One of the funny word games, almost like Mad Libs, I used to play with the kids when they were just getting into music, was something we called BAND NAME SESH, to come up with funny names that sounded like they could be legit band names. It was inspired by my sister who lives in Cambridge Mass, who told me she saw a flyer for a band there called Judith's Tiny Head, and the opening band for them was Relentless Barbecue. Given this grid's spread, we have at the very least:

The Dolorous Sneakers
Abnormal Petbed
Snit Mole
Red Tilde and the Sumos
The Hegel Clan

"I blanched when I saw all the dazzling white in today‚Äôs grid.  I‚Äôve learned that trying to guess long spanners is, for me at least, a mugs game.  So instead of working through the acrosses, I started with the downs and, lo and behold, I soon had enough crosses to make the top stack of spanners clear.  As is usually the case, once the long entries become clear, the rest of the puzzle opens up quickly.  The bottom stack took a bit longer, but I was helped by having on occasion bought some Sierra Nevada AMERICANPALEALE.  A nice lively puzzle, challenging enough, but still a welcome break after yesterday‚Äôs toughie.

One of the acrosses that I did know without needing crosses, was a welcome appearance by McCoy Tyner, the fine pianist who helped anchor John Coltrane‚Äôs classic quartet, and who went on to have a long career as a leader himself after Coltrane‚Äôs premature death.  No matter how far out Trane‚Äôs playing got McCoy‚Äôs playing always kept the music rooted in a sound that this listener could relate to.",24,positive,0.5404418706893921

Caitlin:

The melody to which BAA BAA Black Sheep and Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star (not to mention The Alphabet Song) are set to was not written by Mozart.  It was originally a French nursery rhyme called ""Ah! vous dirai-je, maman"" (Ah shall I tell you, Mama), upon which Mozart composed variations, as the title of the clip you posted states.  Many other classical composers have also been inspired by the music.

The words of the original French nursery rhyme was a parody of an anonymous love poem.
