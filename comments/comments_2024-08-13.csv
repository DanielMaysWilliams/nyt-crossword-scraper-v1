"I really enjoyed this puzzle, especially the reminder of Toni Morrison's wonderful body of work.  As a relatively new solver of the NYT crossword I appreciate the chance to successfully solve a puzzle in under 30 minutes without looking at the Gameplay article for any clues and today's puzzle was a great boost!  Thanks again for a nicely designed tribute puzzle.",11,positive,0.9847834706306458

"Enjoyed this puzzle, with the exception of using ""confer"" as the clue for ""lend"".   Maybe I'm old, but ""to confer"" something has always meant (to me) ""to give or grant"" with no expectation of return.   When did ""confer"" morph to mean a loan?   Anyway, thanks for honoring Ms. Morrison - she certainly deserves it!",2,positive,0.8470112681388855

"By odd coincidence, a couple days ago, I was sorting through the spare bedroom, and found a copy of *Beloved*, which I had bought a couple years ago, but never read. I've just started it--hopefully on the coming days off I will get more time.

And when I said ""a couple years ago,"" I can place that to Jan. 2, 2020, Chicago, IL: I know because I found the receipt, along with the Amtrak ticket from Detroit. And, as it happens, Jan. 2, 2020 was also the day I subscribed to the NYT XW:-)!

"Toni Morrison is surely a worthy subject for a themed crossword puzzle, but a Tuesday Times puzzle does not generally require in-depth knowledge of the works of a single author.  If this puzzle reflects a new direction, I look forward to exploring other individual artists in such depth.  The New York Times is full of surprises these days.",3,positive,0.8087648153305054

"I am pretty surprised--but mostly saddened--that so many puzzlers are unfamiliar with Toni Morrison, one of the most brilliant authors of her generation. Morrison's books are not light and easy reading, but they are rich and layered and gorgeous to read, hard work in the absolute best sense, and so important as well. Maybe, as a result of this puzzle, a few folks will consider picking up one of these books? I sure do hope so! 

Thanks, Benjamin Panico, for making me smile today. And as the queer mom of a trans teen, I especially welcome your presence as a constructor. Representation matters!",13,positive,0.7363539338111877
"I was sooooooo excited to comment on this last night right after I finished it (in sooooooo close to a new personal best) but alas it was not to be because of the missing column link. So I know I'm a bit late to the party now, but my words of tribute would likely not quite do justice anyhow, so maybe it was good to have some reflection. 

In any case, I thought this puzzle was a perfectly lovely tribute to such a beautiful and important voice! Well done in every aspect. Thank you, Mx. Panico!

I haven't read any of Toni Morrison's books, but her name and some of her titles are in my wheelhouse. 
Still, I believe that honoring a renowned and BELOVED author, Nobel laureate or not, and whether or not in my wheelhouse, is a sublime idea for a NYT puzzle, making the heart of any cruciverbalist beat a little faster.

That the constructor was able to make the crosses Tuesday-gentle-enough, hence with a revealer and themers that were easily accessible, is a testament to their talent.

My sincere thank you to Mx. Panico.

"Heaven help those of you who aren't familiar with TONI MORRISON.  But this was a breeze for me-- even though the clues were a bit harder than the usual Tuesday.  

The theme answers are unusually dense: Seven (7!!!) of them, although two of the titles are only 4-letters each.  The smoothness of the puzzle is enhanced by the fact that there's no  crosswordese and NO OTHER NAMES  in the grid (at least I don't think there are) other than the theme titles and the author.  That's always a cardinal rule for me: If your theme is built around proper names of one kind or another, leave them the bleep out of the rest of the grid.

Tribute puzzles can be boring -- but this one is kept pretty lively because of the fact that Toni's titles have a certain je ne sais quoi.  I quite liked this.",19,positive,0.8463899493217468

"Most of us born during the Truman administration weren‚Äôt reading Toni Morrison‚Äôs books during our high school, college or graduate/professional school years. Because my reading preferences during the past 50 years always have leaned to history, politics and non-fiction, I still haven‚Äôt read any of Toni Morrison‚Äôs books. I wonder how many of us in the Medicare Generation know the keys for any of Taylor Swift‚Äôs songs.

"I know I‚Äôm going to be an outlier here but I didn‚Äôt like the inclusion of Tar baby. Even in the 80s it was a vicious slur against black people. Obviously Morrison was reclaiming the word but in a crossword, terms can lose context.  That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre generally very conservative in tone and language. 

Im not Black (nor is Mr Panico) ‚Äî it‚Äôs not my ‚Äúword.‚Äù but if I saw a clue referencing Larry Kramer‚Äôs 1979 novel F@ggots, it would be upsetting. And I love that book.",7,negative,0.8254767060279846

I wasn't familiar with most of Toni Morrison's books, but I was easily able to get all of them via the crosses and solved the puzzle pretty quickly.

This was a smooth and elegant puzzle, well done!

I read Beloved a year ago, as a community read sponsored by our local library. Disturbing yet enthralling. I had a hard time following the mystical, haunting aspects, they were woven so tightly into the ""real"" parts of the story.

Just wanted to say how much I loved this puzzle. I feel so lucky to have gone to schools where we were required to read five of the six books featured in the puzzle (Jazz was published shortly after I graduated). It scares and angers me that we live in a country where those beautiful novels will never see the light of day in many schools and libraries. My whole outlook on race and humanity was changed as a young person who absorbed those stories and learned so much during classroom discussions. I, my child, and my grandchild, are better people because of it. 

Thank you, Ms. Morrison‚Ä¶and Mx. Panico!",28,positive,0.5779298543930054
"What a lovely theme! No book has affected me like THE BLUEST EYE did. It utterly destroyed me. I was not okay for weeks afterward.

"After BELOVED I practically had PTSD (no forewarning for some reason) but I should probably read some of the subsequent works.  There is no doubt in my mind that TONI MORRISON can put a read right into the story she is weaving...  

For some reason 45D did not automatically come to me....well, it *has* been 23 years since we lived in the Snow Belt east of Cleveland.  (Some friends there are still waiting to get power back for areas hit by Debby.)  There was one door to the back yard that we couldn't use until Spring; the DRIFTS were blown to that spot by the 'prevailing Westerlies.'",11,neutral,0.5087118744850159
"If you're not from the US, i guess you get a pass on not knowing Toni Morrison, but she's a frequent clue in the NYT crossword. But anyone complaining about a puzzle this easy as an American, I just literally don't understand. The Bluest Eye and Beloved are taught regularly in schools. Song of Solomon was a clue so easy you didn't need to know anything about the author. The NE corner with maybe the least known book had also the most obvious word and another easy clue without any book knowledge (1920s Harlem!). Sula was entirely done by crosses for me such that I never even read the clue, so i can't speak to that one, but again the crosses were so straightforward that it doesn't even matter.

This was way too easy to be a Thursday puzzle (as some have suggested) and belongs where it was slotted. I still finished it 20% below usual Tuesday time. Ppl really will complain about anything. I think the only forced oddity in there was OY.

I personally really appreciated the theme -- not gimmicky or tricky, just a nod to one of the best known and celebrated American authors, and kudos for getting all the book titles in there.",36,neutral,0.5516778230667114
"A debut and a fine and well executed tribute puzzle.  A lot to like here.  Not as well read as I should be but managed to remember the titles soon enough. 

For some reason LANAI came hard as I only know them as the screened structures folks in Florida put over their pools so they an actually use them.  

The rest area on the Garden State Parkway near us was earmarked to be named after the BELOVED author, a New Jersey Hall of Famer, but apparently the details could not be worked out with her estate.  The honor went instead to Bruce Willis.",15,positive,0.8703795671463013
"Some are calling this theme ‚Äújust a list‚Äù and I suppose it is. But since I thought it was a terrific Tuesday, I guess that works for me.

So thanks, Benjamin and congratulations on a a lovely debut.",27,positive,0.9183998107910156
"Interesting that the author's name and the titles of her first six novels accommodate the symmetry required in the grid. JAZZ pairs with SULA, THEBLUESTEYE pairs with TONIMORRISON, TARBABY pairs with BELOVED, and SONGOFSOLOMON has thirteen letters, allowing it to ""pair with itself"" as a central thematic entry.

Given the constraints imposed by the thematic entries, the remaining fill is a bit bland, though LANAI, MARTYR and MISHAP are interesting words. 

Congrats on the debut!",21,positive,0.7089422345161438
"I haven't read any Toni Morrison, but now I will, so thanks for that. I've already borrowed or put on hold a few books in Libby.

I found completing the puzzle fairly straightforward, because all the titles, except SULA (which thankfully had no tricky crosses), were easily guessable words or phrases for me. 

Once I filled in TONIMORRISON from a few crosses, I able to get BELOVED, the only book title I know of hers. Also, SONGOFSOLOMON was a gimme for me, as I was force-fed a lot of bible when I was a kid, and I knew it as a book title, although was not aware it was Morrison's.

Thanks to the constructor for this puzzle. I took a literature class in college that focused on US Nobel Prize winners, but it was too many years ago to include Morrison, so I'm happy to add her to my reading list. 

And that reminds me that I should do some research about other recent US literary Nobelists, because now my knowledge gap is gonna bug me.",17,positive,0.7026722431182861

"What a joy. One of my favourite authors so naturally the clues fell very easily for me. I‚Äôve read and RETURNED to her novels so many times. Her writing is so intelligent, beautifully descriptive and gets to the heart of the human condition. There is something new to discover with every reading. If you haven‚Äôt come across her work, do try it, though I warn you she doesn‚Äôt shy away from the difficulties (and some are distressingly extreme) that her characters must endure. I think my favourite is BELOVED. While arguably one of the most difficult subjects (I‚Äôm not sure the emus will pass my post if I list them), it is also the most uplifting.

The rest of the puzzle filled quickly for me. TIL what a LANAI actually is; it comes up frequently in Spelling Bee, but I‚Äôve never bothered checking what it is. 

Like some of you I wanted dog for MAT. Though he doesn‚Äôt so much greet, as demand payment for the unmitigated gall of having left him behind.",19,positive,0.964597225189209

I read Tar Baby long ago, but would not have remembered who the author was if you asked me. Good to have the frequent xw answer of TONI fleshed out. Maybe that could be an occasional Tues or Wed theme idea: ‚ÄúCrosswordese: I Hardly Knew Ya.‚Äù",6,neutral,0.6474406719207764

"I hadn't heard of any of the books, but that's fine. My only gripe was ""OYS"" for ""pained cries"". ""OWS"" would be a much more obvious answer, and my searching even seems to indicate that OY is a variant of OI, which isn't a pained cry at all. Perhaps it is intended as a variant of ""oy vey""? Seems like a stretch but happy to be corrected.",9,neutral,0.5893882513046265
"Very enjoyable puzzle and one that seems quite appropriate at this moment in time. I've read most of them and still have some of them in storage somewhere, but still needed some crosses for some of the titles to dawn on me. That's just my memory. 

I guess it's understandable, but still kind of sad to see that so many commenters were unfamiliar with the author and her work.

"Like others here so far, I haven‚Äôt read many of Ms Morrison‚Äôs books and needed almost all the crossings to solve this, which made this feel significantly harder than a typical Tuesday.

I nearly got to the end without any assists, but the crossing of EBON (really?!) and OYS (OwS or even OhS seemed equally likely to me) made it impossible for me to infer the last 2 letters of TAR BA__, which in the end I gave up trying to guess and had to look up to finish the puzzle.

Still a good learning experience overall, but I think some of the cluing and crosses could have been tuned just a tad more for an early week puzzle.",14,negative,0.552478551864624

"I love Toni Morrison‚Äôs novels, so this crossword was a pleasure‚Äîand a nice tribute to a great writer.",26,positive,0.9856181740760803
I think having to know all the Toni Morrison novels is a bit much for Tuesday.  The crossings helped me get all of them without having to look anything up though. I would say this puzzle is Wednesdayish in terms of difficulty.,9,neutral,0.5664299130439758
"Only three comments so far? Maybe because the Wordplay link in the app was broken. (At least for me.)

I'm not too familiar with Morrison's work but managed to make it through pretty easily.",7,negative,0.5327017307281494
Pretty difficult for a Tuesday considering the whole theme with a lot of entries revolves around one author. I've never heard of the author and I got some answers from crosses then googled the name to fill in the rest of the titles.,7,negative,0.6200780272483826
"Congratulations on a nice NYT debut, Mr. Panico! I don‚Äôt know much about Toni Morrison‚Äôs writing, but my ignorance didn‚Äôt hinder me. Thanks for the reminder to fill that gap in my reading.",8,positive,0.9200493693351746
