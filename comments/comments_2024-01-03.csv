BOREPEATING -- it go too boring to repeat the RE

FAREDUCTION -- we'll reduce the fare by eliminating the extra RE

""When I first started doing crosswords, I held fast to the romanticism of pen-and-paper solving""
Being exclusively an on-line solver--mainly on PC, sometimes on i-Pad or Android phone--I'm always surprised by the number of people who solve in pen-and-paper, but then come on-line to poist comments. espite that being the M.O. of two of my favorite commenters--one of whom has a handle which begins M.O. . . .

Now, when I try solve on pen and paper, I get frustrated with the inability to quickly erase and replace entries; but then, working other puzzles, I get frustrated by other publisher's differences in use of arrow-key shortcuts, auto-advance, etc.

And although one publisher offers a cute (albeit repetetive) cartoon upon successful completion, it's not nearly as satisfying as the Happy Music.  Sometimes, just before entering the last square, I'll announce to my Partner ""I'm going to make it ring!""; sometimes he'll sing along, although usually he just rolls his eyes. And sometimes, if I'm solving in bed, I'll get up and get the headphones, just so it doesn't wake him.

And with pen-and-paper solvers, when they've fully filled in the grid, how do they know that artist isn't M. C. Wyeth, living in Matick, MA?  Dumb question, but when does the print edition of the NYT publish the solution to the dailies--that day or the next?  It's been so long, I can't remember.",6,neutral,0.6542387008666992

"A quirky puzzle, and a portal back to 1980...there's American GIGOLO, Richard Gere slouching toward bed-lehem, and BO (repeating) over DEREK, and there IS something utterly repetitious, come to think of it, about that movie ""10"" (1979), the constant swelling of ""Bolero"" ain't it claro, left me feeling an eeny bit AT SEA...so memorable yet at the same time so forgettable... and although every year brings a coup or two, the 1980s were rife with coup attempts and coups d'etats, especially in Africa, and of course were sometimes subsidized by our BOYS running their SHAM Iran Scam, but they were oddly fire resistant, weren't they, those Oliver North sorts, they refused to say zip when confronted; they were, by nature, reserved, just stuck their chests out and stayed mum, no matter how much they shook their maracas, coached to just shut their eyes and think of something else.

You know what they mainly thought of? Having dozens of BBQ wings the way they do 'em in The Lou, maybe a brew, some Breyer's chocolate chip afterward, Eartha Kitt on the juke box in that bar...what was it called? Oho...MacBeth's --",22,neutral,0.5846307873725891
"I did a double take on MC JOB and thought ""Poor emcees, being used to derisively portray mundane employment..."" as I shook my head in heartfelt sympathy.

Well, thank goodness for the column! [Face palm.]

Other than that slight brain freeze fiasco, the rest came easily and the solve was smooth, quick, and really enjoyable, with the theme entries making sense from the get-go. 
I must have been on the same wavelength.

This puzzle was a true gem.

Thank you, Mr. Goudsmit!",19,positive,0.43644624948501587
"When I left Kansas City (on the Kansas side) in 1996, St. Louis had always been considered the larger and more important metropolitan area, especially politically. KC was often slighted when it came to state funding and projects. Haven't kept track of Missouri politics, etc., since I moved away, so I was surprised to hear that STL was now considered the second largest, and I had been trying to figure out a nickname for KC (fail).

Most of the puzzle was fairly easy, but there were a few sticking points, esp. the above. No trouble with the theme entries, though.

Nice puzzle, Jared, and thanks.",11,neutral,0.7467024326324463

"I see the constructor lived in St Louis so he must know what he is talking about.  But I lived in Columbia MO for years, and never heard it called 'The Lou.'  Mind you, as a native Brit I suppose my friends did not want to tell me they were on their way to 'The Lou' in case I misunderstood them.  Could be.",27,neutral,0.8005545735359192
"Looks like Jared is being set up for a specialist role at the Times Crossword. This, his second puzzle, is a Wednesday with letters in themers that need to be used twice. His debut was a Wednesday with themers containing pairs of rebuses. Watch out for his next Wednesday!

Jared: I that a theatre major I see before me in 45D? And a poli sci major at 37D?  Both good majors for crossword constructors and editors!

"My father liked to think of himself as worldly, but he was at times startlingly na√Øve. After he returned from his first trip to Europe, which included a tour of Heidelberg, he told me breathlessly that Mensa was such a huge organization in Germany that it had a building of its own on every university campus. I didn't have the heart to tell him that in German, ""Mensa"" means ""cafeteria.""",83,neutral,0.7612531185150146
