But, what I was really wondering about was... do only us boomers recall the original version of that rhyme? That just 
makes it extremely objectionable.

"Oh, my heart.

I am bad a so very many things. 
I am good at a few, 
and great at *one*.

One thing.

Claw machines. 

My boys would always be allowed a quarter at the
diner we went to quite often. 
The claw machine was in the entryway.

They started giving me their quarters, because
they preferred to get a cheap toy than to actually play.

But I‚Äôm too good. 
(My record was getting 3 toys with one grab.)

But the toys began to collect in the back of our car.
So the rule was that whatever we won 
had to be given away, immediately.

They‚Äôd look around the restaurant, 
find a child or two, an elderly man, our waitress‚Ä¶ 
Presenting strangers with little surprise gifts 
became the best part.

Then, as they grew, 
they both surpassed me with their skills!

Now, both boys are nearly 30.
Neither can pass a claw machine without 
popping in a quarter, and 
leaving a toy for the next child who
happens to pass by the machine.

Would I have liked for my supreme talent to have
been, 
I dunno, 
balancing a checkbook?
Running marathons?
Keeping a spotless house?
Finding cures for diseases?

There are no alternatives to Ticketmaster, which is the whole problem.

"Cute puzzle, although I have to look pretty hard to see a claw machine in the grid.  I knew about NUDIE Cohn, courtesy of the Ken Burns documentary on country music.  The first singer I ever saw in person wearing a Nudie suit was Gram Parsons at the Bijou Cafe in Philadelphia shortly before his untimely death.",14,positive,0.7600651383399963
"Breezy puzzle, but both ‚ÄúAMUSEMENT ARCADE‚Äù and ‚ÄúCLAW MACHINE GAME‚Äù felt oddly redundant to me. I know them as Arcades and Claw Machines, respectively.",45,negative,0.5634565949440002
