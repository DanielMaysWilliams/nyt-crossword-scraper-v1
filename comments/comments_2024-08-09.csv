"I'd say my absolute favorite kind of puzzle: almost NOTHING on the first pass; GROAN;  then just a few; then more because the crosses are kind; more; finally ALL DONE with no look-ups (though I'm not fanatically against them, mind you).
  There weren't too many proper nouns, but I didn't know most of them (14A 18A 45A 6D). I did know 47A--been seen recently in other puzzles anyway), and I consider myself woke enough to know 38A and 43A.
  I will never know Marvel comics, having had a violently ant-comics mother.  She went ballistic when I reported in 5th grade that I had filled out a survey and said I'd read more comics that year than in previous year. This was honest, but totally because I was spending more time in an orthodontist's waiting room--the only place I ever encountered comics.

I usually can't see right away where it went and don't want to take the time to scrutinize every entry. So I type it again in the right spot, and only find out where the letter zoomed off to when I finish the puzzle and am told there's a mistake somewhere.

"I've read the comments and see that most thought this was  easy. My experience was mixed. For about 3/4 of it, I thought I'd have a personal best for Friday. But then I came to a screeching halt. Everything north of TULSA (a gimme for me) at 38A was really hard won. So basically, that section took me more time than the rest of the puzzle did. 

But when I got it all in (without any help), I felt extremely happy and accomplished! And so I give myself a customary, HUZZAH!!!!

Does it matter that so many others found it really easy? I don't know, I know that my experience was similar for much of the puzzle, and I know I couldn't have done this without help six months ago. I know there are competitions out there but I'm only competing against myself, so it's all good! 

Having A grades and strata instead of APLUSES and BTEAMS really set me back so in and out they went. I did have TONES, SNIDE and MIST but had a hard time with crosses. The E instead of o in IDOLATERS threw me a bit. And I was thinking along the lines of impatience for toe tapping. Victory when I finally remembered SPIN, which gave me P in IMPOSSIBLE, which helped me settle on UM NO, instead of debating Uh, oh, etc. And from there it fell. BERGS was last and made me laugh when I got it! Nice!!

Favorites: KNOT and IDOS next to each other, SOBER, MAYI, and ANTE.

Also, KINK SHAME because I didn't know that phase and TULSA because too many don't know about it.

"Hemant is on my can’t-miss list of constructors, and this after only his eighth NYT puzzle.  

One reason is his craftsmanship.  Today, for instance, we have a 70-word, 30-block grid, meaning seas of white, and where is the ugliness?  Where? This is extraordinarily difficult to bring off, and he does it every time.

He does this not by focusing on time-worn words that are friendly to constructors but boring to solvers, but rather on words that have never showed up in puzzles before, which pays off so wonderfully for solvers.

Hemant specializes in this.  He averages a bit over eight Times answer debuts per puzzle.  Today he had 10, including such lovely additions to the oeuvre as GO OUT ON TOP, I MISSED YOU, KINKSHAME, and LET ME EXPLAIN.

In addition, he has the cluing knack, peppering his puzzles with original beauties.  Today, for instance, he took an answer that has appeared in puzzles well more than a thousand times – ANTE – and gave it a no-one-has-ever-come-up-with-anything-like-this clue: [Entry fee for some clubs?].

"Odd and ODDER when I'm just thinking about having a PB&J and here's Deb talkin' peanut butter analogies. Dash it, I'm going down right now to get me one (blackberry preserves and Skippy on whitebread)! 

Working among indie rockers, who remind me sometimes of Lubavitcher jews in the purity of their orthodoxy, I've learned that bands like the Black Keys & White Stripes might start off as indie, but if they sign to commercial labels and start putting out songs played on commercial radio, or which sound like they should be on commercial radio, they're no longer indie. Just as Judaism is both a culture and a religion, so indie rock is both a kind of sound, content, technique and production values of the music itself, and also about the lifestyle choices and financial & business considerations the rockers make. My colleagues would certainly speak in SNIDE TONES about the Keys and the Stripes. If they were playing this puzzle there would have been a lot of LET ME EXPLAIN.

That said, there are some GREAT potential indie band names in this puzzle:

The Idolaters
The Footlongs
Torso
Tom's H-BOMB
The B-Teams
Duress

So, lots of good symmetry, which is probably why it was so smooth. Jiffy-style.",34,neutral,0.5247848033905029
"Woohoo!  I beat my average by 53%.  Didn’t get much on the first pass, but speed picked up after I made a few guesses that paid off.",5,positive,0.9767643809318542
"Yesterday was my first Thursday without a lookup, today was my first Friday without a lookup. Either this week’s puzzles were a little easier than normal or I’m finally seeing personal improvement. Either way, I’m quite happy! Enjoyed this one quite a bit.",21,positive,0.9642111659049988
Fun puzzle and the original kink shame clue was great.  Just a minute of two off my PB for a Friday.  I must have been on the same wavelength as the creator as this flowed like smooth peanut butter…,8,positive,0.9700766801834106
"No lookups, close to my best time for a Friday.  Good peanut butter, but not very crunchy.",3,positive,0.9195407629013062
"11:29 with no hints, which is incredible for me for a Friday. Actually found yesterday's much harder 🤣",4,positive,0.7736199498176575
"Yes, your clue for KINKSHAME would have been more fun.",9,neutral,0.38216859102249146
"Fun puzzle, but pretty straightforward. I thought it would be harder, but it just opened up for me.  I enjoyed it, but would not group it with some of the great crunchy puzzles I have enjoyed over the years.",2,positive,0.9590856432914734
I never sent a 29 across but I recall my father talking about them. That is a word I have not heard in a long time.,6,neutral,0.5907828211784363
"A little too quick for a Friday imo.  Don’t get me wrong, it was a great puzzle with a lot of really clever clues, but Friday-level difficulty it was not.  Hoping for a crunchy/chewy Saturday!",9,positive,0.5199260115623474
"“Bad news from a mâitre d’” - made me laugh to think of the possibilities:

FLOP - status of the daily special
BOSS - warning of unexpected diner
FIRE - kitchen is closed
LACK - favorite liquor is on backorder
LOST - status of your checked coat
OKRA - today's vegetable",33,negative,0.7041113972663879
"There were lots of bright clues and fun answers tonight. I caught a break with a couple of music clues (INDIEBANDS and SPIN) and more or less solved the puzzle in a clockwise fashion, finishing up in the middle of the left side of the puzzle. The longish downs were hard enough to challenge me a bit, but really opened up the puzzle for me (especially GLASSTUMBLER).",8,positive,0.9636569619178772
"Crunchy? Not really. 

Fun? Absolutely. The clueing was just challenging enough to make me think, but not so hard that I got stuck anywhere.",53,neutral,0.43629589676856995
"Starting to look grim when I got all the way to 33A before coming up with anything, but then it went pretty smoothly. Nice fill, but they always end up putting an OREO in there somewhere, amirite? ;-)",16,positive,0.43602126836776733
"Chewy?  Really?

Nice puzzle (as usual from Mr. Mehta) but this was a Wednesday run two days late.",12,positive,0.4331359565258026
"Personal best for a Fri, not a single lookup. Not that I think it was easy, I was just on the right wavelength somehow with Mr Mehta. Love the long fills.",24,positive,0.9165112972259521
"Thanks Mr. Mehta, enjoyed that.",11,positive,0.9755634665489197
