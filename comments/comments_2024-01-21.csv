"Hi, new to the Wordplay community, been doing the puzzles here for a few months now. Really enjoyed Sunday‚Äôs puzzle as I like that sort of wordplay (one could say)‚Ä¶ do you all read the first part of the column before starting, or just jump right in?",2,positive,0.9761098623275757
"Well, I am frustrated. I completed the puzzle in an under-average time, and rechecked all my answers, but no congratulations message appeared. I rechecked my answers four or five more times, making sure there were no zeroes in place of ""O's."" 

Finally, I threw in the towel and pressed ""Reveal,"" expecting to show I square that I had somehow missed. Instead, when I pressed ""Reveal,"" up came the ""Congratulations"" screen. It did not mark any errors, and I changed nothing.

But when I checked the Crossword Archives, it showed that I had not earned my Gold Star, and my lengthy streak of solved puzzles was broken.

Wow, am I  upset by this bug, or glitch or whatever.

1) The OED for HOMIE (just one of several senses of the word): ""a member of one's peer group or gang.""

2) https://linguaholic.com/linguablog/broski-meaning/ for ""Broski"": ‚ÄúBroski‚Äù is another term for ‚Äúbro,‚Äù which is just short for ‚Äúbrother.‚Äù It is used to refer to someone who is a close friend and compatriot, someone so close that they are practically a brother.

"Enjoyable Sunday puzzle. Not too hard, not too easy. Why did it take me such a long time to figure out purchase printout? I kept thinking about why one would buy a printout?  Also I liked the two Yiddish words starting with the same t. Fun. I even knew about kiting checks, don't ask me how.",15,positive,0.8165397644042969

"Pleasantly difficult, indeed. It felt like more of a challenge than most recent Sundays have been. I had several areas where I had to go back and think about the words and try some different combinations before things clicked. And areas where I just couldn't think of anything, or the actual answer just wasn't jibing with the way my brain was working. LOCALE for backdrop, for example.",19,negative,0.8105993270874023

"Fun puzzle. Halfway between my best and my average. I blipped over the themers to start. When I got enough crossing letters to clue me into the first one, the rest rapidly fell. 

I really liked STRAUSS, which took me a hot minute to figure out as I kept running through jeans brands in my head. I also really appreciated BUSINESSSCHOOL with its three consecutive S's and BAREESSENTIALS as well.",18,positive,0.8455871343612671

I‚Äôll put a pin in it for now. Clearly I‚Äôd need to circle back with Lustig and Shortz for a touchbase because my attempts are just the low-hanging fruit.

Awfully fun puzzle. Thank you!",71,negative,0.7143136262893677
