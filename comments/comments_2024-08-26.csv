"For all the comments about conflating rumba with ZUMBA, am I the only one who had the opposite experience??

There have been other grids where I was eager to enter Zumba, only to have the solve go a different direction. Like ""taebo"": also a fitness class, 5 letters, also with a B in the same position.

Today, cautious, I tried 14D... only to pass it up, unconvinced. But a peek at 6D reaffirmed my conviction: ZUMBA it is! Woo hoo!! (And while I'm sure there are classes for learning rumba, I'd be hard-pressed to label that a *fitness program*...)

Elsewhere I commented:
I loved LEAP crossing SPIN -- and only wish ZUMBA were closer in the grid! 

Now I'm thinking all the themers could potentially be part of a Zumba¬Æ routine! Abba and 'N Sync are probably givens, and the Beach Boys in a Zumba Gold class somewhere for sure.

I was fit to be tied when I saw the theme clues and had my arm already cocked in the ""throw against wall"" position when I realized that all those title words from pop songs I didn't know were going to be filled in not once, not twice, but THREE times!  Yay!  Even if I'd been living under a rock (pun intended) I would have been able to figure it out with just a few crosses.

Let it never be said that pop song titles are sophisticated.  I mean where are your ""Begin the Beguine""s, your ""Some Enchanted Evening""s, your ""Don't Rain On My Parade""s?  But here, the simplemindedness of the titles was a godsend  -- at least for me.

The revealer is terrific, though.

"I grew up playing Scrabble with my parents and still love the game. We played a slightly looser version than the printed rules: had a good sized Webster's 2nd International nearby and anyone could use it to make sure a word was spelled correctly, and there were thus no ""challenges,"" but we did believe in the honor system: you couldn't just go fishing for words. It certainly improved my vocabulary.

I think I broke 500 in a two person game just once. 503 if memory serves, but quite often I scored in the high 400s. But I know that at the higher levels, top Scrabble players score 500 like it was nothing. They would ZIP BY me with ease.

For a while I enjoyed playing online Scrabble on Facebook, because you could actually chat with random people and strike up a conversation. Then they changed the rules, probably because there were issues -- stalkers and creeps and cheaters -- and made it harder to play with any enjoyment. Then Scrabble was replaced with Words with Friends which was not the same. Some of my buddies continued to play online at sites in Estonia, Romania and Russia, and maybe they still do. 

Like everything online, online Scrabble got stale, weird, corporatized, monetized, creepy. Thank got all you need is a board, 100 tiles, a pot of hot tea or a couple beers and a bowl of chips, a pad, and a friend and life is good again.
