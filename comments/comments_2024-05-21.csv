"Latin words ending in -tas/-tatis or -itas/-itatis are all abstract nouns describing the quality of the stem word.
vanitas/vanitatis - vanity, uselessness
caritas/caritatis - charity, caring
humilitas/humilitatis - humility, abasement

As these examples show, they come into English directly. They also come into romance languages: Spanish caridad, French vanit√©. With a standard confusion of L for R (see Spanish arbor-arbol; peligro-peril), the Sicilians transformed humilitas into omert√† (that accent grave at the end is important), submitting oneself to the greater good of the organization, which then becomes synonymous with keeping your trap shut.",10,neutral,0.8039073944091797

"I did this puzzle while eating a very delicious bagel. I want to assure you all that my husband paid for it. 

I think...  I didn't actually witness him purchasing it... Hmm. Perhaps he's been down in the dumps and gone foraging in dumpsters. Guess I'll have to confront him later. 

This puzzle triggered my new found fear of the word SERGEANT from yesterday's puzzle (I think it was yesterday--I've been playing catch-up on my puzzles), in which I realized I'm terrible at spelling that word! No joke, I just misspelled it three times in this comment. I went to check on it in Google and I misspelled it there! What's wrong with me!? (Don't answer that!) 

Anyhow, I put SERGio instead of SERGEI, which contributed to the only trouble in the puzzle for me‚Äîthe lower left. Since I'm definitely not part of the mafia and I definitely do not know anything about anything, I also didn't know OMERTA at all! And I thought OH NEAT was so NEAT. I definitely did not know the video game. So that was a tough corner. I'm not quite sure how it came together but it did. In the end though, no happy music. I consulted Sam's article and realized I had GEN ZEe. I'd thought that was odd when I entered it but I also didn't know SERVO, so there we are.

"Oh, this puzzle brought memories of having a baby in the house, how a tiny, tiny being can transform a house, the blissful feel of holding a baby, how life routines completely transform, and all the stuff you get and keep getting to serve that tiny, tiny being.

And then, how junk calls started creeping in, then dominating, finally forcing the death of the landline, at least in our case.

And it brought little serendipitous touches I liked.  The abutting EDSEL and INEPT.  ACED near CRIB NOTES.  The funny-looking QUANDA, GENZER, and triple-S GUESSSO.  Plus, an EASES up, and a middle AGE. Speaking of which, that AGE nicely balanced off all the baby stuff.
