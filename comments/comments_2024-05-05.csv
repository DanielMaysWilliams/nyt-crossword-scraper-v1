No matter.  I never care about grid art anyway.  This is such an enjoyable puzzle with or without it.  Even the most mundane words were clued in an interesting way.  One example.  I pondered: Is ""fourscore"" one word or two?  If it's one, then the answer to 19A is AGO.  If it's two, then the answer is OUR.  I decided it was one.

Fun! But over way too soon. My fastest Sunday time ever. Usually I don't rush through but when it all falls into place easily I do try and see if I can beat my record. Enjoy your Sunday!,8,positive,0.9718042016029358

"Aw man, that Rocket Man is now worming its way into my ear. Which is fine. Gotta love it!

Cool puzzle, I put my ski boots on and slalomed from the summit down to earth. Loved some of the little witticisms in the placement of words and counter-narratives. Like vibratos next to those quaking aspens, and that ""T"" below the rocket in the grid, as in ""T-minus..."" The hearty dose of the feminine -- eggs, teats, bras, tampons -- caused me to reflect on male and female representations in this puzzle, but that's a fool's errand: sometimes a silo is just a silo. However, if there is a war between the sexes, and they play a baseball game to determine the winner, who would you pick to win from this puzzle's lineup?

THE ROCKETMEN

Trent Lott
Goya
Nixon
Robert Reich
Elton John
Tommy Lee Jones
Len Deighton
Martin Amis
POTUS (Biden)

THE MANBAGGERS

Sybil
Suni Lee
Hera
Shirley Dinsdale
Jane Roe (as in ""vs. Wade"")
Ayn Rand
Sharona
Posh Spice (Victoria Beckham)
The Singing Nun

Fanduel: Manbaggers -140; Rocketmen +270

By counter-narrative, there is the dazzling narrative arc of the blast off, the orbiting the moon, the collecting of specimens, the return. But meanwhile back on earth, the OCEANIC world is just as risky and filled with unknowns; you could be peacefully sailing one day, and the next, you're walking the plank with your manbag weighted down with lead. Or it's April 1912, your unit's on the top tier, and you spot what looks like an ice cap in the waves off to the lee...",20,positive,0.9075751304626465
"The grid art may ""delineate a spacecraft whose nose cone is a little triangle of black squares"", but for the life of me every time I look at it I see the face of a goat.

Good puzzle, though.  :)",14,neutral,0.5156408548355103
"Fun, did better than I would have thought, at first I thought it was going to be too much math.

"""Dominates Slangily"" should not be OWNS but rather PWNS. One of the definitions of ""own"" may be to have power or mastery over, as in wanting to own one's own life, but if it is clued in terms of slang, it is necessarily a reference to the term online gamers have popularized for trouncing an opponent, and that version is spelled with a p.

"One of those relaxing puzzles where you never have to stop writing until you finally hit a wall and have to admit you just got too cocky.  I  almost went down with the Titanic, but realized that was an OCEANIC error, took flight and finished it. 

Perfect for a Sunday this Saturday afternoon. Torrential rain this morning and now all this brilliant sunshine has made me drowsy.

"Friendly notes for Wordplay column editors:

1. ‚ÄúThey drift down from the top of the grid, and several help delineate a spacecraft whose nose cone is a little triangle of black squares that appear beneath 79-Down.‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt see a 79-Down in today‚Äôs puzzle.

2. ‚Äú(I might be alone here, but I first thought this entry was ‚Äúall systems go.‚Äù Fitting, but too straightforward for the theme.)‚Äù 

An odd parenthetical to include given that the clue reads, ‚ÄúWoo-hoo! The engines are firing, all systems are go, and we are feeling good!‚Äù
