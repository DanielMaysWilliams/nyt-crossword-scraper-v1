""Sergeant"" in French is ""Sergent""

In German, it's ""Sergeant""

If you want to translate RAKES IT IN into Gen-Z (my kids' age group), you will want to say MAKES BANK.  If you were raised by the Greatest Generation, as I was, you will have heard SNAKE EYES quite a bit, along with many other references to gambling games.  Being a Gen-X guy, I use D&D references

Count me among those who got SERGEANT wrong on the first pass through. Maybe Jack should have changed his clue to “common misspelling of a Beatles infantry leader” and just left his original grid alone.,11,negative,0.8560233116149902

"Amusing theme!

I just gotta say, Dang, Colonel Sanders, you got moded!

Does anyone remember ""moded""? Google tells me it was mostly a California thing in the '70s and '80s with a brief comeback in the '90s.

It basically meant burned or humiliated. And it may or may not have derived from ""demoted"". Which is probably why I thought of it.

I also found that there was a phrase ""Moded, corroded, your butt exploded"".

"I hoped that the military titles -- hardly all that interesting in themselves -- would be justified by the revealer. So I spent my time trying to guess the revealer in advance.  And I couldn't.

But my excuse is that I've never heard the expression YOU AND WHAT ARMY?  I've only heard the expression YOU AND WHO ELSE?  When YOU AND WHAT ARMY came in, I enjoyed the joke.  The joke being, of course, that none of these characters leads a real army, not being real themselves.  I found it quite an amusing revealer.

And now a word about CAPTAIN OBVIOUS.  

He's a mascot for Hotels.com???  Why on earth would I ever want to stay at a hotel that boasts such a mascot?  ""You need fresh towels?  It should be obvious where to find them.""  ""You're looking for our dining room?  It should be obvious what floor it's on.""  No, CAPTAIN OBVIOUS is the last hotel mascot I'd be looking for.  I'd so much prefer...

"A nice Monday puzzle, but 59A “Yucatan people of old” needed editing.

"Hah!  A theme based on not only wordplay, but silliness as well.  Not only a riddle to crack, but humor to amuse.  That is, a treat!

And a debut.  The constructor indicates that he is anxious to make more puzzles.  That makes me happy, as I’m intrigued to see more from the mind that made this puzzle.  

SERGEANT PEPPER thrust me back to the era when I must have listened to that album hundreds of times, each time fully involved and thrilled.  What a gift to get right back into what it felt like to be me back then!  The sensational CAPTAIN OBVIOUS and YOU AND WHAT ARMY buoyed, lifted the entire solving experience.  The joke behind the theme – military people who aren’t military at all – so elegantly punch-lined in the reveal, elevated my fill-in from enjoyable to scintillating.

Congratulations on your debut, Jack.  What a treat – thank you so much for making this!",17,positive,0.9764264822006226

"Ground control to Major Tom - fun puzzle and a smooth solve. Right up my alley. Re: 38a - I would have gone with battalion in the clue rather than brigade and... don't call me 'surely.' 

One rather interesting answer history search result today. I've come across some things like this before, though I don't recall anything else specifically. Anyway - I did a search for ONEG, wondering how often it had been clued to force of gravity vs. blood type. And... that varies, but what stood out was....

...that answer has appeared 54 times in Shortz era puzzles, and... only ONCE in a pre-Shortz puzzle. Has to be some kind of change in standards or something - just can't figure out what it might be. 

And, another puzzle find that I may put in a reply.
