For the record, I'm a staunch member of team Rebus, and take full responsibility for not knowing sports trivia (yesterday's SE corner nearly defeated me). 

Today's theme was right up my alley, as I'm a musician and music teacher. Much help when I grokked the theme about halfway through and was able to fill the rest of the edge in easily. (Let's hear it for solf√®ge!) But a nasty stack in the SW added a ton of flyspecking time to today's ticker: I had ORReN/ODiA instead of ORRIN/ODEA and it was a while before I checked the clue--or even looked at--54D.

You see, Peter, the brilliance of your construction left me, the solver, with nothing to do but fill in the puzzle.  No muss, no fuss, no bother.  Nothing to ""puzzle out"".  But what if all those RINGTONES had gone, unclued, in black squares ringing the puzzle?  Or, alternatively, if they were to be written outside the perimeter of the puzzle?  Plenty for the solver to have to figure out!

That YUL/GUTE crossing was nearly the death of me. I could see him in my mind but couldn‚Äôt think of his name.

"Thank you for the trip down memory lane - I clicked on the link to Mr. Gordon's 1993 Sunday puzzle, and it all came back. From the deepest layer of cerebral cortex, the Sunday puzzle's rainbow rebus brought back vivid memories of my first year out of college; living in my own apartment, too poor to afford a bottle of wine I came to appreciate after taking a wine appreciation class instead turned my interest into savoring good coffee. My Sunday morning routine was to take a quick walk to the nearby newsstand to buy the Sunday paper, brew a good cup of coffee and begin solving the Sunday crossword. Back then, I would struggle and it would take me an entire week to crack the puzzle if I was lucky. I've just begun solving crossword around that time and I remember this particular puzzle very well - it was one of the first rebuses I've encountered. Once I realized I could squeeze in letters into one square, I colored them in instead. 
The color filled squares, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, the clanging of hot water radiator of the apartment... as I started filling the squares tonight, this time on screen, they all came back along with answers like Violets Are Blue (123A), Geegaws (51A), but clues for Carnac (22A) and Cat (91D) needed a little refresher. Johnny Carson had just retired and Socks was the White House Cat back then. 
Was FALA a nod to Socks from the puzzle by any chance?",16,positive,0.8983373641967773
"Had little difficulty in solving this (23:07, about 2/3 of my avg. Wed. time), just using crosses and educated guesses,  without understanding the theme at all, then about 5 minutes staring at the grid til I 'got it'.   

I've always spelled the 5th scale tone 'sol', but a quick googling does seem to indicate that 'SO' is at least as common and correct.",3,neutral,0.5730531811714172
"SNORRI was a gimme, strangely enough - thanks to Cat Jarman's ""River Kings"" book about the Vikings that I recently read (really interesting and well written, and a must-read for people who like me are fascinated by non-fiction investigations of historical links between people, cultures and places). The senator, school and AIDS researcher I had to get from the crosses. Some trivia I looked up, especially in the trivia-heavy W half of the puzzle.

Even though I know the ""do re mi fa sol la ti do"" thing - those names are the only thing I remember from the incredibly useless music lessons in 1980s Polish primary school - I did not understand the theme. I needed the column to get what was going on, and I didn't find it particularly interesting for personal reasons. I can't play any music any more. Not that I ever could do it well, anyway. I *sort of* played the flute in school - we all did, as it was the only instrument we were taught how to play (probably because it was the only one simple and cheap enough to be mass produced for millions of ""communist"" children), and very, very badly, too - but I forgot how to quickly. Also, I never really could read music - I only knew what I had to do with that stupid flute to get the corresponding sounds, but that's it - I could not hum or whistle the notes. So yeah, even once I understood it, the theme left me cold, with memories of time wasted in those ridiculous music ""classes"" with an alcoholic misanthrope for a ""teacher"".",19,positive,0.7479299306869507

"Interesting that some/many commenters didn't realize the theme until finishing the puzzle.

For me, a (fairly) rare case where I needed the theme to get the solve. Well, maybe not needed, but it definitely helped.

Any SUMO fans here? Timely answer, as it was just announced that Onosato was promoted to Ozeki after winning the September tournament (his second championship in the past 3 tourneys) and he crushed the previous record for fastest rise to that rank. I expect (and hope) he will be promoted to Yokozuna (highest rank) next year.

What is the story with 1-down anyway?  It seems like a terrible clue / answer pair.  Maybe I'm missing something elegant about it.  I almost complained about the telephone answer until I realized it referred to musical ""numbers"".  OK... I suppose.  Still too much pointing at a readily apparent theme.

I only knew about 50% of the general knowledge questions in this puzzle, and there were a lot of them ‚Äî or so it seemed to me.  Most of it fell in place with steady work.
