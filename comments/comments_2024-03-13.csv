"Another day, another crossword scandal.

This time it seems to be particularly around RARED.  That's go down in infamy with PEG, another recent example.

I had never hear it used that way.  

But the point is that crosswords explore language from many, many different angles.  Some may say it's dialect--but dialect for some is everyday usage for others.  And visa versa.

It should be exciting and humbling to find that there are many nooks and crannies even in a language we think we know very well.

Crosswords challenge you to learn new words and phrases, common here, rare there, and you overcome your blind spots by knowing enough crosses and making enough intelligent guesses to get past them.

And that's why they're fun.",12,neutral,0.4606080651283264

"A good puzzle for the word history lovers. The etymons are as follows:

Both -phore and -phor are from the Greek root that is a cousin of our ‚Äúbear‚Äù (as in carrying, not the animal). Semaphore = bearing meaning; metaphor = carrying across/through.

Ejiofor‚Äôs -ofor is from Igbo, a principal language of Nigeria, where it is a common name element meaning ‚Äúset in the right direction‚Äù: Ejiofor = holding steady on the right course. An English counterpart might well be Steadman.

Before is from old Germanic roots meaning literally ‚Äúby the front‚Äù - in space or (as in the puzzle) in time.

Four is the most strange, as it is clearly derived from the same root as other Proto-Indo-European names for the number 4, yet how it came to start with an ‚Äúf‚Äù sound in Germanic languages (vier, fyre, four) instead of the kw/ch sound of all the rest (quattro, cztery, quatre) remains a mystery.",26,neutral,0.6527828574180603

They aren't too short but lately more and more of my posts don't get posted.

Anyhow, I want to share that I had a moonroof once. It was in a 1981 Oldsmobile Toronado.

There aren't even enough Os in smooth to describe Maude. 

At around 210,000 miles, her transmission gave out. Tragically, it didn't really make sense to repair.

Decades later, I drive a bright orange car named Ollie! She's more zippy than Maude was but I love her equally. The only thing she lacks is a moonroof.... and a cassette player.

31 Down : Variety of Indian tea . The answer according to NYT is CHAI. 
This is wrong. Chai is simply the Hindi word for Tea. When you say Chai Tea , what our Indian ears hear is Tea Tea ! Thus,  Chai is not a variety , just simply a word meaning tea.

"Most of Sappho's works, as you know, exist only in fragments, sometimes no more than a few words, other times hefty chunks, with a few that may well be complete. To the modern mind, which is used to fragmentation and accustomed to works that have no beginnings or resolutions, she is particularly attractive, and a fair few very gifted authors & translators have rendered Sappho for us. Anne Carson, a poet who is a strange & wondrous amalgam of the postmodern and the classical, is a favorite of mine and her Sappho is both ancient and timeless.

FRAGMENT 31

He seems to me equal to the gods that man

whoever he is who opposite you
sits and listens close
to your sweet speaking

and lovely laughing ‚Äì oh it
puts the heart in my chest on wings
for when I look at you, even a moment, no speaking
is left in me

no: tongue breaks and thin
fire is racing under skin
and in eyes no sight and drumming
fills ears

and cold sweat holds me and shaking
grips me all, greener than grass
I am and dead ‚Äì or almost
I seem to me.

But all is to be dared, because even a person of poverty

As if it is an unconscious bias, perhaps on the synaptic, neurological level, I can never get the names right of any of the dozen or more truly talented & well established actors of African origin or with African-sounding names. It's something I'm a little ashamed of, though it's an xword-specific shame. Does anyone else have this blockage? Idris & Lupita, after that I'm cooked. 

Loved the SW theme! Go NM Lobos!",11,positive,0.5517630577087402

"Quick work on this one, although I had to depend on crosses for a couple of themers. The actor was nearly my undoing, as I rarely watch movies, but I had heard of him, but had a difficult time trying to decide if I spelled the name correctly (I did). 

Thanks, Drew, it was (a little) stressful, but still enjoyable.

My last car had a sunroof/moonroof combination. As a sunroof, it slid back into the rear part of the car's roof. As a moonroof, the rear part of the glass raised up, creating a smaller, mostly rear-facing opening. I preferred the moonroof function, as it was quieter when moving, and it did a good job of letting hot air escape when trying to cool down a car that had been parked in a sunny, hot location.",9,neutral,0.5079314708709717

"A couple of brief observations based on the Tuesday comments:

I made a brief comment about how I partially filled in one answer based on the fact that there were multiple spellings for the answer, only to find out the answer was something else entirely.  I then saw that this post was getting recommended at a fast clip, and as it turns out, it wound up being the most recommended post of the day.  Thus I realize I have absolutely NO idea whatsoever why some things I say that I think are as ordinary as can be get recommended so fast, and other things I say, some of which I think are so clever, get two or three reccos, or even sometimes none at all.  The day I announced I passed a streak milestone, I expected a lot of reccos, but yesterday's came out of the blue.

The other thing I noticed in the Tuesday comments is that so many people had a hard time because they didn't recognize the sharp and flat symbols.  In fact, a few of them thought that had to be able to read music to know them.  I don't read music, and I recognized them.  What's going on in the schools these days?  You don't have to be Mozart to recognize sharp and flat symbols, do you?  Put basic music literacy up there with cursive writing and analog clock time-telling.",44,neutral,0.6755772233009338

"Hi, I haven't started Wednesday's puzzle yet but I was browsing around and ran into this old Far Side cartoon! I've always loved the Far Side and this one seemed very timely in light of the today's/Tuesday's puzzle, which was pretty difficult for me partly because I don't actually read music even a little and probably partly because of feeling a little crabby.
