Not for the first time, not on Nathan‚Äôs wavelength. Lots of super obscure (to me but I imagine to others) trivia. The SE was particularly bad on this front. Frankly, I don‚Äôt care about a discontinued Mitsubishi sports sedan and never will, and don‚Äôt have much more time or brain capacity for British sheep breeds, or imaginary currency in a video game, or brands of power tools. 

For me, the sheer dullness and difficulty-for-the-sake-of-difficulty of those entries more than outweighed the clever cluing of the open middle.

To be clear, I‚Äôm not saying the cluing was unfair. Once I had the crosses, I could suss out DORSET and RUPEE for example, and EVO came from the crosses themselves. (And I exempt KATY from my kvetching: while I didn‚Äôt know the book, the clue gave me just enough to go on.)

The problem is that with that kind of trivia I don‚Äôt really care about the answers when I‚Äôm done. It‚Äôs just: okay, I finished the puzzle. Now I can get on with my day. A slog, not a joy.

"I never fail to find it fascinating how different one‚Äôs experiences of these crosswords can be! I sailed through this one, until, like Caitlin, I got stalled in the SE; nevertheless, while not a PB, I finished well below my average time. While yesterday‚Äôs, which most seemed to find a breeze, took quite a bit more time than today‚Äôs, although, surprisingly, it did also come in below my Friday average. That was one of those satisfying solves which at first seemed to me impossible, but which, bit by bit, I managed to bulldog my way through‚Äî only to find others deemed it easy! So imagine my surprise to discover a Saturday I found relatively easy was a stumper for others! Ya never know‚Ä¶.",12,positive,0.8789690136909485

"This was just impossibly hard for me, and not in a personally enjoyable way. I can do a hard puzzle, sometimes, but today the clueing was not on my wavelength, I did not know most of the trivia (proper names, quotes), and some of the non-trivia answers were completely alien to me, too (STUNT DOGS? Is that a thing? Apparently so. But how do you get that from the clue?). My being Polish fairly played a huge part in not knowing most of this stuff (I mean, you may be shocked but I don't really know who Robert Frost was, just as you probably don't know Cyprian Kamil Norwid) so I'm sure the intended audience had it much easier.

Saturdays are supposed to be hard, so I'm OK with my failure (at first I resorted to lookups and autocheck, but then I gave up and revealed the puzzle when I was left with a few crossing mysteries in the middle - so a huge failure it was indeed), but being OK with it does not mean I enjoyed the experience.",40,negative,0.7568269371986389
"A few were very difficult for me to first get, and then understand! Most I got my brain around in the end,  but scratch = DOUGH? 

Very clever clueing and arrangement with the scratching and the itching, the LOLCATS and the STUNTDOGS; I love that some layouts like this give lots to discover beyond the answers!",8,positive,0.4955213665962219

"Lots to love about Natan's latest puzzle.

The grid is a case of ""opposites attract."" Where else would:

LOLCATS cross STUNTDOGS? (Do I hear a SOUNDBITE?)

WEDDINGBANDS cross BREXIT? (IN LOVE or MOVE ALONG? Take your pick.)

And perhaps my favorite ...

BLOODSTREAMS cross RARECOINS (could have been/should have been clued as ""They're out of circulation"")

Truly a missed opportunity.",45,positive,0.8310158252716064
"A sound I started to think I'd never hear.  This one was out of my league and I would never have finished it without four or five searches with the know-it-alls Google and Wikipedia.  I would say I learned a lot, but I knew a lot of the fills, but did not recognize the chosen paths to find them.

Impressive construction, Natan Last, the hardest puzzle I've worked in years. Thanks, and next time I see your name on a puzzle I'll be prepared to suit up for another super challenge.  Bring it on.",17,positive,0.6991389989852905
"Good puzzle, really liked the factual answers like kultur, Leone, Brexit, Allie B. Latimer -- never heard of her but a good crossword always teaches you something. As for Dock Ellis, the LSD no-hitter is just one of the two historic events that will forever enshrine his name in baseball lore. The other one is being the pitcher who gave up Reggie Jackson's mammoth home run in the 1971 All-Star game when Reggie propelled one into the light tower atop Tiger Stadium's right-field roof.",17,positive,0.8552126288414001
"Oof. My slowest Saturday in many weeks. 

The NW was particularly challenging. I quickly dropped in KABUKI and MENTION, but the crosses simply wouldn‚Äôt cooperate, so I took them out (more than once).  Eventually, BALLOONS helped me with KULTUR and ALLIE (about whom I know less than I should), but it was still a struggle to finish that corner.  

Despite having been a devoted ‚ÄúBatman‚Äù fan in my childhood, I only vaguely remember the character Louie the Lilac and for a bit had George BuRns in the role (that was after trying Paul Lynde).

And I couldn‚Äôt make sense of the 23A clue ‚ÄúTalk trashed.‚Äù I kept interpreting it as ‚ÄúTalked trash.‚Äù I‚Äôm not convinced the clue really works; ‚ÄúTalk trash‚Äù seems to better match SLUR grammatically and to me is just as funny. I suppose now that TALKED is meant to be read as ‚Äúspoken,‚Äô‚Äù but that‚Äôs still something of a stretch. 

In the end, though, it was the typos that almost got me: HoGH for the 22D weather datum lead me to SOUND noTE (whatever that is) and the politician‚Äôs promised TAX CiT kept me from seeing SEAN PAUL. 

Thanks for the challenge, Mr. Last, even though I spent much of it feeling OUTCLASSED.",8,negative,0.7215894460678101
"Same as Caitlin, I had big trouble at the very end in the SE corner.  Could not come up with the ending for WEDDING to save my life, because could not get past wanting Vows, which were not long enough.  BREXIT when it finally emerged earned me a self-inflicted head slap.  And somehow I knew DORSET. 
And there must have been something written fairly recently about Dock ELLIS, because somehow I knew that, but have no idea how.

And I join Laura Stratton in thanking Natan for this lively and solvable puzzle.",10,negative,0.6904481649398804
"First go around was meagre - I don't think I had a gimme until the Mazda Protege and that corner surrendered quite quickly but the rest of it remained white space - 'Here be dragons' - for a while.  Eventually I guessed WEDDING rings for 18D and I was more than half right: and I did my usual trick of using the rebus button to insert 'shy' and 'aft' for 19A - you can't fool me, it's one of those - before I had to abandon both very late.  When the puzzle eventually fell, it all went quite quickly for me so I'm happy.",8,neutral,0.579261064529419

"Funny how on some Saturdays I can think laterally throughout most of the puzzle, but not in one section.  That was the NW for me with this puzzle.  Or maybe it was plopping in some wrong answers (pEsci instead of BERLE and Assert rather APPLAUD - darn you ‚ÄúPut‚Äù for fooling me once again into thinking present instead of past tense) and then not being able to get rid of them until I absolutely had to.  Ah well, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not a speed solver.  That and my inability to type, or think, very speedily.

But I‚Äôm proud of myself for taking a break.  And when I came back, just like clockwork  . . . Nothing.  So I took another break, came back, deleted everything up there and started from scratch with my thinking cap readjusted, and this time spelled  KABUKI correctly, which made a big difference because not many first names begin with a ‚ÄúU.‚Äù  Ultimately, it all came together up there. 

TLDR:  True Saturday test for me.  BANG UP job, Natan!",24,negative,0.4744971692562103
