Then again again, even nerdy 18-year-old me probably couldn't quote a political humorist from 20 years earlier! Maybe it was the editors. Either way, great clue and great puzzle",0,neutral,0.5299362540245056

Forgot about it, did my errands, etc and finally went back to it.  My failed attempt , greenbaypackers, finally gave way to THANKSGIVINGDAY and eventually everything fell into place.

Upon reading that the constructor, Jackson, is a high school senior I was bowled over.  Truly amazing feat for someone so young!  Such a great puzzle to boot.

Good luck with your college applications Jackson.  As someone who wrote many a recommendation for my AP  Bio students over a 30  year career, I know how arduous they can be to complete and how torturous the wait is.",9,neutral,0.4458540678024292

C, the speed of light, tends to be Capital C.
WRT the speed of sound there is an excellent reason to NOT use C because the speed of sound is dependent on temperature which is usually in centigrade and therefor C is going to be a temperature measurement in any calculation involving the speed of sound.

Although I know the accepted term is ""Pescatarian,"" the spelling makes me and A. E. Housman wince: why isn't it ""Piscitarian""? Didn't_these_people_take_Latin!?!?

Or as the OED politely puts it (and btw, the cited first usage is only from 1991):
""If the assumption that the word was formed on Italian pesce is correct, the pronunciation with /sk/ (rather than / É/ ) and the spelling pescatarian both suggest that this origin has been opaque to many from an early date.""

Opaque, indeed.

"I posted initial thoughts last night after a very long day. To sum up: very smooth solve, best Friday ever, and very enjoyable puzzle, plus a joke about all my exes living in Texas. 

Looking at the puzzle again in the light of a new day, I appreciate it even more! I love a good theme but for themeless puzzles, I'm totally okay with out a theme when there's such good, fun wordplay/witticisms/misdirection, etc.‚Äîand this one is chock-full of it! 

My favorites:
‚ÄîPig *tales* for PEPPA is so cute!!
‚ÄîNo contact rule for EXES is a fun misdirect, especially right after completing a football entry
‚ÄîA lot to like for PRIME REAL ESTATE is just so clever!
‚ÄîWindy flight for SPIRAL STAIRCASE was the only spanner I struggled with, initially thinking of Chicago as the windy city.
‚ÄîLike you and me for MORTAL‚Äîwonderfully vague and so cute upon discovery!
‚ÄîVault opener for POLE!  So clever and fun!

Those were favorites but the whole SHEBANG was fun and sparkly to me! And it taught me some things I did not know, whether I remember them or not is a whole other matter! Glad I went back over it again to remind myself what a gem it is! If I solve too late at night, especially a themeless, I might enjoy doing it, but don't always remember what made it so special unless I review next day!

It was definitely Friday level, but the grid being open allowed for many crossings, there were a lot of ways into it.

Great clues for PARANOID; MORTAL and SPIRAL STAIRCASE.  Why can't I remember my diets?  If only PESCETARIAN had come in sooner, it would have saved me a lot of struggle.  OTOH, I who remember nothing somehow remembered that it's the SHARPEI that has a blue tongue -- although I did first confirm the answer with IPOS.

INDUCTEE instead of INITIATE and SWALLOWS instead of SPARROWS slowed me down a bit, but didn't do lasting damage.

Good morning for Neoplatonism(!), what with THEISM at the top and DYADS at the bottom. Or, as is conveniently wiki-splained for us:

""The first and highest aspect of God is described by Plato as the One (Œ§·Ω∏ ·ºùŒΩ, 'To Hen'), the source, or the Monad.[8] This is the God above the Demiurge, and manifests through the actions of the Demiurge. The Monad emanated the demiurge or Nous (consciousness) from its ""indeterminate"" vitality due to the monad being so abundant that it overflowed back onto itself, causing self-reflection.[9] This self-reflection of the indeterminate vitality was referred to by Plotinus as the ""Demiurge"" or creator. The second principle is organization in its reflection of the nonsentient force or dynamis, also called the one or the Monad. The DYAD is energeia emanated by the one that is then the work, process or activity called nous, Demiurge, mind, consciousness that organizes the indeterminate vitality into the experience called the material world, universe, cosmos. Plotinus also elucidates the equation of matter with nothing or non-being in The Enneads[10] which more correctly is to express the concept of idealism or that there is not anything or anywhere outside of the ""mind"" or nous (c.f. pantheism).""

The military record involved has been the subject of numerous recent news articles, and I think there was no reason to go there with the puzzle. The thread ultimately got deleted, including many benign observations.  I get it that not every potential source of controversy can be predicted by the editors, but IMHO these two certainly could have been.

Any crossword that features wordplay on the entry SPIRALSTAIRCASE is automatically a good puzzle in my book. It's amazing how many ways that it can be clued in a fun way. Excellent job Jackson!,20,positive,0.980426549911499

"Another great puzzle from Jackson Matz.  I hope college doesn't interfere with future offerings.  Priorities, MAN!

Molly Ivins was one of a kind, and I miss her writing.  It was nice seeing her Elvis obituary.  That triggered this:

"Loved the long spanners, was so pleased when SPIRALSTAIRCASE turned out to be correct.  Still needed help as always with end of week puzzles. 

I was surprised that we had such a young constructor today and hope  Jackson will still find the time to do the crosswords when at college.",13,positive,0.9625394344329834
"My goodness. Always in awe of a constructor‚Äôs skill, I am doubly so when said constructor is still in their teens. MAN, I was shaving my hair and head banging to punk rock at that age. Which probably explains my cognitive decline. 

Another tough puzzle; it‚Äôs been one of those weeks, but a few runs at it got me going. Those long spanner‚Äôs helped. Despite knowing nothing  about American football other than what I‚Äôve gleaned from the grids, I got 1D fairly swiftly with helpful crosses. I wanted ChowChow for SHARPEI but was saved by lack of space. Haven't read the Tin Drum for years but the name emerged from somewhere out the back of my head. That K gave me the in.

There‚Äôs a very old black and white horror film called 30A that scared the bejesus out of me as a teen. Watched it again around 20 years ago. Yep, still gave me the creeps.

Well done Mr Matz. Along with everyone here I applaud you and wish you well on your next stage of education.",14,positive,0.7175675630569458

"I solve the NYT crossword daily, but rarely read the insight column provided, maybe once in a Blue Sunday to see how the columnist and or creator thought of it. This Friday was a doozy: medium hard as Friday goes but very unique and so many possible ways to look at many of the clues and answers. So I had to understand its provenance, expecting a seasoned possibly decades long veteran. Thus was I surprised to read of the creator's age and life status. Very impressive! I hope they keep it up and don't get bogged down with trivialities like attending college. Keep them coming!",37,neutral,0.5326562523841858
"Loved it.

Legitimately challenging with many well written clues. ERICH below HAVOCS was novel, as I‚Äôve not heard HAVOC used as a verb before or pronounced ERICH as ‚ÄúE-RICH‚Äù. However in the spirit of the puzzle, one creates havoc with confusion and obfuscation, so it seemed appropriate.

APES before EXES, INDUCTEE before INITIATE, SAMOYED before SHARPEI, PIPPI before PEPPA, JEER before JAPE.

I see a lot of enthusiasm for the hometown football team - people ask if I am onboard and I usually say the same thing: at some point I realized I could name more football players than US Presidents. Maybe that isn't unique or relevant, it just seems hard to avoid.

Cheers",11,positive,0.7980859279632568
"Got stuck, but had the -ian of the omega 3 clue, so I was trying to think of diet names. Then thinking ü§î of fish, I wondered if pescatarian was a thing and looked it up‚Ä¶ noticed the spelling variant and when it worked, I headed to the finish. Made my evening! Huzzah ü•≥

Nice puzzle. The crosses helped with THORNE, MCATS and SHARPEI but otherwise fair and not too USeteric.",10,neutral,0.6687697172164917
"A reasonable Friday challenge, made more challenging by my inability to remember the correct spellings of PESCETARIAN and VASCO de Gama. 

I enjoyed the quote from my one-time neighbor, Molly Ivins, even though it reminded me how much I miss her writing. 

Thanks for a colorfully clued romp, Mr. Matz! And good luck with the college admissions process.",10,neutral,0.4255078136920929
"Mr. Matz is an impressive student. I predict that his applications for early decision to Northwestern University, University of Michigan and Boston University will be looked upon favorably.
QUES.:Why those three, you ask?
ANS.: Because all three of them have Crossword Clubs!
And, he'll be pre-med; my prediction is based upon his subconscious choice of ""MCAT"" for 39D---a.k.a.. the ""Medical College Admission Test""
Good luck, Jackson!",14,positive,0.937188982963562
"I can often do Friday puzzles quite easily, but not today. Not knowing some of the trivia and apparently not being on the constructor's wavelength were my undoing - I needed several lookups and autocheck to finish in reasonable time. I have had much better results even on many Saturdays, including those decried by man as being too hard. It is really interesting how idiosyncratic solving experiences can be.

I have never seen HAVOCS used as a verb, but I suppose dictionaries allow it? 

ERICH threw me - I speak German so I would never think of pronouncing the name to rhyme with RICH, and that mental leap was needed to get the answer. I wanted ERICa there, for a Spanish connection to riches.

I sighed when I saw the Detroit Lions spanner - just what a foreign solver wants: an uber-long American sport entry ü§£.

For an experienced American solver this must have been an enjoyable puzzle, and not very hard, either. For me it was impossibly difficult in places, but I'm not complaining - you can't win them all as a foreigner.",27,neutral,0.4584461450576782
I was ready to be hostile about HOSTAL being spelled wrong but of course I was spelling PESCETARIAN wrong (and even now my phone‚Äôs spell check also prefers PESCATARIAN).,16,negative,0.8754746317863464
"Strangely, after several difficult days for me, this was my best Friday ever! And a clean solve! Huzzah!!

Loved the spanners! Somehow they just came to me. THANKSGIVING DAY needed no crosses and the others I only had like two or three crosses for before filling them in.

I don't think we ever knew Porky's age but I assume it was much more than four, so for once I didn't have to debate which pig wasn't question, or whether two or four legs are better...  

Also, I'm reading something into 8D, EXES, considering Thursday's puzzle had the scrambled Texas right up in that same corner....  and after all, don't all your exes live in Texas!? All mine do!   üòâ",11,positive,0.926013171672821

"So much for the ‚Äúhardest week of the year.‚Äù I kind of sailed through that one.

That said, I had a long day, and a perfect Friday really hit the spot. Thanks, Jackson Matz.

Also‚Ä¶

My long day involved working with developers on an app I‚Äôm building.

Being on the other side really makes you appreciate how amazingly smooth the NYT Games App works. We tend to gripe when things aren‚Äôt perfect, but (trust me!) we should be thanking more people than just the constructors and editors in these comments. There‚Äôs a hardworking team behind the scenes whose job is to make sure we don‚Äôt notice them. Well, *now I‚Äôm noticing!*

A sincere thank you to the NYT Games App team. You folks are doing a phenomenal job.",48,positive,0.5467058420181274
"Mr. Matz' construction was rife with challenging clues, but solving it was not frustrating, as some recent puzzles have been, and weirdly (with no political connotation), the long fills were easier than a lot of the short ones.  The simplicity of what looked like impossible spans made me smile every time one emerged.  And when it was done?  THANKSGIVING DAY.

Thank you Jackson, for a beautifully made Friday crossword puzzle.  If it's not too late, attach this one to your college applications and you will be sure to get their attention. (Don't forget to include the solve in a separate sealed envelope.)  Please be assured that we will all be sending good karma your way.  When things settle down, you'll know what to do (another construction, please).",23,positive,0.8795905113220215
"SPARROW led me straight to Simon & Garfunkel, ""El Condor Pasa,"" a song I haven't listened to in decades, so I'll start by thanking you, Jackson, for this:

https://youtu.be/i6d3yVq1Xtw?feature=shared

Another thanks goes to you for including the team VASCO (da Gama) in the grid. Well, not really. Flamengo is the way to go! :-) But still, anything from Rio is fine by me, though I can't imagine how most solvers fared with this one except through the crosses. I know that I would have been asea had I not had one foot in Rio.

This was a most enjoyable puzzle and I had a blast with the spanners. 

And so, thank you, Jackson, for this great puzzle, and best wishes for good luck 
with college applications.
I do hope they'll consider the great achievement that it is to already have three puzzles published in the NYT. 
It's really very impressive!",13,positive,0.944530725479126

"Noooo!  After the last few difficult (but fun!) puzzles, I was soooo on the wavelength of this one, surprisingly blitzing through all the long entries with just a few crosses.  Was gonna obliterate my Friday best time, but got stuck on one letter - the H of ERICH and MACH.  Had no idea what a Maca or Mack number could be, or how Erica or Erick could be related to crypto, but convinced myself I must be wrong somewhere else and off I went.

I needed a few more crosses to get PRIMEREALESTATE.  But the highlight of the puzzle for me was the central horizontal spanner, SPIRALSTAIRCASE, for windy flight. The puzzle was reasonably breezy ‚Äî even if this clue was not.

Being a birder helped me get SPARROWS, as did having a PESCETARIAN daughter, and who would have ever guessed that having read The Tin Drum would pay dividends in a crossword puzzle decades later.
