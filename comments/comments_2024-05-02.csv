- Then solved the hint clue in the SE and had the nice aha moment. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I needed to enter the Ts or not so I put them in only on that NE corner just to stop my forward/back buttons from stopping in those squares as I navigated. 
- At some point several minutes after that I left the app for a bit, and when I went back into the puzzle suddenly all the other Ts were all there in bold. Wha-huh? Was it because I solved the hint clue, and left and went back? Weird logic.

Blank tiny little circles or blank gray squares.  Same conceit; same solving process.  Now all I needed was a good reason for leaving them blank. HOLES had been done already.

Was TEA LEAVES a good reason?  Well, it's a very clever reason, but, alas, it's also a great big ""Huh!"" for the solver.  And that's because there's nothing to clue the words that contain the ""T""s.  You need clues that contain them both.

I think this puzzle crosses the line between cleverly expanding game play and some sort of gray area (pun intended) where so many normal conventions have been ignored or contradicted that the experience of completing the puzzle is sacrificed.",10,negative,0.8171854615211487

"It‚Äôs a bummer about the technical solving issues so many had.  I can see why it was difficult to code, and I think a better solution would have been just blank shaded (or circled) squares that had to be left blank or maybe filled with a T. 

Having a T in a square that could be written ‚Äúunder‚Äù was highly problematic.  I think the main problem was that when filling in an answer it was just so easy to accidentally type something in one of the T squares without meaning to, and then it was very difficult afterwards to see what (if anything) was in that square. And if you accidentally had some random letter in one of those squares, the puzzle would not complete, making fly-specking tricky.

Overall I liked the gimmick though maybe not Thursday-worthy as presented, and I agree with others who have suggested clues that would have hinted at both words. The double-answers were all pretty good except for BAtE (at 3d) which I thought was not a common enough word for an unclued answer.",8,negative,0.785834789276123

I thought it was cleverly constructed, finding 12 crossing entries that make different words when you remove all the tees.... wow!

My only complaint would be that having the ""T"" crossings already in the puzzle made it too easy for tricky Thursday... but how diabolical would it have been with no visual hints!

My favorite clue: ""What has a big part in the Ten Commandments"" for RED SEA.

Managing a multi-platform, highly-visible technical delivery system used by a passionate audience is not easy. Making an update for web - ok, the js files are downloaded when the page loads. But it also needs to have a way for it to work in an app, preferably without forcing a download and update. And that takes some doing.

Perhaps I am forgetting the old saw ""If civil engineers built bridges the way software engineers write programs none of us would ever cross a river again.""

I get it. We want it to 'just work'. I'm choosing to roll with the quirkiness and the need for a little help to get to the final state for the joy of a daily challenge to start my day.

"Clever, Clever. Figured out the theme pretty quickly. And it follows my golden rule, all esoteric answers have generally accessible crossings",10,positive,0.9203888177871704
"Like

My brain enjoys the little zap when the Ts make whole new words!

And today I learned that ibex live in the Alps?!  Off to Google and learn more.",15,positive,0.7221758365631104
Enjoyed the theme and the several international clues today. May have been quick but sometimes it's nice to have a Thursday be a little less punishing.,10,positive,0.962765097618103
"Enjoyable enough. I'm going to get nitpicky about going pro. Most athletes are already professionals before they play their first games in MLB, the NBA and the NHL They've already been playing for pay in the minor leagues.",23,neutral,0.5495385527610779
"Okay, first I came through here to say that I kind of liked the puzzle and theme, even though it took me a little bit longer than I would have liked to grok things when I was working with Alanis.

But then I read the Wordplay column, and have thoughts. ;)  
1. If those instructions are so vital, why aren't they included in the Info (i) section of the puzzle itself?
2. Contrary to the instructions, I entered Ts throughout in the Web version (on an Android browser) and it worked well.
3. I know how hard it is to get things working multiplatform, but isn't that also a continued argument against the fancier and more indulgent / showy constructs?  Again, I happened to like this one myself, but many of them are far too much gild for the lily with little to no return on bang for the buck....
4. At least this was one puzzle where understanding the theme really mattered in solving it.
5. I almost think those T squares should have been fixed / unwriteable on every platform.

Anyhow, I enjoyed it, it was pretty modest difficulty, and I hope it doesn't stir up too much vitriol.",49,positive,0.8113032579421997
On an iPhone with the NYT puzzle app you need to add T to the special squares to get a completed puzzle,4,neutral,0.8550795912742615
"Pretty good time for a Thursday, filled in the Tees with Tees on iOS and got the happy tune.  Not sure what the comment above meant about leaving them blank‚Ä¶

Odd gimmick, didn‚Äôt really add much to the solve in my opinion.  The Tees did help eliminate some guesses as the answers had to work both without and with the Tees‚Ä¶",3,positive,0.929382860660553
"Ok, yeah, pretty straightforward for a Thursday. But some really clever words that can drop their tees (oops hope that doesn‚Äôt get censored) especially FItNESStESt, and impressive to make it all work with no  extraneous Ts except in the revealer. So style points for that. No standout clues, really, except I liked ‚Äúlast but not least‚Äù. I expect we will get the usual ‚Äúmy streak got broken because I couldn‚Äôt fill it in‚Äù and it sounds like for Android users that might be fair, looks like a bit of a rigmarole, and if that‚Äôs true it‚Äôs reasonable to question puzzles where the tech can‚Äôt support the gimmick. But for the record I had no problem on the iPhone app.",17,positive,0.7543252110481262
"Stupid. 
First time in a long while I have solved on line. I have no idea how this puzzle will be presented in the paper tomorrow. 
Am I supposed to be delighted to see flashing T‚Äôs 
Nothing to figure out",9,negative,0.9116095900535583
"I did this on Firefox on a Macbook, and just left the pre-filled T squares blank. Worked fine. It helped that most of the clues were not too tricky.",4,positive,0.6808655261993408
"I use the Android app and didn't even have to  touch the T's, despite the note telling me I had to enter a blank rebus (ok, I didn't read the note till I was having a smoke after) and it completed fine.
This was a lot easier than I expected for a Thursday. Cutsey theme, but not Thursday material.",8,positive,0.6966592669487
"I figured out the theme and solved it. I had to read the article to get it to record it as finished. I am on the web, and had to go back and enter all the T's. Not what the article suggested. I enjoy tricky puzzles. I do not enjoy gimmicks, especially when they don't work properly!",26,neutral,0.5932486057281494
"OK - I've finished the puzzle - tried all of your ""platform"" suggestions -  still can't get the completion music, and the clock is still ticking.  Idiotic gimmick.",18,negative,0.8723729252815247
"This puzzle would have been 1000% better if the Ts were just normal blank clues. Then you'd get an aha moment when the un-clued answers would suddenly make sense after you hit the revealer.  Showing ""T"" in the squares tells you something is up and makes it painfully easy to fill in the answers and ignore the ""T""s entirely as if they weren't there. It kills the ""revealer"" entirely as the ""T""s have been pre-revealed.  A fine puzzle undone by this decision.",86,neutral,0.4401894807815552
Loved this. So clever and clean.,26,positive,0.9836787581443787

"Everyone all set for the ""This is not a crossword"" crowd?

For a touch of elegance, the only regular T in the puzzle is in the revealer.
