I also loved the ""non-lead pipes"" clue, although at first I tried to somehow use plumbing without the Pb.

Seizing is more a matter of GRAB than GRASP in these parts.

Both Wordle and now The Crossword have used it, so I guess MANGA is now a thing.  We shall see; it's quite possible that SamE and the Spelling Bee will disagree.  The KOTO, an instrument that has been around considerably longer than cartoons, is NOT ""on the list.""

"Lovely surprises in the box today.  A 72-word grid on a Tuesday, which usually has 76 or 78.  A terrific end-of-the-week clue for SING BACKUP ‚Äì [Use non-lead pipes?].  A double-layered theme, playing on RSVP as well as the ING rhymes.  And something not seen too often: four UTAHs (those block shapes that look like the state) in the grid.

Then there‚Äôs the spark.  Every theme answer is a NYT puzzle debut, giving solvers new clues and answers to tackle. And when the puzzle‚Äôs bones are fresh, the whole puzzle shines.

I was patting myself on the back, because before uncovering the revealer or reading its clue, I not only saw the rhyming start to the theme answers, but the RSVP as well.  That gave me all the elements I needed to guess the revealer, a skill I‚Äôm weak at and trying so hard to improve on.  But I didn‚Äôt get it!  I was looking for something more complicated, I think.  Oh well.  Small steps.  

That didn‚Äôt dull my enjoyment of this puzzle in the least, however.  There was even a most lovely moment where the cross of ARTIST and ROTUND (of ROTUNDAS) immediately drew to mind Fernando Botero.

Here I am working so hard to do Fridays and Saturdays without any helps and today, a Tuesday, which I felt like I conquered many months ago in my nearly year-long journey of puzzling, I could not figure out the cross of OXLIP and THX.

I'm so embarrassed! I mean, obviously not embarrassed enough to not share it with all of you good people out here on the interwebs... But still embarrassed! Of course it was an X!

VING RHAMES was also the answer to a question in a recent Celebrity Who Wants to be a Millionaire episode. Who is the voice in the We have the meats Arby's ads, if you're wondering. 

At the end of the last century, Ving was also in a Stephen Soderbergh movie adaptation of an Elmore Leonard story, Out of Sight, starring George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez. (Her only watchable performance, IMO.) And the movie itself is very watchable.
