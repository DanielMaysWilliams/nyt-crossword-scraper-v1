"A note on Oscar years:

The Oscars held in 2023 for the work of 2022 were neither the 2022 Oscars nor the 2023 Oscars.  They were the ""95th Academy Awards...honoring movies released in 2022"".

https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2023

This tracks with what happens with Super Bowls.  Super Bowl LVIII was held in 2024.  The Roman numeral designation was specifically designed because each Super Bowl settles the championship of the previous year.  Kansas City won that game, and therefore were the 2023 NFL champions.  

That being said, there can still be some ambiguity as to whether a clue such as today's refers to the year the award was given or the year of the movie's release.  Clearly, the Academy sidesteps this issue for the most part.  However, the NYT Crossword staff is extremely consistent in their approach.  Therefore, you have two options:  complain every time such a clue appears, or just accept how they word such clues.

The editors could avoid this controversy by wording the clues differently (Best Actress RECIPIENT in 2023 or Best Actress for her 2022 film).  But they don't...so far.

It seems to me that most of the people getting peeved must be annoyed because they Googled the answer...and looked on the wrong row.

Geez Laweez.  It fit, but I was so sure it had to be wrong that I put off filling it in. So, so little things like that threw me off and left me less confident of the clues. 
Some very clever clues were ""cold call"", ""feat on a beat"", and of course my favorite ""French buns"".  I had Derr... on the cross when I started laughing. It was nice to see katana again after finding it in Strands a few days ago.  Time to shut it down. G'night folks.

"Faced with the choice of giving up or looking up, I chose the latter.  I just couldn't get with it.  Example: for [French buns] I wrote in chignons, and had to give it up when I started getting crosses.  Looking back, only three look-ups, but maaany put-it-ins‚Äîtake-it-outs, until the right word(s) came along. I always heard lambs say mAA, not BAA. (Actually, I never heard a lamb say either one.) I have never seen an Austin Powers movie, nor ""Aquaman"" but some of the other pop clues finally climbed out of the SLUSH and I was done.  Hooray. Now I'M OUTTA HERE.

Thank you, Andy Kravis.  Not a SLAM DUNK CONTEST, but I wasn't HATING it.  To be honest, it was fun.",11,negative,0.45897337794303894
"Yo, you yo-yos, Yeoh won in 2023, not '22 (Jessica Chastain). I want my money back! 

[French buns] for DERRIERE was a high spot, especially since I was trying for BRIOCHES there when it dawned on me. OK, you got me there. It made me ponder the singularity of ""buns"" and that no one refers to sets of buns as a ""bun."" As I pictured bunches of bums in my mind, I was amused that the images I imagined were slightly stout, neutral-gendered manikins dressed in jeans and flannels, as if my mind, usually to be found in the gutter, had suddenly become prudish and chaste. Oh Behave! it was saying to me.

So much about this puzzle is fun. Loved DEADHEAD crossing PROPHECY...one of the Dead's standards for a time was ""Estimated Prophet,"" sung by Bob Weir and evoking one of those crazy California lunatics who believes he's the Chosen One, with the chorus:

California, preaching on the burning shore
California, I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise, I know I'm gonna shine

OR, can it be read as a prophetic parable of the rise of Kamala Harris to presidency? After all, the song begins:

My time coming any day, don't worry 'bout me, no
Been so long I felt this way, but I'm in no hurry, no
Rainbows and down that highway where ocean breezes blow
My time coming, voices saying they tell me where to go

Kamala was just waiting for her time, and now she's gonna be like a kangaroo at a slam dunk contest! And the Dead were onto it!",18,neutral,0.5233449339866638
"I liked this puzzle, for reasons  for which some people will hate it.  Lots of general knowledge and pop culture references.  Enough like BARTLEBY, MOMOA, DEADHEADS were in my wheelhouse and made the puzzle faster than average for me.  As I young lawyer I often wanted to tell partners assigning me particularly mind numbing tasks, ‚ÄúI prefer not to,‚Äù but discretion being valor‚Äôs better part I elected to bite my tongue instead. Iloved the clue French buns for DERRI√àRES. It was interesting to see the Grateful Dead and Radiohead in the same puzzle as they are two of the bands with the most fanatic, dare I say cult-like, fan bases.  

In the realm of weird coincidences, after yesterday‚Äôs discussion of people‚Äôs reactions to the word MOIST, I was in a drug store today and a birthday card caught my eye in passing.  The front contained only the word MOIST.  Inside the card read ‚ÄúNow your day can only get better. Happy Birthday.‚Äù",40,positive,0.8261127471923828

Shouldn‚Äôt ‚ÄúFrench buns‚Äù [plural] be derri√®res [also plural?]. This threw me off and for a while I had ‚Äúchignons‚Äù which fit lengthwise but obviously wasn‚Äôt the right fit.
