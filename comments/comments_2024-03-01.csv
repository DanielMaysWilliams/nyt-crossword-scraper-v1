""The New York Premiere performance of Gary Hustwit's generative documentary, created live in real time.

Visionary musician and artist Brian Eno — known for producing David Bowie, U2, Talking Heads, among many others; pioneering the genre of ambient music; and releasing over 40 solo and collaboration albums — reveals his creative processes in this groundbreaking generative documentary: a film that’s different every time it’s shown.

""Eno"" utilizes a first-of-its-kind generative software system developed by Hustwit and digital artist Brendan Dawes to combine new interviews with Eno’s rich archive of hundreds of hours of never-before-seen footage and unreleased music. Each screening of Eno is unique, presenting different scenes, order, music, and meant to be experienced live. The generative and infinitely iterative quality of ""Eno"" poetically resonates with the artist’s own creative practice, his methods of using technology to compose music, and his endless deep dive into the mercurial essence of creativity.""",5,neutral,0.6510441303253174

"What a great Friday puzzle! I loved all the parallel clues and entries: in addition to the ones Deb mentioned, there was INSTA/KILO, and OBIT/OP-EDS. Am I missing any?

A musician by avocation, if not vocation, I, too, fell for the RAp/pOSEE trap, even though I felt uncomfortable with it. Raps, like most current popular music genres, are predominantly in duple meter (beats in multiples of two), they are usually notated in 4/4, also called ""common time,"" and abbreviated as ""C""*. Also, even though many raps have tuneful hooks or refrains--I recently linked a video of a rap by Eminem, which featured a lovely refrain by Dido--the whole idea of ""rap"" is rhythmic spoken word, not tuneful melody.

And ""(Une) Posée"" seemed a possible, if unlikely modeling term.

But that wasn't the right answer. Here's Thomas Wilson performing a useful task, for the [benefit] of the Chamber Orchestra of the Springs, in a little Expensive Noise in 2/4, by Scott Joplin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgxgqXGjFsg

But not all rags are in 2/4--here's the great jazz pianist, Johnny Guarnieri, adding a beat (or three) in an unconventional take on the Maple Leaf Rag (the video was excerpted from one with a lengthy spoken intro; but who's that guy who edited himself in on the drum kit?): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Di1Flrgq2E&t=39s

"@Deb I totally agree—no need to rush!  But that’s exactly what I did, filling in RAP rather than RAG. I knew that POSEE was wrong, but it sort of seemed right—models pose, right? But I actually know the term Go-see because actors also use that term (and often get “typed out” at those open calls).

"This one tested my resolve again and again, and each time I refused to buckle.  Let me tell you, when that last square filled in, I felt proud and satisfied.  So, as a puzzle itself – before even considering other factors, such as answer and clue quality – this, for me, was top notch.

Those other factors ended up enhancing the experience.  A grid design that elicits a peaceful feeling.  Six NYT debut answers, all longer than eight letters, my favorites being THEM’S THE FACTS and TRY NOT TO LAUGH, both in that center stack, a thing of beauty. Smart cluing, from the lovely [They who shall not be named] for OTHERS, to the simple yet marvelous misdirect [Simple bucket] for layup.  

Not to mention an uber-low 66-word grid whose answer set is smooth as velvet.

Back when I raised barns for a living in Dutch Pennsylvania, you can imagine I toiled with all manner of morose Mordecais and stern Svens, up before the sun, with wooden pegs and not-so-wooden tools. 

And the only thing harder than those men was the job. But the lemonade was top-shelf and the peanut brittle, the perfect pairing and, while I never questioned their faith nor where the lathe fit in, I found the experience lonely, if sweet. 

That’s until I met Lenny. Lenny was a pig.

Part of the job of a barn raiser — and this is never in Want Ad, so pay attention — is some light shepherding. There’s always the livestock what needs to be moved into their new digs from the old. Cows, horses, pigs, sheep — heck, I’ve marshaled llamas, even — from their shabby 2-room with Murphy Bed to the new Graceland. 

Well, Lenny wasn’t having any of it.

I remember it was raining and this particular farm layout had me sloshing across many acres to the old sty. I’ll never forget that sight: the pigs, all in a long row, resolute against the rain, staring at me, motionless, in my sodden approach. Lenny was at the gate. 

I opened it. They didn’t move. Not even the piglets.

“Let’s go!” I said. Nope. I walked behind Lenny and sorta gave him a firm pat. Nothing. A push. He wasn’t moving. I gave it the ol’ heave-ho and, in-turn, got a snort and a faceful of mud.

And the food with the backward food led me to all sorts of dark possibilities like Taco / caT.

I thought this puzzle was incredible. It was filled with all sorts of points of interest and I’m a happier person having solved it. Thanks, Julian Xiao - Well done!",19,positive,0.9018402695655823
"What a beauty this puzzle.  So many great clues it would be hard to list them all—""Takes in the paper"" was one I got right away, but I still thought it was a delightful clue.  ""Simple bucket"" and ""Makes you turn red on a green"" were some other favorites.  

Solving the puzzle was like having a really great dance partner.  Dips and fancy footwork could be surprises, but Julian Xiao's confident leading made me confident I could follow.  It was all in the CUING.

I'm really looking forward to dancing with you again soon, Julian.  Thank you!",21,positive,0.978651225566864
"Just a few seconds slower than my average (not competition ready so holster those sharpies) but not explicitly unapproachable. There were a few nice gimmes like IRKED, STEREO, BALOO,  SCI and ROM to help with some of the more slippery entries - personally I had trouble with the start and the finish. The center, NE and SW corners filled in fairly quickly and were “CRUNCHY”, to borrow an expression.

I did not know NINA RICCI, (I still don’t), or SENORITA but there is a nice little handshake going on without a Joe Hill to stand on, and that’s nice.  I AM READY before I SURE CAN; MASKS before TESTS, LIGIT (sic) before LICIT and I did not know AHOLA was a greeting.

Words matter, man.

Cheers",4,neutral,0.42428484559059143
"Mr. Xiao, it's heart-warming to know this is a special puzzle for you, and so I would like to share with you that it was treated with great care by me.

Without having read Deb's words beforehand, I synchronistically solved the puzzle savoring it, exactly as she suggests.

I walked away from it a few times, keeping in mind  something I always like to think of when engrossed in a challenging solve:
""The answers already exist,"" I say to myself, ""All I have to do is tune in to them.""

TRY NOT TO LAUGH, but this is the thought that quite often breaks open for me what I couldn't see before.

I started out very sure I would need to write an OBIT for my attempt at solving this, yet slowly but surely, it all started getting filled in, until I finally sat and admired the completed grid, ELATEd.

Thank you, Mr. Xiao.
It was a special puzzle for me, too.",28,positive,0.9490602612495422
"Fun and challenging puzzle. Had to flyspeck at the end because I had RAP instead of RAG (POSEE seemed vaguely possible). Finally, I had __CK for canoodle and you can bet my first thought wasn’t NECK.",26,positive,0.8988627791404724
"Whew 😅! I thought this one would take me down! Why did I put russia instead of ALASKA and stubbornly try to make it work?

Hungarians have contributed much to the world’s collective knowledge and to crossword puzzle makers. Between ELO and the inventor of the Rubik’s cube, there’s not a week that they are not mentioned!

Camila and Shawn had more than one collab? Today I learned about SENORITA.  Not sure about their romantic chemistry but they make good pop music together.

Good job 👍🏾 , Julian. I hope you are enjoying college life!",15,positive,0.5469788908958435
"Congratulations, Mr. Xiao, on your solo NYT debut! I found it appropriately challenging for a Friday and especially admire the central stack.

I also enjoyed your constructor note. My own attempts at constructing a themeless puzzle all too often end with a grid that isn’t worth clueing. Thanks for sticking it out with this one.",15,positive,0.9669610857963562
I don't know that I have ever managed to complete a puzzle that seemed so hard without needing to go to the Wordplay column for hints. The puzzle never felt like I could finish it until the very end. That felt like some real perfect sweet spot difficulty for me. Bravo.,18,positive,0.9177979230880737
"I started out thinking that this was going to be a tough one. After entering (incorrectly) maskS, I searched for an entry point through about two-thirds of the puzzle before I found another one. Then I started getting more hits, and more started filling in, until I finally got back to the top and figured out that I should have entered TESTS, and that helped fill in the NW and finish the puzzle.

Really enjoyed (and instantly filled in) 37A; had a lucky guess with BALOO; and liked both sets of duplicate clues. Liked the other long entries as well.

Very nice sophomore effort, and glad you had the perseverance to carry it to completion and acceptance. Thanks, Julian!",10,neutral,0.5253817439079285
"Some puzzle, particularly the golf and basketball clues were misleading and witty, the cluing for opera was also charming, since we were all tempted to enter something a little more bawdy -- I thought of six right off the bat that might be heard in one bordello or another that I refrained from filling in -- and ""takes in the paper"" was nice, old school NYT cluing: the whole puzzle was somehow a throwback, older-than-you'd-think vibe. Wise beyond your years vibe.

And I admire the constructor's notes, the openness and pureness of spirit, to be patient enough to keep working at something until it's ready is a rare trait these days -- and the calm wisdom evident in the words, lots to like about all that.

Unfortunately for my own enjoyment, as soon as I put down speech therapist, I began wondering how Daffy Duck would pronounce that. It didn't take long for Daffy to invade my brain and voice every word in the puzzle. Thenorita. Alathka. Themth the Facths. And tho on. ""Try not to laugh,"" I tell my wife. ""Don't worry,"" she says, ""I'm not going to have to try.""",43,positive,0.7764859199523926
"Great puzzle, Julian!  Challenging and fun. Hope to see more from you!",13,positive,0.9889513850212097
"This was the first Friday puzzle I've tackled (and actually completed) without any hints, and with very minimal googling. I had a blast, and I love seeing that this was the constructor's first puzzle! Great work Julian, I look forward to your next puzzle - no matter how long it takes! :)",36,positive,0.9870581030845642
"Non-actor on a movie set answer isn't accurate - their other name is background actors, actor is right in the name. Non-actors on a movie set are the people behind the camera. Costume, lighting, make-up, assistants, etc. Maybe slightly tweak the clue itself?",4,neutral,0.6458186507225037
"Ah, the “Covid era purchases”. TESTS, sure, but also:
 
Virtual concert tickets
Take-out meals
Sourdough starter
Online therapy sessions
NYT games subscriptions
Books
More books

"One of those puzzles that started slow but things smoothly clicked into places once I got going. Thank you for the enjoyable puzzle!

13A I kept seeing ONION DIP. I did not fill it in because I knew it was the wrong answer but I could not unsee it until late! I need some snack now",19,positive,0.8616000413894653
"I thought the “goofy clue for 37-across” was worth the price of admission all by itself, and was glad to learn it had survived so many iterations and changes. 

Fun and elegant puzzle that absolutely picked up steam as it went. Thank you Julian Xaio and please keep constructing!",24,positive,0.9597040414810181
Thought I was a goner after my first pass — hardly anything filled in. Then it all fell into place pretty quickly! Turns out the constructor and I were on the same wavelength. Very enjoyable puzzle!,28,positive,0.9065517783164978
Congratulations on a solo debut and smooth solve. My woeful ignorance of both hip-hop time-signatures and catwalk jargon (mis)lead me to RAP/POSEE.,34,positive,0.6819940209388733
"Just checking in.  Busy work week.  I’m sure I didn’t miss any controversies.  ;-) 

Really loved this puzzle.  Like Deb, I struggled out of the gate but picked up a lot of steam once I hit the middle of the grid.   
Well done, Julian. Great constructor note as well.",55,positive,0.8968472480773926
"Excuse me Joel Fagliano (author of the mini) but movie EXTRAs are as much actors as any star. Look at any big budget action film and watch the grueling and, thanks to you, thankless acting they do.",5,neutral,0.4908604025840759
