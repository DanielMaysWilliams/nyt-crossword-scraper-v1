"As far as I'm aware, the expression ""cannon fodder"" refers to the targets of cannons, rather than the projectiles with which to load them. ""Fodder"" means ""food,"" so ""cannon fodder"" would refer to that which the cannon eats, so to speak. It's an expression most widely used to refer to soldiers on the front lines whose job it was essentially to absorb cannon fire (read: die) while the rear ranks advanced. In a more oblique sense it's used to refer to something you're willing to sacrifice in order to achieve a larger goal. In the case of a TSHIRT cannon, the shirt is not the target, it's the projectile. No one is eating, no one's dying, nothing's being sacrificed.

"My Dearest Crosswording Compatriots, 

I wish to register a complaint. 114D -- a G.I.'s rations -- is plural. You can see the S at the end for yourself. In English, that means plural. You can therefore imagine my surprise -- nay, shock -- upon learning that the solution (MRE) is not pluralized. 

Oh, and before you respond with some sort of pedantic nitpick (e.g. ""MealS ready to eat, so the plural is unnecessary), you should know that the internet consensuses around MRE being the noun and therefore the plural being MREs. 

And even if I were wrong -- which I am not -- the clue still could have been ""ration"" with no S, and avoided any confusion.

Yes, it is a Boolean operator. Maybe not one YOU use in YOUR favorite coding language, but it is, in fact a Boolean operator. (Please note that although Boolean operators are used in coding, they are not exclusive to coding, and they predated coding by many decades.) 

There is a whole world beyond any one person's narrow experience - and in today's world, there are wonderful search engines where you can double-check what you think you know about. 

And if you check on this, you will find, that NOR is, in fact, a Boolean operator, whether you personally use it or not. Maybe not one of the basic operators, but a derived one, which does not equate to it not being an operator at all...",24,neutral,0.7201471328735352

This puzzle was all of that, plus it incorporated one of the best board games ever invented.

I thoroughly enjoyed today's solve, with only one small hiccup. My knowledge of Spanish is limited to it's relationship with French, so I had to go through several variations before I got the right answer and completed the puzzle. Estes? Estat? Estan? ESTAR it is!",16,positive,0.9564048647880554

"It took me 50 minutes but I managed to solve the puzzle completely unaided, which is rare on a Sunday. Managing to do it all on my own felt great ü§©.

I have only a vague knowledge of Scrabble (it's not a particularly popular game over here, and I have never played it, even though I've intended to give it a go for at least the past twenty years), so I was slow to get the theme, but when I did it really helped me with completing the fill - given how ridiculously inapt I am at deciphering NYT puzzle themes, this was a rare and welcome thing üòÉ.

Also, I truly appreciate how intuitive the sports team name was this time - bless you, HAWAII ISLANDERS üòÉ. 

Among the things I learned today - googling the stuff I got from crosses, after completing the grid - was RADON. I was only vaguely aware of its existence, and I did not know any link between it and house hazards. Apparently Polish construction and building safety law recognizes the issue, and we have legal limits for RADON levels in buildings, but given our construction techniques, the problem rarely materializes in real life - our houses usually have basements with concrete slab floors, or sit on such slabs even if they have no basement, which apparently largely prevents RADON contamination, unlike popular American crawl spaces.",26,positive,0.9587730169296265

"Thank you, Messrs. Anguiano and Stock, for an amusing Sunday puzzle. 

I play too much computer Scrabble, but I didn‚Äôt pick up on the significance of the blue squares at first. For 31A, I had TOO OLD FOR THIS NOW (with the O‚Äôs each in a separate square), and I thought that was a strange way to truncate that lament. (I had skipped IN-APP PURCHASE because I don‚Äôt play video games, but I recognize the phrase from non-gaming apps.)

When I saw the revealer, it all became clear. 

And I too enjoyed seeing KRISTIN SCOTT-THOMAS in the grid. I can only think of three or four things we‚Äôve seen her in, but we‚Äôve always enjoyed her performances. (Nice tie-in to Friday‚Äôs puzzle: She‚Äôs part of the wonderful ensemble cast in Robert Altman‚Äôs ‚ÄúGosford Park.‚Äù)

I was fine after that and finished this monster with no look-ups, a miracle. 

Enrique Henestroza Anguiano and Matthew Stock, you know how to craft a Sunday puzzle and it was a relief to have a  challenge that was worthy our time, full of crafty clues, and one that few are likely to complain about (don't quote me on that).  Thank you!",21,neutral,0.35904109477996826

"A couple of observations on the mechanics of the puzzle.
On both my iPhone and iPad the blue appeared closer to double letter blue than triple letter.  DMITRI, and the realisation that there were triples in the crosses, resolved that.
On the question of rebus vs single letter entries, I feel, having seen both, that the single works better, a more sensible down entry and, hey, the across is tripled by its entry position.
Finally, in Scrabble, premiums only apply when the letter is first entered. So the fact that down entries were only single is completely consistent.",9,neutral,0.8055607676506042

I'm enjoying the Boolean battle royale that Steve from Salt Lake started about NOT vs NOR (I had NOT at first, but not at last), and I can only hope that a tableful of jolly mathematicians sated on burgers and brewskis, joins in the melee. No cosets will be cosseted in that thread, let me tell you!

Well, I scrabbled a bit to finish this one, but not that much; the Scrabble idea was delightful, and as well executed as one could expect; it would be a fever dream to hope for one that functioned the way Scrabble does, with the triple word pointage applicable in BOTH directions. And I bet Enrique and Matthew tried to do that at first and found it impossible to cross triple letter clumps.

The theme was fun to figure out. There was definitely a little thrill going from thinking ‚Äúrhinoi is nonsense, what hole did the constructors pull that out of‚Äù to the eureka moment. 

My only bit of caviling is that I wish it had worked both across and down. I know that would have been much tougher to construct, but I think it would have made it an even more rewarding solve.",7,positive,0.9752470254898071

"SPOILER ALERT: This comment has spoilers about last Sunday's puzzle.


It's getting harder and harder to figure out how to express what the rules are with these tricksy puzzles. Last Sunday, when we had the ""Countdown"" puzzle, we were telling people you couldn't put a number rebus in those squares because the words had to make sense down as well (so TENTDRESS had to be rendered TTDRESS, with TEN hanging down, because if you put a rebus in there, the down answer would read ""TENEN"").

So today, we have a square that reads triple letter across, and single letter down.  So a new solver could ask, why is that allowed?  It's not TEPPPID, after all?

Sigh. I guess the rule is that there IS no tule.",15,negative,0.5990935564041138

"I usually have the xwordinfo.com solution page open as I'm participating in these comments, but I may have to close it soon.
