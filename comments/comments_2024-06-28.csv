"hardest friday in a while

good puzzle!",0,positive,0.5358949899673462
I loved this puzzle and learned quite a few new things which is always a goal of mine. Anyone else have LASPOSADAS instead of NOCHEBUENA? I messed that NW corner up for myself for quite a while‚Ä¶.,1,positive,0.8757447004318237

"Oooh, that NW was killer for me! It would have helped if any of the ALASKA rolls that I've had were salmon-wrapped. I just looked at the menu of every sushi restaurant I go to and none fall into that description‚Äîbut I've also Googled and see that in some places they are described like that. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I had NOCHE BUENA early on but it wasn't enough to help me up there. I have to go out for dinner soon (ironically, sushi) so I ended up giving the roll a lookup and was rolled over by the answer! Oh well! Besides, I should have come up with ALOUD and T SHIRTS sooner, those are absolutely in my wheelhouse!

Nice puzzle! Funny enough, for the tough spots, I kept wanting to enter a rebus to make my wrong answers work! üòÜ It seemed so natural after yesterdays dozens of super fun rebuses!! 

I see yesterday's puzzle is up to 940 comments!! Wow! Go us!!  My work/life schedule rarely allows much comments participation on Thursdays but it did yesterday, so I did my part!! 

Okay, off to sushi... hope there won't be any SPEAKING ROLEs....

I've never heard of BURP cloth and I would never wear a fabric that makes rude sounds.  Or any sounds at all, for that matter.

A note to my high school, Dalton.  You did me a huge disservice by allowing me to take French and Latin.  You should have insisted that I take Spanish. The NYTXW is now all Spanish all the time -- and I am at a huge disadvantage is all I can say.  When was the last time the NYTXW showed the slightest interest in French vocabulary?

What does it say about me that I wanted SCAREY instead of SCENIC for the ridgeline hike?  The only thing that saved me was that that's not how you spell SCARY.

NONA instead of NOrA was very mean (NOT SO NICE) too.  But CAST prevented me from falling into the LIST trap at 1D and I did manage to pull CANT out of my you-know-where.

"Re: [heth]/ETA
The linguist Geoffrey Sampson, in his book *Writing Systems: a Linguistic Introduction* (1990), discusses the development of the Greek alphabet, with its written vowels, from the Semitic consonant-only abjad. In it he hypothesizes a conversation between a Phoenecian trader and his Greek customer, describing this new-fangled think called ""writing"" (The Greek had apparently forgotten all about Linear B). The Phoenecian: ""OK, this mark here stands for 'Aleph . . .no not Aleph, 'Aleph!--can't you hear the difference?""
*Writing Systems* is a fascinating read--at least for language geeks--and is real scholarship, but not so obtuse that an amateur linguist such as myself couldn't follow it.

Ah, the Diaeresis! If you're going to be so pretentious as to pull that one out of hat, you should at least spell it ""di√¶resis"", or perhaps the self-referential ""di√´resis."" I was hoping to find a video clip of a song by some heavy metal band which uses a Tolkien Elvish text as lyrics, but Youtube did not cooperate. Lots of videos about making barrels, however.

"So glad to be back to a normal-sized comments section today.  Wednesday night, I predicted a 1000-comment section, and as of right now, we're only at 914, but those comments are still open, so have at it if you want to get it into quadruple digits!

Anyway, some observations from that marathon session:

Even though they are known for their less-than-stellar track record with electronic solves, it should be obvious to solvers that if the NYT runs rebus puzzles regularly, there's a way to solve it online.  Complaining that there isn't when you just aren't aware of how isn't a good look.  Especially since if you'd just ask, someone would tell you how, as did happen several times.

The fact that the puzzle got you doesn't make it a bad puzzle.  Maybe you're new and weren't expecting that kind of a puzzle, but you might be more prepared next time.  Unfortunately, there's no good way to warn newcomers of rebus or other tricky puzzles in advance without ruining it for the rest of us.  

And maybe you're not new and are just not catching on.  It's still not the fault of the puzzle.  If you don't like rebuses, there are many crossword outlets out there that don't use rebuses.  The USA Today and the Washington Post come to mind.",9,positive,0.9006173014640808
"Yay, Friday! Great puzzle!! I loved the clue for 1D, right off the bat.

I got 10D with only two crosses (I and H). But I felt it was a missed opportunity for some mellifluous late-week-level cluing, even as I was typing it in!

https://youtu.be/zWpMYRWwJp8?si=qZ_hKUZNaIBGgGf6

Love Will Get You There, indeed. Happy Pride, everyone!!

(And isn't that voice such a chip off the famous paternal block??)

Pride is a nice segue into PFLAG. C'mon, y'all: I didn't know this particular organization off the top of my head, either. But it is not a stretch in the least, that a P and FLAG could work in that space. To me, that's the joy of crossword solving -- the extrapolation, that ah-ha moment when the hunch proves correct. WHAT A TREAT!

@Nancy J. said it so well a little down-thread, in part:
Sometimes you just have to relax, work with what you know, and give things time to fall into place.
https://www.nytimes.com/shared/comment/4002mg

Thank you, Enrique. Between the clue for CAB and the Post's PAGE SIX, the smattering of Spanish throughout and centrality of the Pride Flag, this felt like a very NYC puzzle (and right in my wheelhouse!). What a great way to start the day!",9,positive,0.9634482264518738

"Loved this puzzle! (though as usual I told my husband it was ‚Äúirritating‚Äù, ha, as that‚Äôs what I say for every puzzle that doesn‚Äôt immediately fall into place for me‚Ä¶which is most of them ;). It made me think, stumble around to get a foothold, and taught me a couple new things. Bravo!",17,positive,0.8405330181121826
"Pretty easy overall for a Friday, but the upper left killed me for a little while - Spanish and Sushi aren't my things.

(I have nothing nice to say about the not-umlaut clue but it became a non-issue.)",4,negative,0.8641986846923828
Had  trouble with all the Spanish words. Seems like more and more Spanish words in the puzzles recently. Diaereses was getable from the crosses but it just looked weird,2,negative,0.7726361751556396
"I came here for a long time, not a good time. Oof, this was a beast. At least I learned a new word.",4,negative,0.8191620707511902
"I date the beginning of the end at the day in the summer of 1966 when 2nd lieutenant George D. Taylor respnded to an assertion I had uttered by saying, ""Whom told you that?""",33,neutral,0.895581841468811
"I found this one fun.  I had to bounce around a bit because each section had some spots that troubled me, but it fell together nicely.  The final domino to fall was DIAERESES.  I had long forgotten the singular form of the word, and never knew the plural, so all I could think of were umlauts, which clearly didn‚Äôt fit.  In fact, when I plunked the the last letter (the E in SENORES) I fully expected to get the dreaded ‚Äúsomething‚Äôs amiss‚Äù message and was pleased not to.  Although I‚Äôm no punster, when I saw DIAERESES, all I could think of was:  what did the woman with chocolate and peanut allergies do when she ate a peanut butter cup? DIAERESES.",35,positive,0.7056009769439697
"A very orthopedic puzzle! SACRA, ULNA, wow! 
And some handy IBUPROFEN for aches and pains.",23,positive,0.9486873149871826
"An interesting solve--I had all of the top half filled in and very little of the bottom half. Once I figured out how to spell DIAERESES, that helped me break into the rest of the puzzle. And replacing LEGO with KNEX, once I saw HUSK.",12,positive,0.7912399172782898
