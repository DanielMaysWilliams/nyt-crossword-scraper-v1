"Very smooth, Mr. Cardin, very smooth indeed.

Thank you for that and for spreading so much happiness, like Oprah distributing gifts-- ""A PB for you and you and you! PBs for everyone in the audience!"" 

And it's not because it was too easy. It's because it was a  really tight and well-crafted Monday puzzle which gave it the *appearance* of being easy. Kudos!

A shout-out as well to Joel Fagliano for the clue ""Diversion on a long flight.""
So simple, so elegant.

Two choices of diversion and of course I picked the wrong one, laughing at my own thoughts (""...hm, let's see...is it a Boeing 737-9 Max?... can I make Portland fit?..."")

"This went by so fast that I had time for only one sip of coffee and I barely noticed the RODEO themers.  My FIRST RODEO was in Arkansas in 1955 or so, and it was quite interesting.  The calf roping was unforgettable for the one cowboy who had a particularly energetic and uncooperative calf; every time he got hold of the three legs and reached for his piggin string, the calf kicked free and even got back up.  The clock kept ticking.  Finally the cowboy succeeded in the task of tying and threw his hands up to stop the clock, but of course his time was terrible.....so he peevishly gave the calf a little kick.  
I reckon the lesson there was:  no matter how badly you've embarrassed yourself, you can always find a way to make it worse.....so don't.  

Oh, the puzzle.  Obviously, it took me back.  Arkansas is really more Western than Southern in some ways.  Fort Smith was on The Border--cross the river and you were in Indian Territory.  

Nice one, Nate!",5,positive,0.6364256143569946

"My wife and I do the puzzle together every day and often note how our average solve times on the Stats page reflect the much-touted increase in difficulty of each puzzle from Monday to Saturday.  The only exception being Thursdays, which have a greater increase over Wednesday, likely because we sometimes we struggle with the Thursday trick that week (still fun, though!).

So we decided to do some basic analysis of the increase in solve times between each day. For the ~3200 puzzles we've done (love the archives!) and taking out (or ""normalizing"") Thursday, the percentage increase in average solve time is remarkably consistent  about 28% (a bit larger percentage increase from Tu to Wed). 

Even the increase in average solve time from Saturday (hardest) to Sunday (bigger grid, but less difficult) is nearly identical to the other days of the week, Thursday excepted.   

This indicates, over time, how really well the editors and constructors consistently adjust the difficulty level for each day of the week. Pretty amazing.

Here are our numbers, showing the percent increase in average solve time between consecutive days. it would be interesting to see if others' Stats page show similar consistency.

M-Tu: 27.3%
Tu-W: 32.6%
F-Sat: 26.7%
Sat-Sun: 28.2%

And if you look at the Wed-Fri difference in our average solve times (thereby ignoring the inevitable tricky Thursday anomalies) and divide the increased average solve time by 2 days, the percentage increase is exactly 28.0%.",10,neutral,0.6042693853378296

Of course it helped that this was the only RODEO phrase I could think of.  I didn't think it made the perfect revealer, especially-- I wanted something about things you find at a rodeo.  But there's no such phrase.

Trying to guess the revealer gave my brain something to do during this very, very easy solve.  The only other thinking I had to do was guess whether the kealoa would be WHIRLS or TWIRLS.

"I have a friend, let's call him Leo, whose diet of Red Bull soda and poutine has made him into a bit of a pork barrel (although he would correct you and call himself a sow, genders being pretty fluid these days). He has a showdog named Dean from Malta -- but not a Maltese -- that he took to the Westminster show, but Dean proved to be erratic, whirling when he should have swirled, ignoring all of Leo's oral commands, including ""Psst!"" which had always worked in the past, and he finally got loose, having stretched his leash so taut it broke, and peeled off to a cheese store to roll around in feta, then dashed back out again, straight back to the dog show and stood in front of Leo wagging his tail and shaking off the feta, which flew off him in arcs reminiscent of some Tim Duncan jumpers. This incited a riot among the senoras' chihuahuas, and it got pretty hormonal (if they were human you'd have seen some sexts, or is that TMI?) One judge opined that the dog stank and refused to select him for the final round. ""That dog don't hunt,"" he said. It took a visit to a Tea Tree outlet to get their special oil shampoo before Dean was entirely clean. Dean stared up at Leo as if asking, ""What now?"" 

""Those dog people are all bores to panic over something like that. We're getting no respect at all here. Let's get some potato wedges,"" Leo said to Dean. ""Then you can do some CPR on me when I have a heart attack.""

"So POUTINE is now well enough known to appear as a Monday NYT xword answer!  

I emigrated to Québec some 40+ years ago, but I've only eaten poutine once. That was some 15 yrs ago when my coworkers learned that I'd never tried it, and took (herded) me to the greasy spoon  (La Belle Province) across the street from the office in Longueuil. I ate most of it, out of politeness. It was very salty.

I love many iconic Quebec and Montreal specialties, including tourtière, tarte au sucre, smoked meat, and Saint-Viateur bagels. But I will never be able to stomach poutine.
