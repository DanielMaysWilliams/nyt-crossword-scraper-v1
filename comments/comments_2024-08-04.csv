I enjoy the puzzle and always try to get it in less than par. Sometimes I manage to get it in two words and I feel quite clever. Then I was informed that there is ALWAYS a two word solution, which was quite a blow to my ego, lol.

So now my challenge is to get the two word solution each time, and when I'm not successful I check the cheat site so I can learn to play better. Today I managed to get it in two words (T10, T8) and then went to check the cheat site. They had two totally different words! (G9, T5)

SERENE before SEDATE for ""calm"" and ET ALIA before ET ALIA.

Instead I was on the path of A SOLiTary something-or-other.

The theme answers to from the ordinary to the glorious and surprising.  The first three. along with WINTRY MIX, were a bit of a YAWN.  But then came the inspired ISOLATED SPRINKLES, DAMAGING WINDS and my absolute favorite, MORNING FROST.

"I'm so glad the ALOU brothers were one of the answers here, because it gives me the opportunity to geek out on an experience I had exactly 58 years ago, on August 4, 1966. I was 10 years old at the time and it was my first trip to a baseball game ever. If you know me at all, you know I'm a serious baseball fan, and a New York Mets fan specifically, and this game is probably the reason why.

This story will probably need to be told in several parts, so be forewarned.

I often hear that baseball is boring, that football/basketball/hockey/soccer has more action/is more interesting. I think it mostly depends on how you were brought up. For me, baseball was always there, in season, with football for most of the off season.  The other sports were mostly ignored (although my parents got into tennis later). My father was a high school and later, a minor league player, but by the time I was born, he was just a fan. I was born two years before his original team, the Dodgers, left for LA, and he couldn't root for the Yankees, so when the Mets entered the majors in 1962, he rooted for them.

If you know baseball history, you know that expansion teams weren't given much support to field good teams back then, and so the Mets foundered in last or next-to-last place through 1968. If you were a fan, you just rooted for them to win the game you were watching; a championship was out of the question. (The '69 world champion Miracle Mets upended all that.)

Loved ""What dry ice doesn't do"" for MELT. Carbon dioxide sublimates directly from solid to gas, at least at standard atmospheric pressure.

Interestingly, atheists like me, my wife and most of both our families also generally celebrate name days, even though it is a very catholic thing, originally). As a result, personally I found the clue to be technically correct but also inscrutable - even more so as in Poland we don't specifically celebrate St. Patrick's day, so I did not recognize its date.

If you don't like ""subshrub,"" you can use the Greek ""chamaephyte,"" or the Latin ""suffrutex"". I would love it if the ""rut"" in ""suffrutex"" came from ""Ruta,"" the Latin word for rue, but, alas, it's a false friend, deriving instead from ""sub-frutex,"" ""frutex"" being the latin word for, well, shrub.

"After completion, I GAWPed at finding that a switch from TOE LOOk to LOOK solved the error! 

Surprised the hail out of me! 

After GAWPing, I went to Prof Google for its definition, plus I recently signed up for XWord Info, so I now know it's been used 7 times in the modern era, which means I've encountered it once before. It was in the August 4th '23 puzzle, which is when I started doing the crossword. Wow, exactly a year ago! 

Anyhow, fun puzzle! I figured the theme out in lightening fast time, though I, without any crossings or other theme answers in place, entered FROSTed flake at 103A. Ha! It didn't totally make sense but I had Frost from the poem and the reference to breakfast... It didn't stay long but I enjoyed it while it lasted!

I've never dyed or tinted my hair but if I had, I could have called myself a FROSTed flake for that one! 

Finished in good (for me) time and no helps! HUZZAH! There were some little challenging areas, such as putting CAR miLES first and trying to work around it. I still feel good that I got the gist of it even though I had to take out the miLES entirely for a bit before I saw it was SALES. 

I liked having both ROO and RUE in there! I didn't know there was a flower RUE but it had easy crosses for me and it made me think of Rue in Hunger Games. I'll never not get weepy when she dies. 

My favorite was DAMAGING WINDS followed by ISOLATED SPRINKLES!  

Cheers, all! 🍸🍸",14,positive,0.6124362349510193
"Enjoyed being introduced to Arcimboldo and perusing some of his works online. Fascinating and surreal! The GAWP reminded me of Whitman’s barbaric yawp. And I was curious to see what a TOELOOP jump looked like so I watched a tutorial on youtube.  Seems to me one of the most wonderful skills one could have is  to be able to dance on skates! (Maybe in my next life, LOL!) In short, there was a lot in this puzzle to keep me entertained! Thank you!",8,positive,0.974682092666626

"Not the hardest Sunday, got it in about 20 minutes, but a solid 5 of that was trying to problem solve the mistakes. A solid 4 or 5 spots with some weird spelling crossings.

Also GAWP. I've seen it before in the Times but it made me angry those times too.",9,neutral,0.3858768939971924

"Theme clues were way too easy in my opinion.  Overall puzzle pretty light difficulty and not all that much fun.

Sorry.  Maybe I'm just too tired.  I didn't get delight from any of the entries and several seemed like stretches.

Ah well.  Hope everyone is having a good weekend.  :)

"SHOWERS of praise are LIKELY for this clever and fun theme. 

The clue for DAMAGING WINDS blew me away, and I doubt anyone will throw shade at the MOSTLY CLOUDY clue.  

Nicely done, Katie and Scott.  Lots of giggles were sprinkled throughout my solve.",14,positive,0.9772827625274658
"So glad that “wintry mix” was included! That one has always struck me as a hilarious cruel euphemism that is so much more unpleasant in reality than how it sounds.
Of course, right now during “interminable beastly humidity”, a little wintry mix sounds great.

I used this weather pun idea once on a concert poster for our singing group.  The set for the concert was a cappella stuff from assorted early composers, chiefly Monteverdi.
Can you guess it?
