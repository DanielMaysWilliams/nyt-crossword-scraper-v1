"Very enjoyable Monday. Suitably Monday-doable, but with some crunch... some sweetness, but also some al dente cluing and fill. Just right, just past being green and not mushy at all. Thank you Samantha.

Have you ever thought about WHY we like bananas? Sure, they're fun, and tasty, and sweet-but-not-too-sweet, and have a good texture (if you catch one in that 3.5-second time-window when it's just right), but here's Robyn Hitchcock and the Soft Boys' take on specifically why THEY like bananas. In 3 or 4-part harmony!

But really I mostly came here to add my favorite ice cream flavor! A nostalgic nod to my home state: if I (horrors!) have to be limited to just one favorite flavor, it always will be PEPPERMINT STICK. On a sugar cone with jimmies, of course!

My fastest ever Monday solve, at 6:17. I'm amazed that many folks solve these in half that time, since I don't think I ever needed more than a second or two to decide what to type here.  My only mistake was SODA instead of COLA, and fixing that was very quick. That said, my typing is definitely a limiting factor when it comes to speed solving.

Glad to see another new constructor. Looking forward to more from Ms. Nowak.

"No Polish heritage of today's constructor was mentioned in the column or constructor notes. However, Nowak is the most common surname in Poland. It is the equivalent of the English name Newman. ""Nowy"" means ""new"" in Polish, and -ak is a traditional ending of names that derive from everyday words, akin to the better known and more common -ski/-ska (for another example of a name ending with -ak: Marczak is a surname relating to the month of March, marzec in Polish). Interestingly, all Polish common nouns and most proper names are gendered (st√≥≈Ç - table - is a boy, in a way, and szabla - saber - is a girl, while ≈Ç√≥≈ºko - bed - is neutral). The -ak names, like Nowak, are no longer subject to this rule, but they used to be. In the past, Nowak√≥wna was the daughter of a man called Nowak, and his wife was Nowakowa. This tradition was only phased out in the second half of the 20th century.

The second most common surname in Poland is Kowalski/Kowalska (Smith): Kowalski would be a man and Kowalska a woman. Can you imagine how hard it is to introduce gender-neutral language into Polish? Some efforts are being made, and rightly so, but it is much harder than in English.

One of the ways to recognize somebody is American-Polish is by their name, because in English the Polish surnames drop the female gendering (all American Polish names keep the male form - how about that for misogyny?). You would never be called Maria (Mary) Kowalski in Polish - it would always be Maria Kowalska.",25,neutral,0.8622145652770996

"Beautifully executed puzzle, I enjoyed every last bit of it and licked the bowl when no one was watching. 

I read the NPR release on Mr. Shortz's stroke. I was under the impression that he suffered it this weekend and was glad to be disabused of that assumption: he suffered the stroke on Feb. 4 and has been recovering, apparently successfully, over this last month. Strokes must be particularly concerning for a Person of Words since they can affect language use, vocabulary, recall, access & retrieval, etc. From his message he is doing well and hasn't lost any of his superpowers. Thank God! 

All praise to Steve L. for becoming a member of the 3,000 club. That's really amazing, to have done it all without a single lookup. Next up, the Pete Rose club, if I can make an ANALOG to baseball, where 3,000 hits puts one in a very small rarified group of mainly Hall of Famers, with the exception of Charlie Hustle. He had 4256 hits, far and away the most of anybody. That's only 3 1/2 years of puzzling to go, Steve!

Recently saw a CMU Tartans football game where cheerleaders attempted to rouse the crowd by shouting:

Go Bananas! B-A-N-A-N-A-S

"Delightful debut, Ms. Nowak --
a very creative idea, with perfect execution. 
A pleasure to solve and a delicious party to boot, with CAKE, COLA, and BANANA SPLIT.

I remember when I attended one such birthday party for a 10-year-old, back in the 80's.
One of the kids 
asked me the time.
""A quarter to eight,"" I said.
""Huh?""
""Fifteen minutes to eight,"" I translated, and, to cover all the bases, spoke a little louder in case the problem was my tone of voice.
""What?""
And then the light went on for me:
""Seven forty-five.""
""Ah, thank you.""
His mind only registered time as numbers on a digital display, not as the face of a clock! 

But back to the puzzle...
Coincidence or not, I also loved the nod to yesterday's, with 1A being EIGHT. 
A nice continuum.
And a great start to the week.

Thank you, Ms. Nowak!",21,positive,0.9596972465515137

"The fact that this was a Monday puzzle, and a very straightforward one at that (which is to say a perfect one for a newcomer to try his or her luck on), it's a bit anticlimactic to announce the following, but here goes:

This puzzle marks the 3000th consecutive solve in my NYT solving streak.

Every solve has been a clean solve; in other words, there have been no lookups of any sort.  The solve might have been even longer if I hadn't been doing my puzzles on other media when the NYT web interface came out (Puzzazz was an app that worked for the NYT puzzles way back then, and never was unable to handle an oddball theme; Across Lite was my go-to before that), but 3000 puzzles ago was when I started in the NYT interface, and so it's a 3000-day streak today.  (What I'm saying is that I was already doing them without lookups before the streak started, but I don't have documentation for how long.)

I have been solving for over 40 years.  If you can't imagine doing 3000 puzzles in a row without help, keep in mind that these days, with all the resources that exist that didn't when I was starting out, you can become good much faster than when I was new to this.

My solves are rather fast these days because that's my natural pace now.  Solving fast allows me to fit them in every day without fail, even on busy days.  I savor them afterward, among good company here at Wordplay.
