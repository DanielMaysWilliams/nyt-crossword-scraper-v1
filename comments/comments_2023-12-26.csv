"I'm a bit late to the party today and am very late to the Sunday and Monday puzzles, which I only completed on our road trip home today because of holiday festivities galore. 

First, today's puzzle was cute and fun! I enjoyed it and the timely theme! I did not know TLDR offhand but I thought that the crossings were pretty easy to work it out. My one hang up was with NORMA and PADMA... I put PADMe first and missed that it  made NORMe. Easy fix found when I missed the happy music. 

I also loved Monday's theme with the fun jammy songs!

But what I really want to say is that Sunday's puzzle was the first time I felt like I was actually managing and understanding the rebus squares since I started doing these in August. I didn't get it right away but once I did I thought it was very cute and I was very proud of myself for actually accomplishing a rebus puzzle without help! Huzzah!!  I guess that was my present from me to me!",18,positive,0.4509226679801941
"Happy (TOY) BOXing day, Sam C., Neil, all ye merry Wordplayers, and, of course, Neil’s dachshund! And, Neil, may your cruciverbal little friend, EM, BARK ON your future grids for years to come. 

Sam C., while I agree that TOY BOXES must be a “lovely source of post-Christmas cheer” for some, in our house they take a humble second to— paper bags! ‘Tis the day after the Christmas gift-opening frenzy and all the friends and extended family that are currently mobbing the house know to never step on any paper bags in their path, ubiquitous as they may be these days in random rooms and hallways. And to always watch their step: Said bags have a habit of suddenly scooting away, a fluffy tail sticking out of one end. 

Modern life is busy and many of our houseguests opted for gift bags in lieu of wrapping BOXES this year. Cat treats and toys lying around ignored notwithstanding, Señor Gato says that Santa has been very, very good to him this year.",9,positive,0.9417535662651062

Oh, the puzzle!  
I was SO SMART that I put TOYS in the first grayed box I encountered (square 58) and shortly ""had a case of the dry grins.""  (Do people say that any more?  It's so apt and accurate that it should never be retired.)   42D!

Congrats to our new constructor on his debut.

I don't know what TLDR stands for/means.  I thought I'd have a Natick when it crossed the pest control, but I ran the alphabet and somehow pulled the D of DCON out of my you-know-where.

"Ever wonder what the differences are between a bugle, a (modern) trumpet, and a cornet? Well, both the bugle and the trumpet have tubular (i.e. untapered--except for the final bell) bores, bent into an oval shape, but the trumpet has the addition of pistons which allow the player to lengthen or shorten the length of the bore, which changes the pitch; in the bugle all pitch alteration must be done with the players lips, and limits the notes to those in the harmonic series (and stay away from that seventh partial!) (what ever *that* means)

The cornet is similar to the trumpet, but has a slightly conical bore, which subtly changes the tone quality--some--especially French--composers preferred the sound of the cornet, and some scores actually call for both, capitalizing on that difference in tone quality.

In the the Hornbostel-Sach* system of organological classification--yes, there is such a thing--they are designated  423.121.22, 423.233, and 423.232, respectively.

Which didn't stop Leroy Anderson from writing for trumpets: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkYcKfqFNmM

TLDR, but it did induce me to learn the most salient fact, which is that Norma Kamali designed the iconic red one-piece bathing suit Farrah Fawcett Major wore in that poster from the late 70s, engraved in the minds of many a hormonal lad such that even now we can recall each curve, bump, shadow, tone, and hue, and which was taped up in my brother's bedroom for a while until our dad said something scornful about it which ruined its charm for us, because whenever we looked at it, our father's words, mockingly phrased, would intone themselves silently to us. My brother quietly took it down, rolled it up and stuck it in the far recesses of his closet.
