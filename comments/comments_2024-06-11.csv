Super well-crafted and with a tight theme that made me smile once I cracked it.

The reveal was needed to help decipher LIBERTY (I didn't know the Lee Marvin role) and MARMALADE (of course I know the song but it wasn't so simple to zero in on it from The Beatles' huge catalog.)

"Nice to see one of my favorite poets, Frank O'Hara, in this puzzle. O'Hara's poems mix lyricism with a dotty, mercurial conversationalism which is the hallmark of the New York School. To my knowledge, ""Morning"" is the only one of his poems to mention crosswords, which is weird because his poems often have such a sitting-at-the-kitchen-table-doing-the-Sunday-puzzle-in-pen sort of vibe to them. Anyway, here's ""Morning.""

I've got to tell you
how I love you always
I think of it on grey
mornings with death

in my mouth the tea
is never hot enough
then and the cigarette
dry the maroon robe

chills me I need you
and look out the window
at the noiseless snow

At night on the dock
the buses glow like
clouds and I am lonely
thinking of flutes

I miss you always
when I go to the beach
the sand is wet with
tears that seem mine

although I never weep
and hold you in my
heart with a very real
humor you'd be proud of

the parking lot is
crowded and I stand
rattling my keys the car
is empty as a bicycle

what are you doing now
where did you eat your
lunch and were there
lots of anchovies it

is difficult to think
of you without me in
the sentence you depress
me when you are alone

Last night the stars
were numerous and today
snow is their calling
card I'll not be cordial

there is nothing that
distracts me music is
only a crossword puzzle
do you know how it is

when you are the only
passenger if there is a
place further from me
I beg you do not go",33,positive,0.7539916634559631
"Wonderful fiendish grid! Here's Frank O'Hara's poignant ode to Billie Holday (""Lady Day""):

THE DAY LADY DIED

It is 12:20 in New York a Friday
three days after Bastille day, yes
it is 1959 and I go get a shoeshine
because I will get off the 4:19 in Easthampton   
at 7:15 and then go straight to dinner
and I don‚Äôt know the people who will feed me

I walk up the muggy street beginning to sun   
and have a hamburger and a malted and buy
an ugly NEW WORLD WRITING to see what the poets   
in Ghana are doing these days
                                                        I go on to the bank
and Miss Stillwagon (first name Linda I once heard)   
doesn‚Äôt even look up my balance for once in her life   
and in the GOLDEN GRIFFIN I get a little Verlaine   
for Patsy with drawings by Bonnard although I do   
think of Hesiod, trans. Richmond Lattimore or   
Brendan Behan‚Äôs new play or Le Balcon or Les N√®gres
of Genet, but I don‚Äôt, I stick with Verlaine
after practically going to sleep with quandariness

and for Mike I just stroll into the PARK LANE
Liquor Store and ask for a bottle of Strega and   
then I go back where I came from to 6th Avenue   
and the tobacconist in the Ziegfeld Theatre and   
casually ask for a carton of Gauloises and a carton
of Picayunes, and a NEW YORK POST with her face on it

and I am sweating a lot by now and thinking of
leaning on the john door in the 5 SPOT
while she whispered a song along the keyboard
to Mal Waldron and everyone and I stopped breathing",21,neutral,0.5754478573799133

"I enjoyed the theme of this puzzle. I also appreciated the reference to The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, one of my favorite 60‚Äôs westerns, with excellent performances from John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart and Lee Marvin.  The movie has the theme of many 60s westerns of the transition from the Wild West to the modern world.  I learned the word myrmidon from the movie. There‚Äôs also a  song of the same name by the Royal Guardsmen, of Snoopy and the Red Baron fame.",13,positive,0.9754739999771118
