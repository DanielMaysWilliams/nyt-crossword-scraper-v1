"Really enjoyed the grid for this! Lots of neat crosses.

Got caught at the very end with the cross of 31D and 35A.

I've finally gotten to the point that I can usually do a Friday and Saturday without too much problem, sometimes a second pass because I didn't get the happy music the first time.

"What a treat that my last Saturday of the year was my best Saturday time ever! It was a full 33 minutes less than my average! Remarkable!  I confess to one lookup, which was the Yankee's sportsball player, which I had absolutely no hope of knowing and I was really stuck in that section at that point, having only ATARI. 

Favorite clues are 1) Strips in a club - BACON! Got to love a little sass!! And I think a week or two ago we all thought ""Brown in strips"" was going to be bacon, so perhaps we all manifested it.  Yum! And 2) A twist might thicken it - Plot  (Sorry if I slightly mistyped the clue, it's hard to reference back to the puzzle from my phone.)

Amazed that I somehow remembered EFREM Zimbalist and MEESE!  Not so with Jason Momoa's character from Game of Thrones, having never watched or read any of it, But it worked itself out as so many an unknown to me item do.

 I had half or more the squares filled in when I didn‚Äôt think I could finish it without help. Then I just started entering letters that might work and trusted my intuition and blew my socks away completing the Saturday puzzle in 23 minutes?!?!!! I realized I‚Äôm allowing my mind more free rein, trusting my intuition and instincts makes the solve a more flowing and enjoyable ride.

I put puzzle in quotes because you should be able to solve or ""puzzle"" it out if you don't know all the clues, but in this case it was impossible. Far too many proper nouns, and the 1 block on the edges prevented getting many of the answers on crosses. I had to resort to many lookups, and only bothered finishing to keep my streak intact.

"Cute theme, but I am a firm believer in Saturday themeless puzzles. I would have enjoyed this more if it appeared on a Thursday instead. I also thought a lot of the fill was quite obscure, even for a Saturday. Saturdays should be hard by making me think (I love a good ""aha!"" moment) rather than fill that I just don't know: way too many names crossing with other names...

Needless to say I did not finish the NW corner.

Other than that, finishable, but odd.  Even I, visually oblivious as I tend to be, couldn't help noticing that something seemed Very, Very Wrong about the grid.  When you've been looking at crossword grids for all those decades and then you see one that Doesn't Fit At All, you tend to wonder why.

Oh, I see.  Unchecked squares.  This breaks all the rules of puzzledom, so the explanation better be good.

I didn't think it was all that good.  Did you?

The one bonus is that for some reason I can't explain, the grid design tends to make the 15-letter answers look unusually long.  I suppose someone who dabbles in Optics and Optical Art could explain it.",3,negative,0.6086742281913757

"This one was really fun once I finally got a toehold and read the revealer clue.  By that time I had the circles as c o _ f e and it fairly obviously was not going to be coffee something for the circles.  Then a light suddenly dawned as I thought about the holiday which led me to insert a n in the space and then provisionally the t t i in the rest of the circles and the outer edges came together.  I try not to look up clues but being probably the only person in the world who watched exactly none of Game of Thrones and avoided even reading about it, I allowed myself a lookup on 61 A which became also the aha moment for 6 D.

"Fascinating puzzle. Not at all an easy one for me (hi suejean), but managed to work it all out. Finally catching on to the CONFETTI when I was almost done was a nice 'aha' moment. 

Side note inspired by 1d: When I was younger, I commonly went by a different nickname for Richard, and with my quite common surname, DJ was another nickname often used by my friends in high school. And... I actually was a DJ on a local radio station for a while. And my hometown was in... DICKinson county.

Answer history search today inspired by 6d. Wondered about OVERHILLOVERDALE; Nope - never been in a puzzle and not even in the Xword Info word lists. Even just OVERDALE is not in those lists. The same is true for DUSTYTRAIL and even CAISSONS has only appeared once (in a variety puzzle). 

I'll shut up now, and go rolling along.

But my favorite was ‚ÄúStrips in a club‚Äù which had my mind going in the obvious direction.

This grid was so distinctive that even I noticed it. Usually I am oblivious until I read a mention of it in the Wordplay column. Then I go back and look and am impressed. 

I put the first few singleton letters together as COIN, thinking it would lead to COIN TOSS, referencing all the football this weekend. Wrong! I was very surprised and confused when I finished the puzzle and all the random colors appeared. I finally read the single letters clockwise instead of top to bottom, and all was revealed unto me.

"I'd never explicitly realized that there was an  ""unchecked square"" rule, as alluded to in today's Wordplay column.

And, as noted below by @Barry Ancona, in some sense, the squares comprising CONFETTI aren't really ""unchecked"", since they conspire to create the word confetti, hence they ""cross"", albeit in an unconventional manner.

This was a very interesting and unusual puzzle.

I failed to notice that each black square was isolated and I don't think that, per se, would have impressed me (though this, apparently, is something quite unusual for a crossword).

However, the graphic, displayed upon completion of the puzzle for solvers working on a computer, transformed each black square into a bit of confetti. The isolated black squares then became an integral part of the puzzle theme. That extra flourish gave the puzzle a coherence which I could not fail to admire.

Though this is a Thursday-style puzzle, since Thursdays/Sundays are typically my favorites, I don't mind at all that this appeared on a Saturday.

What a remarkable contribution to (b)ring in the New Year! 

Thank you Simeon Seigel.",34,neutral,0.803138256072998

"What a great design, loved how the black squares all turned colors on completion! And how 1A and 1D are a perfect match: I can also imagine a DJ's gear includes Dr Dre headphones. Next, Ted vs. Ned threw me and added minutes to my time, but it was totally licit. I TINA / IRENA is a lovely pair. Interesting that the N-S fill had a lot of athletic & robust fill, and E-W is the opposite: aging, ill health, exhaustion:

N-S --  Endurance Runner, Over Hill and Dale, Races, Toned, Epees, Pele, perhaps Four Aces

E-W -- Medicine Dropper, Rehab, Using, Went, Ole, Under, Veil, Junker, perhaps Once in a Lifetime*

I'm feeling more E-W than N-S these days. You might say I am over the hill and dale. 

As Simeon mentioned, between him & the editors, good New Year's vibes: Party, XII, even the mention of Wall Street (the ticker-tape parade tradition, cousin of New Year's confetti, began in 1886 when Wall Street workers threw ticker-tape out of their office windows to celebrate the unVEILing of the Statue of Liberty).

If you cross Vince Lombardi with Guy Lombardo, what will he say?
