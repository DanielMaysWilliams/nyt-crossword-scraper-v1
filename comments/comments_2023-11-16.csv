Deb ... I wish I knew more about Cape Town now that you've mentioned it.  I am totally curioius about your reasons!  Need to disappear down a rabbit hole, but need help!
Thanks!",2,positive,0.4338163435459137
"Delightful as always from Paolo Pasco. Although centering autopsy above living on the edge was…edgy.

Pretoria and Cape Town are both 8s, go figure. At least Bloemfontein was out. Cape Town is a wonderful place to visit.",35,positive,0.9134513139724731
"I enjoyed the puzzle, Paulo.  I thought the traditional reBUS at the bottom was a kind clue/hint, since I didn’t know “mea” and was unsure if the state capital was a U.S. state capital until “syllabus” and “rebus” sealed the deal. The only specific thing I could remember Knievel *trying* to jump was the Snake River.

Also, Deb, pass on kudos to the graphics programmers!  That was a nice little reward at the end.",75,positive,0.8576530814170837
