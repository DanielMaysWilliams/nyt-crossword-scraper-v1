"This was a fun puzzle.  My quibble is with the rebus ‚Äúinterpreter‚Äù in the app.  

The NYT crossword instructions explain that when a rebus requires different entries reading across and down, a slash is used to separate the two - ACROSS/DOWN.  Because of this I entered ‚Äú/HOLE‚Äù for each the the rebus spots in this puzzle; that‚Äôs nothing in the across direction and HOLE in the down direction.  

This solution was deemed incorrect.  I checked my answers and then changed all rebus cells to ‚ÄúHOLE‚Äù which completed the puzzle.

"1) Thursday is probably my favorite day, and I really liked this puzzle. That said...

2) @MP Rogers gave a shout-out to the ""unsung heroes, the programmers"". I infer that he was referring to the first-ever extremely elegant programming that allowed one, for the first time, to leave a square blank and still get a successful solve. However...

3) unfortunately that elegance did not extend across all platforms. As we say, YMMV. Isn't it ironic. Today struck me as a swing-and-a-miss in techland. 

I solved on my phone (unusual, as i usually solve on my chromebook). I had no issues; I entered ""HOLE"", didn't get the happy music, flyspecked, found a typo, fixed it, and suddenly Ford's in his flivver and I hear the happy music. ""HOLE"" shows up in all appropriate squares in the solved puzzle graphic. But then I read about all the folks who are looking at ""empty"" squares--i.e. ""holes"". So when I get home I look on my chromebook and yes, it doesn't say ""HOLE"", it says... well, nothing. They're all blank.

The fact that so many people had trouble is... troubling? In the past entering the first letter of a rebus has always been acceptable. Why not today, and on which platforms?  There will always be folks flummoxed by their first rebus, but this was different. 

FYI Sam has already said this elsewhere, but for those of you who lost a streak do not despair. email them and ask for your streak back. Your wish will be granted, and with good reason.

"I solved the puzzle without realizing it and came here to figure what the trick was.

I had initially been putting Os in the holes because I was reading ""Wow"" as the phonetic hint and thinking, akin to 15 DOWN, ""OOO"" might be what he was going for, or like the way people elongate vowel sounds when they're registering surprise (remembering from childhood studio audiences reacting to the unguessed answers on ""Family Feud,"" which I know is still a thing because STEVE HARVEY was a recent answer. I remember when it was the guy from that war show I never watched.)

At some point I realized that couldn't be it so I went through and deleted all my superfluous Os.

When I finally solved ""Warm-up leader at a race"" near the end of my puzzling, I realized what ""Low-tech security measures on some doors"" was, which, well this page quickly gives away the HOLES, but all of a sudden the music played and I still had no idea what had just happened.

I was still grappling with how ""Wow"" was a phonetic hint to the puzzle, completely missing the phonetic hint was ""HOLY.""
