Yes, it's the typography that has me wondering?

Maybe an editor misunderstood Sam's sentence (""repetition ... throughout the grid's themed entries"") to refer to the fact that the themed entries all start with ME and therefore highlighted only the leading letters?

For greater clarity, I might have edited it to read ""repetition of the letters M-E in each of the grid's themed entries.""
