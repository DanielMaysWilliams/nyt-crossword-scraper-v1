An aside:  one year we had a particularly wet, chilly summer.  When DHubby and I trekked to upstate New York, passing the extensive vineyards along Lake Erie, we were shocked  to see the bounteous crop of CONCORD GRAPEs still on the vines.  Welch's had deemed their sugar content too low for their juice products, and cancelled the harvest. Tragic, really.

It's a potent tool for propagandists, as we learn every day...

"I'm not buying the complaints of the ""it could be ACE/ATTAR or ice/ittar"" crowd. Just consider what you'd be saying if you had ACE/ATTAR and the given solution were ice/ittar.

First. consider ATTAR vs. ittar. ATTAR is the normal English word for it; see this Ngram comparing the two:

http://tinyurl.com/2s4yr4tb

Note that ATTAR completely dominates ittar, by about 30-1.  Ittar hardly even registers.  

It also out-Googles ittar by about 40,000,000 to 1,000,000; most of the first few pages of ittar show foreign sources or actually use ATTAR.  When you Google ""ittar definition -attar"", your hits go down to a few thousand.

So yes, it's a thing, but it's not common enough to expect to see it in a crossword.

Now, let's look at ACE/ice.  ACE fits the definition perfectly, because an ACE in tennis is a delivery (serve) that cannot be returned. You just have to know a little about tennis to get this.  

Ice, on the other hand, is rarely delivered anymore, but if it is, and it's still frozen and packaged (I assume bagged ice these days), I don't see why it couldn't be returned. To chose ""ice"" as your answer is a stretch, one you would only make if you didn't see another alternative.  

In the case of both words, a much better alternative was there. New solvers should commit both to memory, because they'll come up again frequently. ATTAR 313 times; ittar none. ACE, at 968 times, is clued via tennis about once or twice a year; ice has never been clued by ""delivery"".",19,neutral,0.6651647090911865

"After seeing Sid's name, I came into this puzzle with a burst of happiness, because there‚Äôs a bubbly element to his puzzles, always, something in them makes me, for the moment, very glad to be alive.  

I also had a scintilla of ‚ÄúBetter bear down‚Äù, because he can be Sid Vicious, purveyer of brilliant but thorny cluing that sets the table for a serious solving effort ‚Ä¶ that always turns out to be worth it.

But Sid has range, and today the fill-in was breezy, and the experience more like tubing down the river rather than running the rapids.  What a lovely conceit, having to sound out in my head synonyms for gossip, thus hearing them, as they intersect with the tumbling grapevine.  Simple and sweet ‚Äì more Sid bubbliness.

I liked the O-clump in the southeast, highlighted by OOO, not to mention the eight double-O‚Äôs in the grid, recalling Friday‚Äôs double-O fest.  I liked seeing the abutting Greek letters ETA and DELTAs, as well as the English letters TEE and BEEs.  

And once again, I savored the air of Sid-fervescence that surrounded me as I solved, and stayed with me even afterward.  Thank you so much for this, sir!",34,positive,0.9706310629844666

Now, you could say that ONE DOLLAR is explicitly saying how many cents it is, and we could quibble over the meaning of ""explicitly"". But the pedantic part is that when the US monetary system was established, it was a decimal system, with five units each separated by a power of ten: cent, dime, dollar, eagle, union.

Westerner (BC, California, Utah, Arizona) all my life, and TOCK and talk are homonyms to me. It's interesting to see all the people who pronounce them differently. There was another puzzle a while back that gave me trouble because it rhymed words that didn't rhyme in my ears. It was using an east coast pronunciation, if I remember correctly.
