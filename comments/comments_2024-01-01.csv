"I have a monthly calendar reminder on the 1st to check out the bonus puzzle. I rarely solve in the app, and I was surprised recently to learn that the bonus puzzle is apparently only available through the website. 

https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/bonus/2024/01

In the past they have usually been roughly Mon-Tues level of difficulty. Today's is by Sam Ezersky; it's titled ""2023 in Review"" and it seems far harder than last year's bonus puzzles. There were several proper nouns with which I was unfamiliar, and thus I was well and truly Naticked. Wondering if anyone else out there solves the bonuses? It's always struck me as odd that they are never discussed here.

Happy New Year to all, and congrats to Mr. Zheng on his debut.",4,neutral,0.7080760598182678

"This was a nice Monday that, despite the kids' game, had fairly grown-up fill with no crosswordese and no names.  

Still, even a good Monday makes me try to make the puzzle more interesting for myself.  Solving ""Downs only"" is not my thing, but once I had the first two themers, I ran the alphabet for a first letter that would enable me to figure out the third ?CK-?CK answer.  I couldn't come up with one.

That's because someone moved the goal posts and the third themer is not a ?CK-?CK answer.  It's a ??P-??P answer.

So much for trying to make the puzzle more interesting for myself.  I wasted some minutes, but since I don't time myself and I'm never in any rush, it didn't matter.

A thought on THERE, THERE NOW.  A male friend of mine once told me  about a scare that took place on a plane when he was traveling with his wife -- not a relaxed flyer under the best of circumstances.  He said he could do little at the time but stroke her hand and say ""there, there.""  And I'm thinking (though I wasn't rude enough to say so)--

I don't want someone cooing ""there, there"" to me.  What earthly good is that?  I want someone providing me with a dozen convincing reasons why the bleeping plane can't possibly go down.",5,positive,0.7458053231239319

"Sam, I'm wishing you, Deb, and Caitlyn a happy, healthy, and contented year. 

I started doing the New York Times Crossword early in 2023, after getting hooked on the Spelling Bee. I read all of the helpful columns about how to play the NYT crossword, and always read Wordplay, even the times when I've solved the puzzle first. I understood rebuses right away, though it took me awhile at times to figure out how the particular ones worked. Besides the dailies, I've worked the archives, too. So far, I've completed 1,042 crosswords with a 99.4% solve rate.

Although the timer runs, that hasn't been my personal measure of success. That would be how often I have to look something up. The fewer times I have to consult iMDB, Google, or Wordplay, I know I'm getting better. 

The hardest thing for a long time was themes. I had the hardest time grasping just what a theme was, and how they worked. I would complete a puzzle and still not know the theme. I'm getting a lot better at identifying themes, often early in the puzzle. And I've found that sometimes I have all of the theme entries done, and the blank spaces in the grid are simple, short words.

All of this is to say ""Thank you"" to all of you for your Wordplay columns, and to the Games crew, especially Deb Amlen, for the wonderful, helpful columns on how to negotiate the Times Crossword. I'm still working my way through the ""Ten ____s You Should Know"" columns as I find them.

"Fun puzzle and my best time ever by about 19 minutes! I call that a good start to the new year!! HUZZAH!! (Sorry for the all caps, it's not a puzzle answer but it sort of requires caps. Hey, has it ever been a puzzle answer?)

My favorite was the crossing of HULA and HULU, especially because I accidentally put HULu for the dance clue and didn't realize it until I got to a Netflix competitor clue. Guess I think about Hulu more than I do about hula. Speaking of, I also enjoyed seeing Meryl Streep. She, as always, was absolutely fantastic in Only Murders in the Building season 3, a fabulous Hulu show.

My least favorite was BOARDWALK only because it brings back such a terrible memories of the near loss of lifelong friendships. That game is the ultimate test of a relationship's strength! The only thing worse was only time my husband and I played checkers. He's s a good, honest, and exceedingly lovely human but we play by entirely different rules when it comes to checkers. My rule is that you follow the rules and don't cheat. His rule seems to be that anything goes. We'd only been married a few years at that point and, honestly, it's a wonder we've made it here to nearly 19 married years after that night. I credit getting rid of the game immediately.

"Sometime after I completed this puzzle, I was fussing around in the kitchen and started saying ""Bye bye plane"" over and over to myself and eventually out loud, in a childish sing-songy way. Both my wife and my dog barked at me to ""pipe down in there!"" and I complied. Turns out that it was July 12, 2007 when a woman with a toddler boarded a plane. The toddler said ""bye bye plane"" over and over, even as the plane was taxiing to the runway. A flight attendant came over and demanded that the mother make her child stop saying ""bye bye plane"" and the conversation grew heated. The woman and her toddler were eventually kicked off the plane. Bye bye plane! Bye bye plane...

My sister read me the story back then and once in a while just for the heck of it, one of us might break out into a bye bye plane rhapsody: it was a surefire way of annoying everyone except Those in the Know. After a while (and it took longer than it should have: I'm not proud) we stopped saying it. But here I am again, murmuring it to myself...
