Therefore the remaining numbers had to be a multiple of 4 (eventually solves to PAC 12) and a multiple of 7 (eventually solves to 21 GUN SALUTE). I couldn’t remember the exact number of shots fired, but I knew it wasn’t 7 or 14 or 28 or 35, so 21 was suddenly rounded up from “one of the possible answers” to “the only possible answer.” It’s a fun dynamic!

Ladies and gentlemen, uh, we've just lost the picture, but what we've seen speaks for itself. 

The Corvair spacecraft has apparently been taken over, 'conquered' if you will, by a master race of giant space ants. 

It's difficult to tell from this vantage point whether they will consume the captive Earthmen or merely enslave them. One thing is for certain: there is no stopping them; the ants will soon be here.

"Nice puzzle! I like to solve with overlays off, and not looking at the title or any notes until I’m done (or if I get stuck) - as an extra challenge. With this puzzle, I filled in the whole thing except for the shaded squares. I could figure out all the numbers that went with the answers, but not how they went in the squares - until I finally turned on overlays and saw the multiplication symbols. Then it finally became clear 🤓. 

However, after putting in all the appropriate digits, I got the dreaded notification that I had something wrong.  It took me a loooong time to find it. Instead of “yes mom” I had “yes, not”. ISt worked well for 127 down, and I’d never heard of Ned ROREM, so ROREn seemed reasonable. And having multiple squares wrong is always much more difficult than just one, especially when one is uncertain if something special might be required for the theme squares.

I got it eventually but I was flyspecking for at least 20 minutes.",4,positive,0.6538508534431458

"Personally I enjoyed this one! Fun clues, a few I was entirely stumped by and had to play around with some crosses to nail down. Very satisfying aha moment. I hadn’t read any puzzle info and figured out the need for numerical answers about halfway through. Different and doable. I like when I have to think outside the standard crossword-solving “box”. Maybe not every day, but sometimes anyway :)",7,positive,0.9435728788375854

"I was told there’d be no math!  Took me longer than it should have to figure the multiplication aspect, so the numeric squares had me puzzled trying to make them work in both directions.  Eventually though, thanks to the revealer, the tidy, clever solution hit me.  Why the multiplication signs in the squares didn’t tip me off I don’t know, but I’ll chalk it up to the lateness of the hour. A nice change of pace.

For the table in the high school cafeteria I first tried jerks, and thought it was the best clue ever.  Of course it turned out to be JOCKS, which made perfect sense and was less snarky.",21,neutral,0.4163483679294586

"Loved today's puzzle; apparently, I'm a word (and maths) nerd - who knew! 

Took me a while to figure out why the numbers wouldn't fit so left them all blank until I got to 131A. Then it all made sense. Definitely prefer it to my archenemy - the dreaded rebus square. More, please! 😀",10,positive,0.9520847201347351
"This one was, for me, an average ruiner.  Not because of the puzzle per se, but rather the circumstances surrounding my solve. There was a lot of commotion and drama going on in the house while I was trying to solve. As a result, I didn’t see exactly what needed to be done with the numbers until everything else was finished. 

One problem for me was that in addition to the numbers, there were some, shall we say, Naticky crosses, at least for me, though the issue wasn’t two proper names. One was ARI and SAMBAR; another was JK SIMMONS and AWAKE (AWARE was possible, too,)

Although this was strictly because of my own knowledge gaps, it was odd because it happened not once but twice in the same puzzle. I don’t remember the last time that happened to me. 

But as always, I stuck with it long enough to get everything working at the same time, and all was good.",25,negative,0.48674967885017395

"Why does the Puzzle Info section say ""Each square in the shaded square is to be filled with a numerical digit""?

Not only does it directly tell you that these answers include numbers, but it holds your hand by telling you the correct character set just in case you might try alpha chars first...

 Please - let the solver figure that out along the way!

I understand that the NYT team wants to make these more accessible to a wider audience, but literally having the theme spoiled in the puzzle info is going too far. The time for a DAILY two-tiered difficulty system is long overdue. An admittedly average player like myself shouldn't be consistently finishing Saturdays and Sundays in less than 30 minutes.

I don't think I'm the only person who gets relaxation and enjoyment from getting unstuck finally having that AHA theme-busting moment. There are also those users who appreciate the timed challenge aspect more. Let's have separate puzzles tailored for each group every day!
