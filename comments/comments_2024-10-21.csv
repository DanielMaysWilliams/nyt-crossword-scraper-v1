"It was very interesting to see the posts about American grade school craft materials. On my side of the pond, I was always bemused by the use of, or should I say recycling of, the humble toilet paper roll in virtually all of my children‚Äôs school craft projects. I once possessed a complete set of TP rolls disguised as anything from Easter Rabbits to Santa Clauses and many things in between. All brightly festooned with their fair share of dry macaroni and finger paint and usually glued to a paper plate (Pritt, no Elmer‚Äôs).
This always put me in mind of what Freud had to say about the origin of the creative impulse.

Where was I. Oh yeah - nice Monday puzzle. Just a bit on the slow side but really enjoyed catching on to the theme when I was done. 

Puzzle find today was inspired in a roundabout way by MACARONI. Anyway... a Sunday puzzle from July 2, 1995 by Alex K. Justin with the title ""Happy Birthday, America!"" One short down answer that referred to other answers was: COHAN. And then there were three 21 letter answers.

"Two later-in-the-week clues on a Monday, rare and wonderful to see:
‚Ä¢ [European ___ (Anguilla Anguilla)] for EEL.  This teaches newer solvers that the un-gettable is gettable, because EEL‚Äôs crosses are Monday-easy.  
‚Ä¢ [Unenjoyable, to put it mildly] for NOT SO FUN.  ‚Äú‚Ä¶ to put it mildly‚Äù made me think that the answer would be a word that exaggerates the meaning of ‚Äúunenjoyable‚Äù, but no ‚Äì ""... to put it mildly"" is literal!  A terrific misdirect, but still gettable because, once again, it‚Äôs Monday-easily crossed.  This hints at the rewards that come as the puzzles move through the week, when not all clues are simply definitions of their answers.

Bravo on these, editors and Neil!

Neil is no stranger to indirect cluing.  Two of his five puzzles are themeless, and here‚Äôs an example of his cluing acumen from one of them: [Hearing aids, in brief] *  (three letters).

One thing I liked about today‚Äôs puzzle was that post-solve reverie where I was imagining all the masterpieces a kid could make with the four theme-answer items, from a paper-plate faces to lovely non-specific pastiches.

You pushed my happy-button with your puzzle, today, NPW. Thank you so much for that!

"I'm sure this will be old news to many of you, but Elmer's Products, Inc., the manufacturer of Glue-All, was founded in 1947 as a subsidiary of the Borden dairy company. It's mascot, Elmer the Bull, was designed to be the mate of Elsie the Cow. Love in the grocery aisles. The original glues were based on casein, a milk product (and not, as I had long assumed, the boiled-down carcasses of superannuated dairy cattle); although Elmer's Glue-All was an all-artificial adhesive from the very start.

But TIL that the company founder, Gail Borden (1801-1874), was not only the inventor of sweetened condensed milk, but a major player in the Texas War of Independence.

"Wondering what to make from all those paper plates, cottonballs, uncooked macaroni, and pipe cleaners? Consult Gerry Fleming's *Scrap Craft for Youth Groups* (1969;  ISBN-10: 0381970159):

""Here are craft projects that can be made by youngsters at a cost usually ten cents each (1969) or less - a treasure trove for group leaders. The secret is to use scrap and items that cost next to nothing: rags, discarded broomsticks, cardboard, newsprint, rubber bands, old socks, etc. All projects are designed for 8 to 10 year olds to be capable of them. The combination of simplicity with economy makes this an invaluable book for Cub Scout den mothers, church group leaders, camp counselors, playground directors, teachers, parents and every other leader responsible for recreation in small or large groups of children. Illustrated.""

Of course, the primary use of Elmer's Glue was smearing it on one's fingertips, letting it set, then peeling it off and seeing the imprint of one's fingerprints. Forensics for eight-year-olds.

"Sweet! And rife with costume ideas for Halloween: the pirate could fashion a peg leg from aged pine oars. There are sleds for your Citizen Kane costumes: just write ""Rosebud"" on them and you're set.  And there are cautionary notes: it is perhaps better to dress up as Ariel or Nemo rather than invent a character of your own, better a naked lie than an ill-dressed lie, such as a lariat-twirling cowboy in a top hat, or a diva playing viola, or a CBer in an Opal. Those costumes are full of plot holes. A real costume may be banal, but just think if it rains while you're out trick-or-treating, and all those cottonballs you glued to your face for Lincoln's beard get wet and start to ooze down your chin in one messy pap, a pool of rainwater dripping from the brim of your top hat, won't you start thinking ""This is not so fun""?

"Today has been a very puzzling day for me in that I completed the Saturday, Sunday, and Monday puzzles all today. 

I had a jam-packed day of fun yesterday and never got around to doing the puzzle. Happily, since I completed it before the Sunday puzzle, I still got a gold star. I don't know if there's rhyme or reason to when it's too late or what order you do them in, but I'm glad of it because I made it through Saturday's puzzle with no problems...  I earned my huzzah and in better than average time. 

I actually found Sunday to be tougher for me than Saturday this week. My trickiest spot was in the middle top... With IKEBANA and OBES. Neither of which I knew, so I put in OlES and had put in FINal on the first go-round instead of FINIS and missed that it filled out Serena incorrectly. I let aKElANA fill itself out. When I looked at it again after not getting the happy music, I quickly corrected SERENA and then had to take a stab or two at where IKEBANA and OBES crossed. All good though! 

Enjoyed the cute themes for both Sunday and Monday!  It was so much puzzling that I am blurring what clues I enjoyed in each but I did think it was a good weekend and a good start to the new week of puzzles.
