"I am all for this!!!  One of my best Sunday and I have the Olympic theme to thank for it.  As I typically solve Sundays the first go-around  online in just the “clue” form, I was slower because I didn’t catch onto the color “help” right away.  Once I switched back into normal view, I solved much faster.  As a huge Olympic nut, I loved the imagery of this, as well as the ingenious and fun clueing, of the theme!  Oddly enough, I got stuck on the “revealer” clue, which I kept returning to OLYMPICring instead of the real answer.  Still solid and loved the nod to my favorite tile of year (despite the negativity- I love the ideal that the world can come together to compete and love one another/support another through some of our most poignant and powerful times in a life.

"I’d like to thank such commenters here as Barry Ancona, CaptainQuahog and Steve L for reinforcing my decision to cancel my subscription. Apparently when you become an excellent crossword solver, you also turn into a conceited elitist who looks down on everybody else for not having the same knowledge base as they do. I only wish the NYT would publish a crossword puzzle with lots of video game side character names in it so I could laugh at all the longtime commenters who couldn’t get the answer because they were “not inferable.”

If you would like proof, I’d be more than happy to email you a screenshot of my subscription cancellation confirmation and my bank account statement showing the $40 being refunded to my account. The only reason I am able to continue commenting here or solving puzzles is because my cancellation won’t take effect until the next billing cycle next June.

"I liked this expansive, athletic grid of a puzzle. It was big! I too had issues w/barely seeing where I was in the puzzle cuz of the depth of color in the ""rings""… my workaround (not having a stone tablet nor a bigscreen) was to use >arrows< to skip to next or previous clue, keeping my eyes on the grid, & I'd then kinda see which the 'current' word was. Not easy, & sometimes had to toggle back & forth to see it, but still worth it.

I imagine if they'd used lighter, pastel colors instead of these deep tones it mighta made their MEANING more, uh, opaque— i.e red might seem pink, yellow➡off-white, etc… as it was, I wondered if grey MAGIC was a thing, but you CAN'T have squares be black. Yes someone above suggested maybe NYT coulda used black squares w/white font— which sounds kinda cool— but even if easily doable tech (who knows) I think patches of jet-black squares for the FILL (near black squares which AREN'T 'fill' squares) would just be even MORE confusing. So all in all I think it was— at least subjectively, esp w/my gimmick ro kinda flush out the ""current"" word— worth it.

I hadn't thought of turning off overlays, great option to know of (& once the color 'theme' dawned, even w/only greyscale one could scribble down a list of where each color ring was, to help in the solve).

As to the color blindness problem—seems like a simple solution would be to include an option in the tools or settings to turn on an indication of square colors in the clueing (e.g. Detailed plan of action (blue). Or a note indicating that 36a, 79a, 43d, 45d are blue).",3,neutral,0.6160551905632019

"I can sympathize with color blind puzzle solvers. Personally, I found the colored rings only mildly annoying. Without the colors, though, many of the clues for words on the rings would have been obscure (as they probably were for those who are color blind). Is there a better way to present a theme like this? I can't think of one offhand.

Perhaps the proper way to think about this sort of embellishment is to accept it as another challenge, the way we accept rebuses and other trickery -- pleasing for some and a bane for others.  As they say in computing circles, with Pollyanna charm: ""It's not a bug; it's a feature.""

I have 20/20 vision, but reading this puzzle was as hard as reading a 3-point font ingredients list. Heavy-duty squinting and craning, zooming in and out. I'm not good enough at crosswords to print it out and then fill it in -- I don't have enough erasers!

"I’m so glad I have overlays off as the default in my app. In this case, not because it makes it easier to tell where you are in this puzzle, but because it adds another element to figure out in the puzzle (I also don’t look at the title until I finish).

With overlays on, it is clear from the start that the Olympic logo is depicted, making the theme pretty obvious. With just grey (all the same shade) it is not clear at all what is going on or even that the shaded squares form five interlocking rings.

I got RING BEARER  pretty quickly, but FRODO BAGGINS was one letter too long for 114a 🤓. I soon figured out that colors had to be prepended to the shaded answers, and then soon after that realized it must be an Olympic theme.

"Generally an enjoyable and clever puzzle.

Yes, I know the squares are numbered, but on my tablet the numbers are generally quite small, especially in the larger Sunday grid. Don’t get me wrong: I did enjoy it for the most part but maybe in the future the editors and coders (I assume there are coders) could take the issue of colored squares into account.

I did, however, chuckle at 81 A [BLACK] OLIVE, because of the mild arguments about it as a pizza topping on Friday. On Friday, olives-on-pizza is a divisive issue; today it’s supreme.

That network turned out to be not so complicated, but I was already charmed, and the good mood held throughout the fill-in.

Paolo loves to wordplay in his clues.  This is the man who once took an ordinary answer – HELMET – and made it extraordinary through his clue [Knight cap].  Today he did the same with RENT (clued “Number for a letter?”), GREENHOUSE (clued “What has a lot of room to grow?”), and NONS, (clued “Negative Nancy words?”).

That last one is SO clever.  Sure, punning on the French city Nancy has happened aplenty in crosswords.  But here, Paolo beautifully misdirects, because a “Negative Nancy” is a thing, like a Debby Downer and Doubting Thomas.  So, Paolo’s clue double hides the Nancy pun – brilliant!

There does not appear to be a place for Strands comments (I could be wrong) so I am going to say it here:  Today's Strands was absolutely wonderful.  It made me happy.,18,positive,0.8403300046920776

But we must confront our fears.",4,negative,0.8144437074661255

"Great, clever puzzle! Fun solve and I loved catching on to the ring theme.",14,positive,0.9869105219841003
"A puzzle that immediately draws a smile when you see the colors and the rings. Once you grasp the concept, it is perhaps too quickly solved for a Sunday. But, I'm feeling the Olympic spirit, so this was enjoyable. Plus vite, plus haut, plus fort – ensemble.",33,positive,0.9447584748268127
"Unfortunately, I can’t read much of this puzzle. The colors make it difficult to see where the numbers are and  where the answers go. Does anyone else have a similar problem?  I’m wondering if it would be clearer in print.",60,negative,0.8704140186309814
"Puzzle was easy; theme was cute; data entry was absolutely miserable!

As others have already said, the color handling made it nearly impossible to see what row or column was being highlighted in the web version of this puzzle.  It was a real chore.

Admittedly I was already pushing the limits by doing Sunday puzzles on a cell phone screen, but today's interface was punishing.

Please don't do this again.  The pain was not worth it for the modest gain of cluing simple answers like blue birds and yellow bellies.

Puzzle overall was fine, although really too easy for a Sunday by my expectations....",31,negative,0.6069172620773315

"Lovely, elegant puzzle! The rings alone are quite an accomplishment, never mind the rest of the grid. Hats off to Paolo!

I experienced a weird glitch in the iOS app: on filling in the last empty square, I got the dreaded “Something’s amiss…” popup dialog. After several minutes of hunting for a mistake, I found a contender— but when I tried to change it, I couldn’t. It was only then that I noticed the time had stopped. The puzzle was already solved! (I wasn’t expecting a gold medal, but some acknowledgement would have been nice! ;-)",6,positive,0.9527342915534973
"The gimme at 1A caused me no end of trouble when I mentally switched the order of the clue words and confidently slapped in Bar, no way I could make sense of the downs. 
BRA made it a whole lot easier.  Something about pride going before…?",6,negative,0.5933999419212341

"In case anyone is wondering, the normal Sunday grid is 21 x 21, and today's is 19 x 23, making today's puzzle four squares fewer than the usual Sunday.

You're welcome.

fun but almost impossible to see which clue is highlighted and active through all the colors.,171,neutral,0.5369048714637756
"And the gold medal goes to… Paolo!

How often does one gasp “oh wow” when first opening the puzzle?

The BLUEPRINT gave the blueprint for how this would work, so it wasn’t the hardest thing ever, but it was fun to zip around the rings filling them in.

The hardest thing was navigating the colors to know which entry I was on. Got a little dizzy- just like I would if attempting any of the amazing physical feats the Olympians perform.

Oh well we all have our talents. Today I won a gold medal in raspberry picking.",93,positive,0.8309286832809448
