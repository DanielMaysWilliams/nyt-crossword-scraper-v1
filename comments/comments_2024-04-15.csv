(@HeathieJ, thinking of you!)

Thankfully, there were no run-the-alphabet areas in this zippy puzzle. I did get a little bogged down in the middle west, but it was no Heartbreak Hill and I was able to push through.

I have to confess, the theme didn't do much for me -- but the work that went into crafting the grid with those constraints really paid off with a winner of a Monday puzzle! There were plenty of spots that brought as smile as I solved: URDU, EFFACE, PESTO, SONIC BOOM... 

Congratulations, Amanda. Keep it up!!

"Nice Monday, smooth, liked it. 

I got the revealer rather easily because, although I don't remember the book perfectly (I've read a lot of books), the phase ""As above, so below"" made me instantly think of Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere, which I remember as being a reasonably good book for those who like the author.

"Sweetest moment for me was uncovering the reveal, then seeing it reflected in the gray squares.  Simultaneously, two happy-pings rang out.  One, because the AS above, SO below in the gray squares is so elegant.  And two, because I was vexed as to what the letters in the gray squares could mean, and this beautifully solved the riddle.  

The best I could come up with, to that point, was that this was a tribute puzzle to Sammy SOSA, but my brain kept saying, ‚ÄúNah‚Äù.

There were plenty of serendipities to buoy my mood: 
‚Ä¢ Given than Amanda is a data scientist, lovely to see a backward DATA in the grid.  
‚Ä¢ Two M-sandwiched palindromes (MUM, MAAM), to accompany OSSO and ESE.
‚Ä¢ Seeing that SONIC BOOM is a NYT puzzle debut.  How could this not have been in the puzzle for more than 80 years?

"For anyone unfamiliar with the book *Invisible Cities* by the great Italian author Italo Calvino, here's a description of the town of Perinthia: 

""Summoned to lay down the rules for the foundation of Perinthia, the astronomers established the place and the day according to the position of the stars; they drew the intersecting lines of the decumanus and the cardo, the first oriented to the passage of the sun and the other like the axis on which the heavens turn. They divided the map according to the twelve houses of the zodiac so that each temple and each neighborhood would receive the proper influence of the favoring constellations; they fixed the point in the walls where gates should be cut, foreseeing how each would frame and eclipse of the moon in the next thousand years. Perinthia -- they guaranteed -- would reflect the harmony of the firmament; nature's reason and the gods' benevolence would shape the inhabitants' destinies.

Following the astronomers' calculations precisely, Perinthia was constructed; various peoples came to populate it; the first generation born in Perinthia began to grow within its walls; and these citizens reached the age to marry and have children.

In Perinthia's streets and square today you enter cripples, dwarfs, hunchbacks, obese men, bearded women. But the worse cannot be seen; guttural howls are heard from cellars and lofts, where families hide children with three heads or with six legs.",6,neutral,0.8516426086425781

"I wasn't familiar with AS ABOVE, SO BELOW, but I like it. A lot!  It is a bit reminiscent to me of the Lord's Prayer. Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven... 

Nice puzzle and an interesting theme to ponder. 

On a completely different note, I feel a need to tell you all that tonight my husband and I watched a British mystery, which is very much not unusual for us, but in this one, a person was murdered by a sword... Or was it an epee!? 

As soon as I saw the murder victim with the fencing weapon in him, I said to my husband, who fenced for many years when he was younger, do you think that's an epee? He was like, what!? And I said ""An epee, man! An epee!"" He said, ""Uh, I guess I need to see the it better... "" And I said, ""I don't, it's an epee!"" 

What I lacked in actual knowledge, I more than made up for in jesting confidence. As the murder case went on, it was indeed an antique epee. My husband, as is often unreasonably the case, was incredibly impressed with my brilliance. I in my usual fashion did some ridiculous version of a touchdown dance. Life is hard, but good!

I did then confess that the only reason I know of the existence of epees is from my new journey into crosswords. When I first started I had no idea what a ""foil alternative"" or some such was. It's nice that my new hobby / obsession has allowed me to continue to impress my husband after almost 25 years together. üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÇ",31,positive,0.8992612361907959

"Hi Sam,

Perhaps you and Caitlin and Deb could rename the Tricky Clues section of the Wordplay column. None of the six clues cited today are tricky. People may not know the answers, but the clues are straightforward. ASUS (56D) is debut, and not in my vocabulary, so I filled it from the crosses. But the clue -- Taiwanese tech company --  was hardly tricky. 32D was tricky only if you misread ""green house"" as ""greenhouse,"" and that may have been helpful as a ""trick"" to avoid. Otherwise, you're just giving answers to random clues, which is fine but IMO should have another heading. I wish Tricky Clues actually just gave advice on dealing with tricky clues.
