"First off, a solid puzzle.  Thanks, Alex Tomlinson.  I felt all the while that I wasn't on the constructor's wavelength, but no complaints.

I was going to comment on 35d Housework? versus House work? but naturally others have beaten me to the punch.  So instead I'll make a meta-comment:

I think that sometimes when people say that a clue ""should have been"" such and such, they're commenting less about correctness but instead about quality: a clue ""would have been better if it had been"" such and such. At least that's the way I've come to think about my own judgment calls. Is a clue literally incorrect? Sure, that happens all the time, but it's the nature of crossword puzzles. Could a clue be improved? That's an aesthetic call, about which there are reasonable disagreements.",4,positive,0.7293989062309265

Fine, fixed on crosses in a few seconds with a moment of appreciation for the irony of a British constructor providing us with an American spelling of possibly the only word we actually prefer to spell the British way. Marquee spanners solved with no second-guessing.

So why did this still take me an hour? Because, for the life of me, I could not think of LAwS or wHOM. Even after considering that House might refer to Congress. Even after trying desperately to make “thou” fit, and thinking of pronouns in other languages despite the clue clearly looking for an English word. I mean… HOw? I have an English degree—I know some pronouns. I worked for the House of Representatives for three years—I know the House does some law stuff. And yet I had to read the column FTAWIN (for the actual “W” I needed).

I don’t even know if I enjoyed this, but it’s not the constructor’s fault and he should be proud of his debut. I’m blaming COVID for my brain not quite working right this week.

"New personal Friday best FTW! (just under 17 mins)

I'm another Brit who can't stand cryptic crosswords, but I'm very much a fan of the variety of tricksy strategies played by different days of the NYT puzzles. This year I've got very into crosswords and word puzzles and the like, and while the main thing I wanted from the NYT Games sub I signed up for in June was the Spelling Bee, I slowly got into the crosswords as well. Looking back in the app, every month from September onwards has a 50/50 mix of gold completed icons vs either belated blues or unfinished/unattempted whites, but I'm currently on a 2 week gold streak, as well as going back to fill in some of the gaps!

"Weird that a Brit would create a puzzle with the (to my eyes) overly Americanized (to the point it's unfamiliar to me, an American) spelling OCHER. I had had BEARDS for 18D but rejected it as OCHre was becoming my preferred answer to 29A, and that meant when I had BY___ for 23A, ""air"" was a plausible way to complete it.

My first instinct for 1A was ""knot"" or some word that was a subunit for a nautical mile. Count me among those that had tHeM for 43A; it actually took the column to get me to HOLIDAY as the ending to 5D, as opposed to ""(word ending in I) DAY"", because the H and the M fit their respective Downs too well for me to back off my initial guess. I actually thought ""half full?"" was pointing at something about the word itself but was expecting it to literally be the letters involved, so the entry seemed too long for that.

Wiki points out that it is also used in Australian Rules Football with regard to spectacular marks (“speckles”) (BTW, look up 6’11” American , Mason Cox, if you haven’t already). Wiki makes no mention of ski jumping.  An interesting article (linked below) is “The Freaky Physics of Ski Jump” from the Smithsonian Magazine. Seems if you or I jump in the air as high as possible, we can stay aloft for about half a second. Michael Jordon could stay off the ground close to one second.

Tough and fun are the buttons that happify my brain.

Alex’s debut today definitely had that flavor, bringing a twinkle to my eyes with its humor and leaving me with glorious post-workout satisfaction.  

Big “Hah!” at finally getting [Number in a count].  Another at getting ELS.  Joy at the newness of running into answers I’ve never seen before in a Times puzzle, for instance, the following six: AND STAY OUT, AVID READER, CHILDLIKE WONDER, HALLMARK HOLIDAY, PASTRY CHEF, and SALTED NUTS.

Sweet serendipity in having a Pledge of Allegiance clue, along with KEY, as in Francis Scott, in REKEY.  

And speaking of looking at the night sky with childlike wonder, there was that unforgettable night in Hawaii many years ago, with the countless stars blazing unhindered, that my wife and I still remind each other about.

"That took me a lot longer than usual. As I look through the puzzle, I'm not sure why. The completed grid looks pleasant and welcoming enough.

I _did_ have OCHre in there for way too long. When did we start spelling it OCHER? And I've always called it a Hawaiian shirt -- never even heard of ALOHASHIRT, although it's not a streatch, and the crosses helped me figure that out pretty early.

Now that I think about it, the longer answers in this puzzle filled in more in pieces than usual. I had NUTS and HOLIDAY and SHIRT, but not the front part. I had RAREGEt, which seems to me like a very legitimate way for Howard and Booey to describe Springsteen's appearance on Howard 100, which was indeed one in a million. Of course, a Springsteen interview is also a RAREGEM.

LIANA and HALLMARKHOLIDAY were among my last fills, the former for good reason, the latter I should have had quite a bit sooner. HANGTIME added too many minutes to my solve time -- not difficult, but I just didn't get it.

I'll be out there at least a couple more times this morning. I do that every morning and every night. So that one answer made this puzzle unusually pleasing.

Typically 20 or 30 or so, but occasionally double that number. But... yesterday afternoon I went out back and couldn't believe what I was seeing. All the large barren trees that were visible in the neighborhood were rife with blackbirds and there were also a large number on the ground in at least a few yards; and I'm sure there were many more that I couldn't see.

Now that I've completed it for realz, this one's a rare gem. Childlike wonder plus avid reader? Inuk and Caleb? (I bet a lot of you had CAMEL at first: fess up!). My mother termed nearly every holiday a Hallmark Holiday and refused to celebrate any of them, you name it. In desperation we finally got her to grudgingly honor Beethoven's birthday (Dec. 16) in lieu of Xmas or Chanukah (tonight, Thursday, being the last night of it this year, happy Hallmark Holiday to those who celebrate it, signed, Mom) with a German chocolate cake. 

But it was the total effect of this puzzle that caught me, its cosmology, sense of awe, beginning with reference to the pale blue ball of earth, then the childlike wonder of it all, Nye supplying a rationality to it, and Lama a spiritual rekeying of the same question, are we simply a mote in God's eye? I thought of Arthur C. Clarke's classic, ""The Nine Billion Names of God"" which takes place at a Tibetan lamasery: monks have been chanting for centuries the nine billion names of God, and when they utter the last, the universe will end. Last line: ""Overhead, without any fuss, the stars were going out.""",47,neutral,0.4681365489959717
"For a long time, I had THEM at 43A, which made 5D HALLMARK HELIDAY. I was tickled by that and was a little sad to realize it wasn’t an actual thing.",25,negative,0.7349259257316589
"Congratulations on a fun NYT debut, Mr. Tomlinson!

I learned the term HALLMARK HOLIDAY just a few days ago, from a New Yorker puzzle. 

As someone who spent his professional career helping the Texas Legislature craft LAWS, I was a bit chagrined to be baffled by that clue until almost the end.

Thanks!",8,positive,0.9525836706161499
"I loved this one, especially the crossing spanners, both quite appropriate for this time of year, punctuated by a MALL. Congrats on your debut, Alex.

The puzzle may be billed as a Friday themeless but for me it evokes a powerful tug of wanderlust. 

Why not set SAIL with me (cf. SPAR and SPAN), before the tide EBBs, on a voyage around the world BY SEA? 

I'll wear my ALOHA SHIRT, and grab my rod, REEL, and NET, while humming a few BARS of a sea shanty. We'll provision the ship so that we never GO DRY. (AND STAY OUT, if you're a TEETOTALER).

Later, you can meet me UP TOP, and we'll gaze at the night sky with CHILDLIKE WONDER. Recalling some Bill NYE YouTube episode, we'll marvel at our PALE blue dot, perhaps a RARE GEM of life set among the stars.

As time passes, I'll start to feel like an old TAR, sporting one of those BEARDS. 

Happy Friday!",31,positive,0.9695194363594055
"Nice debut - as fun and nearly as fast as a Robyn Weintraub Friday!

Minor quibble with 16A though - does ""classic"" mean back in the good ole days, but no longer? Because I'd LOVE to get some salted nuts on a flight, haven't seen that in many years. ANA, JAL, Delta, United, all I get are bland mini rice crackers with my beers.",7,positive,0.9115044474601746
"34A was worth the price of admission for the entire year for me!  I love to watch the night skies which, in Seattle, requires a hearty dose of stubbornness and optimism.  
Author Douglas Chadwick refers to science as an organized form of wonder.  I love that. Sometimes it is difficult to explain what we scientists and engineers do and the sheer beauty of exploration, but I think this phrase communicates it in a way that crosses boundaries.  It conveys the creativity that some fail to recognize in us.",14,positive,0.9754912257194519
"RARE GEM of a puzzle. The perfect blend of sparkling entries like HALLMARK HOLIDAY, CHILDLIKE WONDER, ALOHA SHIRT and PASTRY CHEF with clever wordplay like ”Bookie?” (AVID READER), “Housework?” (LAWS) and “Half full?"" (ELS).  

Also learned a new word, nephalist. 

Congratulations, Alex, on your NYT debut. Nicely done.",23,positive,0.9301591515541077

"Left side/right side puzzle for me.  Right side was mainly a (fun) breeze.  Left side was mainly a (fun) tussle.  Lots of joy throughout, from HANG TIME to that lovely central grid spanner.  

Refraining from commenting on MEDIA BIAS.  Have to do a lot of refraining in these comments and suspect that will be the case even more so next year.  Just want to say that every day I wonder how in the world I can do crosswords and comment about them and make silly puns and jokes and occasional poems, and engage in ongoing discussions about arcana, while there is so much suffering and sorrow and cause for dread in this world. I’m sure that I’m not alone in that feeling.  OTOH this is an oasis of sanity, kindness and humor, and we must take our life rafts where we find them.  Grateful for this place and all of you, and Deb, Caitlin, Sam, Will &Co., and our wonderfully inventive and brilliant constructors.  To all, nephalists and non-nephalists alike, I raise my seltzer water in salute.  Skoal!",67,positive,0.924118161201477

"I think those who complained that the Thursday puzzle was too easy might be dismayed about the Friday one, as well.  I finished Thursday's in 62% of my Thursday average, and I finished the Friday one just about as fast, relative to my average.

Some old-time crosswordese in there with LIANA, which has experienced somewhat of a revival in the past two years, but was much more widely seen in the Pre-Shortz Era.

CALEB was one of the scouts sent by Moses when the Israelites finally approached the Promised Land, but I wonder how well known he is to the average solver.  With LOCUSTS, this puzzle has both ends of the Exodus out of Egypt.

I certainly didn't know Maradona's team's name.  I relied on the crosses.

INUK is the singular form of the better known (and more widely used in NYT crosswords, by 56-1) plural INUIT.  

Nice clue for NYE; nice try if you thought you could get it by me, though.  

Didn't get BALLS the first time around, and never got back to thinking about it until I read the column, as it filled itself in via the crosses.  Interesting how SALTED NUTS are hanging right on top of BALLS.

Interesting stat about ANTS--makes me wonder, how does one conduct an ant census?  Wasn't familiar with ""Nephalist"", but I had enough letters already in to guess TEETOTALER.",16,neutral,0.6629443168640137
