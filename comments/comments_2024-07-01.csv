"This is a favorite Monday, for sure! I had two rewrites. The first was  40A RHINE because I can rarely keep my rivers straight. They're all loosey goosey in my head but which one comes out without crosses is kinda like those bingo ball spinner thingies... something's gonna pop out but who knows which! But it wasn't a hard fix when I got to SKoNTIGHT. 

Second one was 5D. They got me good on that one‚Äîand I am here for it! First GAzebo, then GARden... ended up changing the ending through crosses, reread the clue, scratched my head for a hot second, then laughed at myself. Love it! 

I got all the theme answers before the revealer and I chuckled out loud when I got the FORTH RIGHT Love it! 

Favorite clue was (among A TON of great ones) 13D‚ÄîTWAIN.

"Backtracking to a thread about Sunday‚Äôs puzzle (my comments rarely come through on weekends), where the specter of playing in F-sharp major was raised.

On the piano, F-sharp major and its enharmonic equivalent G-flat major are among the easiest keys to _play_. In those keys, the keyboard lies under the fingers beautifully and chords are easily and intuitively formed. It was famously the only key Irving Berlin played in; his piano had a special clutch mechanism to raise or lower the sounding pitch while he just played in that one key. The piano is in the Smithsonian.

However, _reading_ music in keys with more sharps and flats is more challenging for most players until they achieve a certain breakthrough moment where ‚Äúeverything is relative‚Äù - where the score‚Äôs meanings become transparent. The same breakthrough allows for transposing at sight to be done fluently ‚Äî though certain transpositions are always going to be easiest (any flat key to its natural and vice versa, piece of cake) or hardest (C minor down to B minor is no picnic).

Someone also mentioned horns and trumpets. For lots of reasons, those players can‚Äôt get far beyond the beginning stage before already making that leap to not caring what pitch is written but simply understanding what sound is required.",3,neutral,0.825954020023346

"1. Congratulations, Margi! A smooth solving experience is expected on Monday, but one felt something special here. That was confirmed in the comments where so many of our favorite contributors (some of whom are also constructors) weighed in to note the quality of this notable debut. Loved the puzzle and your backstory on the challenge of its evolution. It could be required reading for all who dream of constructing.

2. Sam, solving definitely varies with device. Once upon a time, in my ill-spent youth, I was a devoted ink & paper person. I later became accustomed to a tablet and the guilty pleasure of deleting. Experimenting  with my phone, I thought the small size and isolated clue display would be more challenging, but my phone solve times are consistently under average (by which I mean not quite as slow‚Ä¶). Now I find myself thinking about a stone tablet. Thanks, Barry.

"Mondays, for me, an experienced solver, are often autofill fests, where I go from ‚ÄúOn your mark, get set‚Ä¶‚Äù to ‚ÄúGone!‚Äù in an eyeblink.  

What I liked today was that yes, the puzzle filled in, in short order, but no, it wasn‚Äôt autofill.  A good number of times the clues were genuine riddles, where I had to stop and think, and in many instances, I was stymied until the crosses came.

And, well edited as this puzzle was, each time this happened, the crosses were very easy ‚Äì this is Monday after all.

But those stymie-ing riddles ‚Äì short lasting though they were ‚Äì what a Monday treat!  More like this, please!

Then there were the other plusses.  The clever way to make a theme out of four homophones.  Lovely non-theme answers (TALON, CONTESSA, RIGOR), even abutting palindromes (ENE and TOT).  All capped by a heartwarming constructor note.

Margi, going from never having made a puzzle to NYT publication in a year-and-a-half is most impressive, and your method ‚Äì practice, persistence, linking with mentors ‚Äì shows how smart you are.

"Sam, 

My father, three brothers, and I were in hot competition with the NYT crossword by the time I was in high school. (Dad would howl with indignation if anyone dared fill in the crossword on his paper without permission.) We advanced to the point at which family honor required that we solve in pen (red ink for the ostentatiously brave). Hence, I trained never to write in the answer unless I was sure of the solution. The process may take a bit longer, but not by much, as my completion times remain competitive.  I now solve on tablet, but hold to the same method, so I almost never correct an entry. Today was no exception. 

√Ä chacun son go√ªt, as they say, though this discussion is not really about taste as it is about technique. One simply holds the options in one's mind until the answer is clear; a sort of internal trial and error approach by use of synaptic erasers, and, thus,  fundamentally the same program as yours.",6,neutral,0.6683171391487122

I look forward to the crossword every day, and whether I like it or not (and I really liked this one) it's like an adventure waiting to happen.

"A nice, breezy Monday puzzle.

A small usage note, however:

‚ÄúFTW‚Äù isn‚Äôt used to proclaim one‚Äôs own victory‚Äîat least not usually. It‚Äôs normally used to suggest that a particular thing is very good at what it does, and that its use could hypothetically lead (or has led) to victory. ‚ÄúX FTW‚Äù means ‚ÄúX is very good‚Äù; ‚ÄúMichael Jordan FTW‚Äù might be written about an old Bulls game to acknowledge Jordan‚Äôs dominance of the court, regardless of which team you were rooting for (to offer an example the older, non-video-game-oriented crowd will likely understand). Sometimes this might be used to celebrate a personal victory, but it wouldn‚Äôt be used on its own‚Äîit would be preceded by whatever you thought contributed most to that victory, and could just as easily be used by the loser to insult reliance on what they consider an unfair strategy, e.g. ‚Äúfaking injuries FTW‚Äù in the context of undue soccer penalties.
