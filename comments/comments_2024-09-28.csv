As many others have pointed out, "".1111, .2222, .3333, etc."" for NINTHS is a bit dodgy. But it's not truly incorrect as some have claimed. For example, .1111 is *exactly* .9999 ninths. No one said ninths can only be counted in whole numbers!

Whew!  Saved by those last .1111 seconds!

Despite having the gimmes of AGATHA, my favorite author of all time, and SMITH, my alma mater, I found this puzzle exceedingly hard and had to simply ""keep the faith"" that I would actually finish the thing if I tried hard enough.

""Pick up""= ANSWER did not make me smile.  If you twist yourself into a pretzel, I suppose you can explain/justify it, but I really don't like it.  Same with ""Directive to get down"" for LET'S DANCE.   Also, the less said about EXACTO as a new way of saying ""exactly"", the better.

Is it my generation, where I live, or my diet preferences that make HORCHATA so unknown to me?    I wanted HOTsomething-or-other.

Some clues I don't understand, like the one for TOT. ""Sticky fingered sort?"": why? I'm not particularly familiar with small kids. Are their fingers the epitome of stickiness? Or maybe not since there is a question mark there, implying above-average trickery.

"Sometimes I wonder if I'm a better solver than I would be if I wasn't kind of lazy.

I quite often fill in answer, never really checking the crosses.

I was stumped by 47A.  Then I had a landslide of other fills, and didn't even notice it came out to BACNE.  Huh!  Never heard of it until I got to the comments after having filled it in.

And I didn't get distracted by the problem discussed below about 62A.  I didn't even notice there was no indication that the digits repeated indefinitely.  I just kind of automatically saw them there, because I've seen stuff like that in all kinds of situations in math.

So I think I owe whatever ability I have to solve these puzzles  to my inattention to detail.",13,negative,0.47876694798469543

"A fun, breezy puzzle-solving experience that would have been under X minutes but for AtrA before AFTA, ON the set before ON SCREEN and rear before RUMP.

I loved seeing HORCHATA (which I haven‚Äôt made in a while) and the great MOE Tucker. (But please, no more BACNE.)

Thanks for the fun, Ms Seikel!",8,positive,0.9398818612098694
"So.. hard!  Nearly a streak breaker for me, but persistence (knocking my head against the phone bezel repeatedly; also a great deal of staring) paid off and I got through the somewhat terrifying grid.

I was pleasantly surprised to discover Tecumseh and horchata and Mr. Lopez could all be pulled from the deep recesses of my head; I didn't think I knew them.  17 down was an interesting development.  I've never heard ""exacto"" but won't quibble.

I was stuck longest in the upper right.  Took me forever to realize the intercessor was both (a) two words and (b) using a religious abbreviation.  Almost seemed unfair, that one.

All in all I enjoyed it but for me this was one hard puzzle and definitely a Saturday!

"A very nice fact-heavy puzzle, many of which I was able to enter straight away. (Hi AGATHA, TECUMSEH, MOE, et al)
And very little, if any, vague, could be anything at all phrases, so not very Saturday-like.  I enjoyed solving it.
Thanks, Margaret.",8,positive,0.9612428545951843
"I needed help with this one, but as so often happens, the tricky ones in the column were the ones I already had. I managed to let go of angora COWS (please don't laugh) to get the upcountry ones, and changed Saint Jude to STANTHONY, (what do I know about saints??), got back on track by ACTingNORMAL but the SW corner stopped me cold. 

This was an old style Saturday puzzle, the kind that makes your brain hurt because you can't just give up. I loved it even at the same time it was making my teeth ache.  Thank you, Margaret Seikel, you cooked up a honey of a puzzle.",17,neutral,0.48278212547302246

"This puzzle generally made me feel old and out of touch, so it was a bit of a slog, but at least there was the ‚ÄúI Love Lucy‚Äù airer concession to those of us more up on days of yore.",15,negative,0.5511061549186707
"A nice, challenging puzzle, that to my surprise was over more quickly than I anticipated, despite several wrong turns (atra before AFTA, shetlandcow before HIGHLANDCOW, tuneup [?] before FUNRUN).  I enjoyed the clues for SEEDCAPITAL, PLUMBERS, and LETSDANCE.  As proof that the universe works in mysterious ways, while pondering ‚Äúdirective to get down,‚Äù the playlist I was was listening to on shuffle came up with Josh Ritter‚Äôs Getting Ready To Get Down, and presto, I had my aha moment courtesy of external stimuli rather than my own reasoning.

It was great to see Maureen ‚ÄúMoe‚Äù Tucker get a spot in the puzzle.  As a female drummer in a rock band, and a very influential rock band at that, in the sixties she was a real pioneer.  As a young teen in the sixties making the transition from top 40 radio to fm rock hearing the Velvets for the first time was an eye opener for me.  Hearing Lou Reed sing Heroin awakened me to the fact that the world was a darker place than my little suburban cocoon, and that music could be about much more than the simple emotions most often plumbed in pop music.  That was one of my first steps on a journey that continues to this day.",35,positive,0.9221864342689514

"I'm starting to find that Margaret Seikel is one of my favorite new constructors.  Her puzzles are always very challenging, yet fair.  I liked the clue for AORTAE a lot (and had a hunch that she was going in that direction).  ATRA before AFTA and Dark AGES before SIDE before MODE slowed me down just enough.

My take for the logic behind NINTHS is not that .3333 is one-ninth of 3, but rather that .1111 is simply 1/9, .2222 is 2/9, and .3333 is 3/9.",41,positive,0.953490674495697
