A few years later, I did a cover story on another WPA artist who lived across the street from him. Both are well known, but the second one is much more famous...you've see his sculptures at the FDR memorial in DC... in fact, the first artist was his model for the first person in line at the Breadline.

"ANTZ crossing ZEKE at the ""Z"" right next to MAHERSHALAALI crossing ZEKE at the ""E"" could easily trip someone up.  All three of the answers are of the ""you know it or you don't"" category, and if you don't know two out of the three, I'm not sure how you would ever figure this section out without resorting to guessing random letters.",10,neutral,0.5266467332839966
"Could the Word Play contributors please answer clues that can‚Äôt be googled?

Still have no clue as to [serving dishes], or [frustrating players in GO FISH?]

It makes me think you didn‚Äôt actually solve the puzzle and and just provided answers you googled so you could feign knowledge.",8,negative,0.7301093339920044
"Definitely an autocheck puzzle for me around the halfway point. Not really bad in any way, but filled with terms and places/people I had no hope of guessing. I‚Äôm not a fan of some of the clues: I doubt I ever would have gotten the northwest and southwest corners without autocheck (the frustrating Go Fish players clue was especially bad, and I had just never heard that Latin phrase, so it could have been anything), and trying to guess the random name of a Muslim actor you‚Äôve never heard of is incredibly difficult if you barely have any headway in the middle. 

There was also a French word I had seen but had no idea what it meant, so that clue was very useless to me, and there were an annoying number of, ‚ÄúWhat inane phrase is clued by this other inane phrase?‚Äù

All in all, I don‚Äôt think it was a bad puzzle, but it‚Äôs definitely the first Saturday in a while where I felt like I had no hope of getting it on my own. Just too many random bits of trivia I would have had to look up to have any shot.",31,negative,0.784984827041626
"That SW corner was nasty. Spent ten minutes on it and still had a bunch of mistakes. I knew MAHERSHALAALI off the bat but not how to spell it. Mixed up the ZEKE crossing with ZaKE or maybe I had ZiKE. Missed BARRE and thought the crossings were NsA and DELi, both of which fit the clue, but of course sARRi is not a thing. Tough puzzlr",6,negative,0.8917596936225891

"This was an ideal puzzle for me.  It felt challenging, with lots of misdirections, especially alley oops for SEVENTENSPLIT (got hung up trying to find a basketball answer), but was over surprisingly quickly.  Knowing TAMEIMPALA, HAIRMETAL, and Dua LIPA helped immeasurably. Also, I don‚Äôt usually get long acrosses without at least a couple of crosses, but this time I guessed WPAMURALS and MAHERSHALAALI right off the bat.  I I liked the clue for NBA.",12,positive,0.898952841758728
"I had some difficulty at first with the northeast corner, then it clicked, and I got my fastest Friday solve. And, no gimmicks. Yeah.",7,positive,0.7441051006317139
Good puzzle.  Hard at first then came together smoothly.  Then...took me five minutes to find that friggin' Z.,9,positive,0.9196010231971741
"That was a fairly smooth solve--looked daunting at first, but then it solved smoothly. Lots of fun stuff in there, and the things I didn't know (Tame IMPALA?) were crossed with things that I did know.",13,positive,0.9506300687789917
