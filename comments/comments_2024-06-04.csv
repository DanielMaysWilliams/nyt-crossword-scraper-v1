I was raised to think ‚Äúbusiness attire‚Äù is the clue for SUIT.

He was, as usual, wearing a belt and suspenders. Mind you, he had a few things for dressy occasions but the pants were never of the same fabric, as in a SUIT.

Early innings went  pretty well, but then the opponents (The Montgomery Biscuits) started getting hits and homers.  The coach kept taking out the M-Braves pitcher and putting in a fresh one...and the hits just kept coming.  Final score:  13-5  Biscuits.  Maybe the M-Braves will do better on the road against The Trash Pandas....

"Well, Daniel Bodily is doing something right, with nine NYT puzzles published in a bit over two years.  Part of it is his ability to come up with entertaining themes. Jeff Chen, who has collaborated with him on three puzzles, lauds Daniel‚Äôs ability to ‚Äútheme-storm‚Äù.

I loved today‚Äôs theme because, just like yesterday‚Äôs, it provided an extra solving challenge ‚Äì figuring out the revealer before uncovering it.  I‚Äôm bad at this, so I work extra hard to get better at it.  Yesterday, I didn‚Äôt correctly guess the revealer but I did find the BOARD connection between the theme answers.  That was a huge woo-hoo for me.

Today, once again, I didn‚Äôt guess the reveal verbatim, but I did see the connection in the theme answers, that they were things not to touch.  Well, holy moly!  My small steps are inching toward medium steps!

Jeff Chen also said that Daniel‚Äôs prime aim is to ‚Äúserve the solver‚Äù.  That is, he‚Äôs looking to entertain, to provide a terrific riddle to crack ‚Äì not trying to show off.
