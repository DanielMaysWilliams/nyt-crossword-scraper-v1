"This was quite a nice puzzle with a fun theme, even though I only knew the Lady Gaga lyrics, and I did not remember them at first, either. The unknown lyrics were easy to figure out though once I had some crosses.

As almost always, some trivia got me and I had to look it up, especially in the naticky crossing of DEAF and GIFS: naticky because I had no idea what CODA was - you Americans you and your pathological love of acronyms! - and I've never heard of Slack, so it was a cruel way to clue my beloved GIFS (I've had entire conversations consisting solely of gifs, but on Signal, the non-spying IM app). I also had to Google PIERRE (I have never read War and Peace, which is on me I guess; my mom loved 19th century Russian literature, but she always told me one has to read it in Russian to fully appreciate it, and since I never learned that language, I passed on the books; I knew from experience how much English literature lost in translation and figured the same was true of Russian) and ADWEEK (are we really supposed to know the titles of trade mags?).

Those alternating O‚Äôs and A‚Äôs in the NW probably cost me 5 minutes of extra solve time to notice and fix. I‚Äôd blown through the horizontal fill in the NW so quickly I didn‚Äôt even notice the vertical fill was busted (MOOT, ERO) ‚Äî at a glance they seemed like plausible solves to *something*.",10,positive,0.870110809803009

I did have one problem in the NE, that being only familiar with the musical coda, but the crosses helped there.

"Oh yeah. Super cool puzzle. Loved everything about it. Thanks, Daniel Mauer!

So far, each puzzle this week has been the perfect difficulty for the day, in my opinion. 

Got me thinking. What is my perfect difficulty in terms of ideal solve time? Never really thought about this, so going to think out loud a bit, here. 

Monday: 5-10
Tuesday: 8-15
Wednesday: 15-25
Thursday: 20-40
Friday: 30-50
Saturday: 40-60
Sunday: 45-75

I think these are pretty ideal numbers for me, personally. 

Anything much under and either I felt especially sharp / on the same wave length as the constructor(stoked!). OR the puzzle just felt a bit too easy (less stoked). 

Anything much over these times can often (but not always) feel like a slog, for me. Especially a really tough Sunday. And the worst is when I finish a puzzle around the target time and then spend twice as long fly specking! Always made worse when I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm looking for one square that‚Äôs off, or two, or three. (Or five!)",19,positive,0.9436144828796387
"What a contrast in constructor experiences: Mauer has this idea for repeated syllables in songs, the grid comes together in a day, he sends it off and Bob's your uncle, even with the LOLOLOLO chchchchanges the editors reworked as LALALALA. But in the last few days the Daring Duo submitted 122 puzzles before they finally hit paydirt and the Sunday puzzle took nearly 2 dozen versions before everyone was satisfied. Now I'm not the world's most intellectual guy, if I got rejected 50 times I'd be tempted to die, get out your vee-OLA, make a SUB with capicola, C-O-L-A cola...

So glad Pierre was clued with War and Peace. What a character, lumpy, big and oafish, propelled more by his heart than by his head, forever getting into trouble because of his impulsiveness, but well meaning, spiritually a searcher, and not stupid. It's only when he finally, luckily, gets it right in his love life that his life begins to make sense to him, and all this against the backdrop of late Czarist Russia and parts of western Europe as he seeks his fortune (and then becomes blessed with enormous wealth, which causes no end of problems). It's no accident that Dune, the bildungsroman of my gggggeneration, makes an appearance, too. Paul Atreides must also confront inheriting enormous wealth and power, and his spiritual journey like Pierre's, is the backbone of the book. How I do go on. We won't ask what ANI (Skywalker) is doing here!

It's true that a musical theme will always make me smile, but I'm very impressed with this one wherein all songs stutter exactly four times. What a find! 

What offers worldwide protection? I only had the E and was tempted to write in peacE.

"The problem with 'technically correct' answers, especially when it comes to well-known song lyrics, is they end up being confusing to solvers. Almost everybody thinks the song goes, ""Lo-lo-lo-lo- Lola,"" so they're going to write in that way at first and be confused when that doesn't work with the crossings.

Great performer, love her!

As for the puzzle, it was fun, and I got a little stuck on GIFS/CODA, so had to look that up.  It was interesting to read about the famous CODAs in history--I didn't know much about this and appreciated learning about it.
