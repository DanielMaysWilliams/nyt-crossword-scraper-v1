// I loved how the adjacencies of the theme pairs were reinforced -- to my eye -- with others. Especially OOHS over PASSIONS, but also HOT SALSA with a nice SIRLOIN strip STEAK. And then there are CURL and SALON; BALE and SILO; the Mets' SHEA Stadium and NO HIT... Or SHEA butter and ALOE vera.

"Hah!  I loved this theme.  I especially loved the paired theme answers in the east, south, and west, where the long phrases directionally describe the one-word partner on the edge of the grid, and yet those long phrases also stand alone with a meaning that has nothing to do with that one-word partner.

That is, say, BOTTOM LINE by itself refers to the gist of something or to something financial, and nowhere does it suggest METRO.

Well, that is some first-class ‚ÄúHah!‚Äù-inducing wordplay, and to have it happen three times in a grid brought me great pleasure.  

The exception, of course, was TOP SIRLOIN, which does suggest STEAK.  There are those who would say that this exception makes the theme inelegant.  But I, who tend to see the glass half full, am grateful for the pleasure I‚Äôve triply received. 

I also had the pleasure of learning about two things.  One, YABBER, which looks and sounds terrific, and I hope to get it in my rotation.  And two, the song ‚ÄúVideo Killed the Radio Star‚Äù, which never rose above #40 in the U.S., but was number one an many other countries, and whose video was the first video ever played on MTV.  Truly, the Wikipedia article on the song plunged me into a fascinating world, and I highly recommend it.

"I guess people don't like having to change a word in their puzzle.  I thought YAmmER at first, but since LEFT mEHIND and mALLER clearly looked wrong, I went with YABBER, which sounded familiar and is, in fact, a word.  Now, that wasn't so difficult.  What's the fuss?
