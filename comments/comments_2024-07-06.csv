"This one was tough! One of the most difficult in my recent memory. All sorts of vague clues, very clever misdirects and near-naticks. Had I tried to work out this one on a printed copy my erasures might have worn holes in the paper.

Finally filled in all the squares after two hours with a few breaks, but only got the ""close but not quite"" result. Went over the grid repeatedly looking for a typo or other mistake. Finally decided to try ZETAS instead of BETAS, and got the happy music. I'd had no idea of the crossing author's name and had been satisfied with FRAN BEN, as awkward a name as that sounds.

Well, I'm on a few meds right now that are leaving me a little lightheaded, so I'll be happy to tell myself that some of my difficulties were due to that condition, in hopes of preserving my self-esteem.",4,negative,0.4816177487373352

"This one was fairly tough for me. The southeast came pretty easily but after that I had some trouble. I am proud of getting DON DRAPER from only the clue and the PER from crossings. I've never watched a single minute of the show, so that was kind of fun.

The northwest came next, helped by pretty immediately putting in ARE WE OKAY and TARMAC. Although I'm not a big one for sports questions, I usually know football because I used to be a big Packers fan (I don't think there's a lot of *former* Packers fans out there but I've become a bit anti-NFL, in general). Anyhow, I could not think of anything football related that would fit so I immediately thought of other touchdowns. I slowly worked through the middle, but the northeast and southwest were killer for me and because I really had to shove off soon, I broke and did one look up in each, for FRANZEN and RILEY. Having eight for so long in the southwest was certainly a barrier, as was swerve instead of ONE TWO in the ne. Ah well!

My thoughts, none of which would pan out, were: ""Wow"" for 36A (OMG was correct),for 55A I tried Eight, InTen, and Dozen but not helped me out (Octet was correct).  I could only come up with Craved for 46A (longed was correct).  For 60A Fools, Asses, and Goofs came to mind but didn't help me (dodos was coorect).   For 41A I presumed it was something that ended in an ""s"" link ""ends"", but never came up with anything good (fora was correct).

"As long as I can escape with a Saturday Times puzzle, there’s usually no reason to despair over the state of the world, but today’s inner grid is a veritable heart of darkness. We have WEIMARERA stacked over DEPRAVITY, with COWTIPPER to the NW and DONDRAPER to the SE. Is Evans Clinchy trying to tell us something -- like there’s no refuge?  Love, pace the Mad Man, may be real, but here it’s love in lockdown (Garcia Marquez’s AMOR), unfulfilled (49A; LONGED), or in urgent need of consummation (54A: PDA).
  
This is the first I’ve seen or heard of COWTIPPER. My first guess for 25A was LOWTIPPER. I imagined that “bulldozing” must be waitpersons’ slang for being dissed by customers, an expression that would have started in Soho or Williamsburg and gone viral. Wikipedia says that cowtipping is a so-called “urban legend” – which in this case could be a city person’s idea of how some folks in the hinterland amuse themselves. So the center of the grid isn’t all noir, but includes 
some timely red and blue.

For me, the really tough parts of this puzzle were the NE and SW quadrants. Once I let go of MORMANS for 12D and ALGERIA for 37D, everything came together pretty fast.",5,negative,0.5273886919021606

Then he sat down in a chair and stared at the board for about ten minutes.  Then he walked out of the class and went to his office where he proceeded to scribble furiously at his desk.

"A wonderful themeless -- with most of the difficulty derived from vague or misleading cluing rather than from arcane trivia.  And where there were proper names, they were mostly from my era and/or within my sphere of interest and knowledge:  ELLA; PARTON; DON DRAPER. (Delightful clue for DON DRAPER!  If you never watched ""Mad Men"", watch it now, for heaven's sake!)

But some of the names from my era had vanished from my brain in a sea of Senioritis.  I had the EN, knew he was a Jonathan, and thought his last name was maybe...FReiZEN?

Until I got FORA, I couldn't come up with ANGELO.

Interesting that the one thing my aging, fuzzy brain didn't forget today was something I only know from a previous crossword puzzle.  COW TIPPING.  I'm not sure what it is, exactly, but it's such a funny image and such a NOVELTY that my always-forgetful brain refused to forget it.

FLU SEASON was clued in a way that could have been a technology Beta launch.  EASY FIXES was clued in a way that it would have been some sort of bASe mIX.  The cluing was devious and a lot of thought obviously went into it.  Thought this was a terrific Saturday.",23,positive,0.7773534655570984

Every single one of them, except maybe COW TIPPER, is so in the language, IMO, and all of them, to me, have an interesting ring, verve.  All of them make me wonder, “How can this answer not have appeared in a Times puzzle before?”  

Freshness abounding, then, in this puzzle, especially in that center stairstep stack, containing four debuts and one answer that has appeared but once before in the Times.  Wow!

Freshness like this, to me, is not a constructor showing off.  It’s a constructor exhibiting skill, as good debut answers are not easy to come by.  It’s a constructor focused on entertaining the solver through answers and clues never seen before in the NYT puzzle.

The solving enjoyment, for me, was padded by sweet wordplay misdirects, such as [Meeting places] for FORA and [Run slowly] for SEEP.

Despite living in Iowa, which I would presume is prime - pardon the pun - COW TIPPING country, I'm sad to say I've never met someone who has actually done this.

"Hanging out with Joey and Chris back when we were all 17 was a riot. They were country boys from Greene County, PA, filled with mischief and mayhem. A day spent in their company might involve digging for arrowheads, swimming in a rain-filled abandoned quarry, crash-sailing down a steep hillock in Chris's homemade hang-glider, smoking jimson weed (headache, intestinal issues) in the ruins of an early 19th century stone blast furnace on Roberts Run a little north of Spraggs, trying to get attacked by a gang of peahens and peacocks this old couple in Carmichaels raised. But one time they came back from a weekend at home and bragged about going cow tipping all night. It was the first I heard the term. 

They said most livestock sleeps standing up in the fields and you could sneak up and give 'em a push, they'd teeter and totter and then crash, still asleep, to the ground. They said it was like causing the demolition of a large building, the thunderous noice of it, the brutes startled awake, bruised and enraged, snorting and lowing, struggling to get up; and the danger to the cow-tipper was heady and addictive: they were enormous, blind with rage, they could give chase, as could the farmers. 

To me it was utter moral depravity, demonstrating a lack of basic empathy. Our friendship cooled, ended.

And Caitlin,  I don't know if the clue for Ms. PARTON is that deep a cut.  It was well covered in the media, and our very own NY Times had an article linking to many of the songs so you could listen to them.",8,positive,0.9181045293807983

"Loved the stacks - 2 x 3 x 7 , 2 x 3 x 8 and 1 x 5 x 9 .  Some great clues - loved 10A bar / butcher order.  I had 'bozos' for nitwits for far too long.  I enjoyed this, which went a bit more quickly than typical Saturday puzzles.",10,positive,0.9800492525100708
"Of DON DRAPER, Caitlin wrote, “It’s interesting how certain fictional figures remain instantly recognizable.”

That’s true even if you’ve never seen a minute of “Mad Men.” I knew the answer from the O of DOLLY PARTON and the A of ATTA, both of which were gimmes.

That made up for my temporary inability to summon Pat RILEY’s surname. I knew who the clue referred to and could picture him from some commercial (Rolaids, maybe), but it took a minute to remember his name. 

It doesn’t make up for my failure to get AMOR without any crosses. The only Gabriel García Márquez title I know is “Love in the Time of Cholera,” and I wish I had spent half a second thinking about what “Tiempos del Cólera” means instead of skipping over it. 

Smushed together, WEIMAR ERA is hard to parse, but it amused me to see it on top of DEPRAVITY (a great word that I don’t recall ever seeing in a crossword before).

And now I know that Algeria and MOROCCO have the same number of letters. 

Nice if not particularly challenging Saturday. Thanks, Mr. Clinchy!",23,neutral,0.6769552230834961
"I swear to God there's a kink in the time/space continuum somewhere: how else can it be that I floundered and sweated over this puzzle, especially the NW and the center, and still took 7 minutes off my Saturday average? 

I can say now that I liked it, but I would have snarled had you asked me during it.",16,negative,0.7661402821540833
"So many false starts today.

"Well made puzzle.  With some nice misdirections - I had ""stud"" for poker game and ""eight"" for hot dog buns until those became untenable.  Plus I initially decided ""FLy SEASON"" must be a thing.",12,positive,0.8086130619049072
Too easy for a Saturday.,6,neutral,0.4647960364818573
"I steadily filled in more of the puzzle with each pass until I was left only with a mostly empty NE corner. RILEY was a gimme, but I just wasn't on the same wavelength as the constructor on the rest.

SYN was glaringly bad fill. OTOH, the cluing for AMOR was the best I've seen.",9,negative,0.5114365220069885
