About 20 years ago, 
we pulled our boys out of school 
at Christmastime, 
rented a Winnebago
and cruised the country for four months.

One very rainy night, 
we were heading into San Antonio
and decided to get a hotel room.

I had a cell phone and called at least 10 hotels-
all fully booked.
No room at the inn(s)!

Finally, we got one.
Almost $400 for the night, but
we needed a room.
It was late.

It was stunning and we tucked the boys in,
and all fell asleep on Egyptian cotton clouds.

Woke at dawn a few hours later to bombs going off! 
Repeatedly!!
We all ran to the windows and looked out.

We had rented a corner room directly overlooking 
The Alamo.
On March 5th.
So we woke up on‚Ä¶March 6th.

We had very expensive front-row seats
to the reenactment.
So, there was the boys ‚Äúhome-schooling‚Äù for the day.

shooting each other and falling down dead

My other peeve was ""ahoy"" as I had been trained that Bell wanted ""ahoy ahoy"".  But a pleasurable little rabbit hole after finishing the puzzle led me to inconsistent reports, including that he actually wanted and used ""ahoy hoy"".

Even more fascinating, apparently the word ""hello"" didn't EXIST until the mid-1800s, and was popularized when Edison championed it for phone use.

THE SHOW MUST GO ON.

One editor told me that stream of consciousness was out of favor and cited ""Oxford rules,"" and I complied because he was the

COMMANDER IN CHIEF.

Once I had a job hand-printing poetry broadsides. The editor came in one day and got so enraged at something I was doing wrong that he upended the plate and threw it all over the room. I asked him to stop

TYPE CASTING me.

And recently I posted something here and it never saw the light of day. And that editor was wrong, it was probably the best thing I ever wrote. But I saw it as a ceremonial cleansing, the definition of 

EMUNDATION.

Anyhoo, the puzzle was fun, all too quick, and caused me to recall old interactions with some of my favorite editors. I liked the earlap/batlike duo, learned something new about Florence, and the clue about Rome caused me to wonder how many countries entirely surround other countries. I can come up with Lesotho. Any others?",28,neutral,0.5086073875427246
Fast and fun.  Kept expecting a rebus or some trick  on the first pass through.  Finished in about half my usual Thursday time.,6,positive,0.9573188424110413
earLap got me good. Still trying to make Led make sense. But I‚Äôll try not to let it keep me up.,5,positive,0.7701514959335327
"Expectations get in the way of a good time sometimes ... I missed having the usual Thursday puzzle-within-a-puzzle challenge, but putting that expectation aside it was still fun and fun to solve.",7,positive,0.7519320249557495
"This was a great Wednesday puzzle!  (Pity it was published on Thursday.)

I loved CAT SAT because I've seen ""ANTED"" so many times.  I actually looked at it and thought ""It would be really cool to make a puzzle with CAT SAT instead of ANTED.  Oh, wait...""",12,positive,0.9701505899429321
"12 minutes on the timer. 36 minutes on the clock, though, since I did it in between pitches/innings of the Mets games...",1,neutral,0.9160358309745789
"This was no Thursday!! And why are we getting themes on Thursday, which make the clueing so much easier? This was Tuesday level difficulty at best. 

The punny theme entries were cute but I did not find much punny about the revealer itself (would‚Äôve been punnier if ALTERATION ALTERCATION were to be answer somehow).",3,negative,0.7804336547851562
"Fun puzzle. Some tricky clues.
Yes Deb, I found out that ""anted"" didn't work too...",8,neutral,0.4748935103416443
Not a bad little puzzle but prefer the gimmicky ones on Thursday,10,neutral,0.4578123688697815
"August I think this puzzle was brilliant! Very clever theme, and crisp cluing. I look forward to more like this!",18,positive,0.9880692362785339
"The garbage goes out tonight here, so it must be Wednesday night, which means that there‚Äôs supposed to be a Thursday puzzle at 10:00. What‚Äôs happened to my Thursday puzzle?",16,negative,0.6472721099853516
"Nice theme and good fill, again. But this was far too easy for a Thursday. It was more like a Tuesday level of difficulty. 

The editors need to do better at, well, editing.",17,negative,0.35569125413894653
