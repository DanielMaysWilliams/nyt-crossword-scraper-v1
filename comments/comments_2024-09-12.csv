"Nice puzzle!  Top right corner got to me.  Although xxASKAROLL, I should have gotten it!

Just picking a nit - SPAYING and NEUTERING are two different things (the former is performed on females, the latter on males).

Sometimes it's abbreviated SPEUTERING in the animal rescue community when we're talking about the general practice in the context of reducing births to avoid overpopulation which results in healthy animals being killed in shelters - which by the way is at epidemic levels right now.  So if you have room in your home to foster a dog or cat even for a little while, contact a local non-profit rescue groups and volunteer.  They will pay all the medical bills, most will pay for food, and you'll be saving a life!  Rescue groups  usually don't have brick and mortar facilities, so they can't pull animals from shelters without foster homes ready to take them.  The rescue group will take back the foster animal if you cannot keep it until it is adopted.",6,positive,0.8555522561073303

Cluing for Botox, NFL, and Lab Report was all quite clever.  Peek was good too.

"Random thoughts: 
‚Ä¢ Fantastic theme concept.  Bravo to Parker for pulling this out of the ether.  It‚Äôs a two-level theme, first coming up with ‚ÄúA and B‚Äù phrases, then finding lively phrases that use the A word.  Try coming up with something like this on your own sometime!
‚Ä¢ Nice to see ELOPE abutting LIFE PARTNER.
‚Ä¢ For me, lovely mix of areas that splat-filled and others I had to return to.
‚Ä¢ Fun to try to figure out the theme answers with few or no crosses, after cracking the gimmick. 
‚Ä¢ MAYOR crossing AMORAL elicited the word MAYORAL; and IN BAD crossing EMBED elicited IN BED.
‚Ä¢ In a past note, Parker said he liked putting in words with unusual letter combinations.  Today, I‚Äôm thinking it was the BS start of BSIDE.  Oh, there are other answers that start this way (i.e., BSHARP, BSTUDENT, BSDEGREE), but not many.
‚Ä¢ A trove of smile-producing clues; I especially liked [It might cause some unsurprised looks] for BOTOX.
‚Ä¢ Loved OTAKU because I didn‚Äôt know it, thus it was satisfying to correctly fill in, not to mention that it looks cool, and is worth remembering.

"Easier than the Weds imo, still pretty fresh though the ""theme"" clues were pretty unsatisfying. Gonna go ask my pup what he thinks",9,neutral,0.5280429124832153
"PETS just seems a little odd to me. You can pet your pet, but you don‚Äôt really give him a pet. You give him a pat. Maybe literally correct but it‚Äôs just not something anyone would say, especially since PAT is an option and there are lots of better clues imho",27,negative,0.6722177863121033
Lab report may be my favorite clue ever!,51,positive,0.9805011749267578

"Parker, you had me at ‚ÄúFathoms‚Äù - the soundtrack to The Little Mermaid was also a soundtrack to my childhood. I can‚Äôt count the number of times I listened and sang/danced along to that tape as a kid in my bedroom. 

Loved all the musical references and the unexpected misdirections. I was also excited to almost match my Thursday best time. Thanks to Deb for explaining the theme and how the clues usually work; as often happens, I sort of got it from doing the puzzle, but I appreciate the wordplay and puzzle design a lot more after reading the column.",9,positive,0.9646486639976501

"Just FYI: The Alt key is on Macs. It‚Äôs mainly called the Option key(s) but it is also called Alt.

"Quick and easy thursday. Took a few clicks for the theme to click and looked at the column for some clever clues. Yet to see an inside-out alaska roll in all the years of eating sushi in many states and countries though - but remember seeing it here before, must be the same constructor",4,positive,0.5962464809417725
"I wasn‚Äôt quite as alacritous on this one as I normally am.  In fact, I only got SPEEDY via the crosses and then, after the fact, caught the relation to alacrity.  I think I‚Äôll start using it. Lots of other interesting clues and a theme that I didn‚Äôt pick up on.  All in all an interesting Wednesday.

I enjoyed seeing Mumford and SONS pop up in the puzzle.  Their debut album was a revelation, featuring emotionally intense songs with surprising bluegrassy codas.  Subsequently Marcus Mumford has become sort of an English T-Bone Burnett, popping as a producer on lots of other people‚Äôs music and acting as music director for tv shows and movies.",8,positive,0.812750518321991
