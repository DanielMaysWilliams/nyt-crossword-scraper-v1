"Fun puzzle!!

I didn't encounter some of the issues that others had. But I held on to kale for the salad in the NE until I had nowhere else to go. The entire block was blank except for that (sorry, hateful) salad base. Oh, and cask for the Scotch! They use casks to age and thus flavor, amirite? Fit neatly with the K... 

Once I ripped out the greens and the wood, PEAT leading to TUNA was a revelation! I happen to love tuna salad!! 

I know, this post does not show my diet in a very good light-! Everything in moderation... And there are loads of dark leafy veggies I crave that more than compensate for kale.

Speaking of kale, I do love the Italian name for it: nero cavolo. Just like I loved the Italian references scattered throughout this puzzle! Phew, managed to pull it back around to the game at hand before signing off!

"Question for others.  

I play the puzzle online using a Chrome browser.  Just the standard fill in the squares.

I have noticed in the past that if I leave off a puzzle, and then come back to it, sometimes the puzzle has apparently lost the connection to the NYT servers, as it doesn't responds at all (either happy music or sad announcement) when I finish.

So I refresh the page.  When I do, a lot of things I filled in are missing.  So I assume it never got uploaded to the server.

Today I had that problem in spades.  I'd enter a letter, get no response, try again, and again, and then I'd refresh and a lot of my edits were gone, reverted to what it was before.

Has anyone else notices this?  Is there a fix for it?  I'm guessing not.",0,neutral,0.5904470682144165

TIL: that CAP is slang for ""lie"" and is most commonly used in the phrase ""no CAP"" to emphasize that one is giving their honest opinion.
That was the easy part of that corner, since it allowed me to put in SCORES for the ""level best.""
But putting in the (obvious?) SELeNA for VP Meyer's first name, and the (obvious?) wOW for ""expression of shock"", left me with weGHSCORES for ""level best"".

There are other odd choices and I'M SO CONFUSED.  As an EARLY SIGN of spring I want to see robins.  Or crocuses.  Or cherry blossoms.  I do NOT want to see snowdrops.  Snowdrops are the last things I want to see.

HOW is an expression of shock?  How so?  I wanted wOW, but couldn't make weGH at 55A work.  (I also had SELeNA).

I saw in some of the early comments that there was a little confusion over snowdrops. It would seem it’s not a native flower across the US. What a treat you miss; tiny, fragile white bells that emerge from the dark and cold, or frankly in recent years, more like the wet, in February, finally heralding the onset of Spring.

Apparently I don't know the latest term for LIE, which is too bad, since there is quite a bit of that going around.  

Some of this came easily despite the trickiness of the clues, but then remembering Ms. May's first name was difficult, not to mention the ""Scale fourths"" (going to keep rubbing that in, are we?)...  

The 'dawn chorus' usually includes spring peepers (FROG?) and all manner of bird life--so that was quite a challenge.

Aaaand ""The North Shore"".....  In the Fifties, we called it 'The Nort Point,' and it was undeveloped, unpaved, and sparsely visited.  You could look at the tide pools, watch the waves, have a picnic, and lose your fishing tackle... There was even rusted barbed wire about--part of the defenses in case of an invasion.

Unlike others, I didn't find this to be a ""fun"" puzzle while I was slaving over it, except for ""Evidence of a past personal connection?""

Highlights:
• The NYT debut answers today: ACCENT WALL, EARLY SIGN, I’M SO CONFUSED, POWER USERS, and even that goofy SMELLERS, which made me smile.
• The grid design, which made space for that unusually high number of long answers (eight letters or more).
• The skill of quilting this many long answers together without creating an overflow of detritus.
• Sweet cluing, highlighted by those never-used-before clues for NAVEL and WEREWOLF.
• Enough bite to satisfy my brain’s work ethic; enough give to enable the thrill of several answer splashes.

And all this, Jesse, on your NYT debut, which felt more like it came from the hand of a seasoned constructor than from one who’s been at it for a bit more than two years.

But anyone who thinks that genocide in the pursuit of *Lebensraum* is anything new, or exclusively European, should read up on the Iroquois Wars.

OK, I have to confess that I find this recording--of a familiar ditty by J. S. Bach--a little creepy, but it does feature a LEGATO line for the TREBLEs, and it's been transposed into F major, so it features plenty of FAS, in both Fixed-Do and Moveable-Do solfege systems:

NE slowed me down for a minute, but it was a

get a couple crosses,
spanners “appeared”,

Years ago, I was whining to my partner about something at work - some scenario where others were stubbornly refusing to accept my obviously correct view of something, heh.
He told me what he uses in those situations is “I’m confused”. It allows you to air your thoughts and maybe avoid the tripwire of defensiveness in your listener.

IT's an EARLYSIGN with his  great debut
Oh, Jesse keep on cluing' please
Until your grid fills up
Until your grid fills up

My STREETSMARTS
Don't LYE and they talk to me.
They told me
ABOVEALL, this grid wins a top AWARD from me.
And I'm sure he meant well
Yeah, but when his grid was through
I, I, I said Jesse if you only knew
Most Thursday's folk say IMSOCONFUSED
Jesse keep on cluin' me

"This one was so hard for me that every time I filled in a corner I expected a knock on the door by a Nobel Committee rep ready to hand me a gold star and a fistful of dollars.  The only thing that saved it was that it was so much fun to solve, with so many unexpected quirky clues.  ""Evidence of a past personal connection?"" It doesn't get any better than that.

Jesse Cohn, you may have had some first class help, but in end the puzzle was all yours. Without your resourcefulness and persistence if would never have happened.  Congratulations  on your debut and thank you! (Now how about an encore?)",32,positive,0.8041970133781433
"Lots of personality. Tickled the mind. Stuff I got a kick out of:

- Etta without James. Finally!
- the ironic crossings of Street Smarts with I've Been Had! & I'm So Confused with Safe Bets. Good life hacks, in other words: those who think they're wise in the ways of the world are more naive than they think; those who are confused can still make wise choices.
- The Italian trio of Roma, Trieste and the aforementioned Etta.
- Speaking of which, can I take BART to go OVER TRAIN to the North Beach for the bruschETTA at Tosca Café? I heard it's all the rage. If I was a power user of the internet I'd know the answer.
- Accent Wall - Waste Paper. Same difference as they say!
- Werewolf - Snapchat. You might say any conversation with a werewolf will result in a snap chat; they're not so much snapping at you as snapping on you. In fact the movie ""Ginger Snaps"" is about two teenaged female werewolves.
- Also liked that werewolf was neutrally gendered in the clue. I do tend to think of them as male, but am informed by power users that there are plenty of films with lycanthropic females, including Rob Zombie's Werewolf Women of the SS, Wolves, Cursed, Blood & Chocolate, and the list goes on...
- Loved Ahab's quote for its misdirect. He's so confused! Does he think he's going OVER TRAIN to catch the whale? Dude's on a BOAT! 
- And if I was an ET and wasn't yet street smart, I'd also call noses ""smellers"" until someone clued me in. 
- ABOVE ALL I like to fill in END before I fill BEGIN.",19,positive,0.7680979371070862
"Spent a good 5 minutes fly specking an otherwise fast and fun Friday. My problems were in the Northwest. 

ROMA (not ROMe)
and
LEGATO (not LaGATO)

Kudos and congrats, Jesse Cohn!",8,positive,0.9191156029701233
"Jesse Cohn, your debut was my favorite to solve in recent memory, thank you!

Clever clues, fresh fill, no Natick = perfect puzzle!",5,positive,0.9795894026756287
"Nice puzzle.  This had me worried at first but it all came together working up and out of the SW.   Half my Friday average, even wasting five minutes hunting for the error in ROME/ETTE.  Had also never heard the slang for 'lie' but the crosses were solid.",5,positive,0.8688421845436096
"I would sing higher notes, but then I'd get into treble.

(Just pitch this one.)",38,neutral,0.7543195486068726
"Great debut, Jesse!  How lucky for us that your bucket list included constructing an NYT puzzle. Very clever clues, but the WEREWOLF clue was my favorite.",9,positive,0.9878346920013428
"New best time for me on this one, to go with my new best Monday time from the start of this week.
Fun to see improving over time (assuming that's the reason and the puzzles aren't just getting easier...)",5,positive,0.9720500111579895
"Congratulations on your NYT Deb, Mr. Cohn!

I enjoyed many of the clues, especially the ones for WEREWOLF and NAVEL.

I hope we’ll see you back here soon.",18,positive,0.9813323020935059
"Good thing to have in the city:
I was thinking, WHAT THE HEY, HOW about a penthouse, looming ABOVE ALL, with views far and wide, and INTERNET of course, but more importantly, an ACCENT WALL that's ALL THE RAGE.

Okay, back to earth.
Congratulations on a beautiful debut, Mr. Cohn!
It was clever and fun, with smart misdirects. 
A joy to solve!

One more thing – now that you've crossed this off your bucket list, don't forget to add a replacement. 
If you keep a running list, you'll always need more time 'round these parts, ultimately giving you a very, very long life!  ;-)",10,positive,0.8408627510070801
"Deb, interesting that you read 46D to mean “STRIP off one’s clothes” - I just assumed it meant STRIP the threads from a screw.  Nice double meaning for that clue!",50,positive,0.6093473434448242
"Excellent wordplay, fresh entries, outstanding triple stacks.  

Congratulations, Jesse. A most impressive debut.",8,positive,0.9836426973342896
"I really enjoyed this one. Lots of entertaining and clever clues and not a lot of obscure or archaic trivia. The ""moonshine"" clue was excellent fun, as was the ""negative impression"" clue. ""Evidence of a past, personal connection"" also made me giggle. 

Just the right level of challenge and fun for a Friday puzzle!",33,positive,0.9734925627708435
"Now that's exactly what I expect out of a Friday puzzle. A lot of tough and non obvious clues, but they all made sense after solving. Took a while to grind it out, but it was steady grind. 30 minutes, no mistakes",11,positive,0.7576197385787964
"Tough, but fair in the end.  Upper right and lower left gave me some trouble.

I never would have guessed it was a first time effort.

Nice work.",20,positive,0.6874024868011475
"@Deb. An alternative explanation for 46 D   Bolts (as in nuts and…) are said to be STRIPped when they lose their threads. This was my first thought, rather like yours better.",9,neutral,0.72874915599823
What an excellent Friday puzzle!,6,positive,0.9812260866165161
Fastest Friday for me yet! I was really locked in on the long ones in this puzzle,5,positive,0.9674912691116333

I liked this one and it was also my record time for solving a Friday!,14,positive,0.98488450050354
I was not so confused.  A very quick solve for me.  Sometimes it is in the wheelhouse.  I usually struggle with Friday's more then Saturday's.,7,neutral,0.5538157820701599
