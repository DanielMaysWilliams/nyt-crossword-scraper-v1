"I'm not calling fowl or anything, but I might have preferred SMALL ARMS to be clued as a feature of T-rex and kangaroos.

Back to SMALL ARMS, funnily enough, it was placed perfectly near to NAAN-violence, which, once I got, I quacked up about. 

I'm quite taken with Peshwari NAAN, but NAAN-violence might just be my new favorite!  I should have gotten that one sooner but, like MOL said earlier, I don't think of it as an app and so I got distracted thinking about what I do acknowledge as Indian apps. Mm! It was worth the wait!

Loads of fun in this one! Favorites include: ARMOIRES for drawers with drawers, DUCKS IN A ROW, SPIDER WEB, FLAT EARTHER, SSN (who'da thunk SSN would ever be a favorite!?), and NAUSEA. Also the inclusion of RUBBER ducks as a species.

I actually have a rubber ducky. He came from a work trip to the Peabody Hotel in Memphis‚Äîwhere their ducks put on quite the parade! If I recall correctly, they started in a row but once arriving at the big fountain, it was not so much the case.

"Loved this. I thought I was looking for colours when I got teal in the circles. All soon became clear with mallards. Having a rubber ducky in there was the icing on the cake.

WESSEX: while the clue is technically correct in naming it an ancient region and you won‚Äôt find it marked on any modern maps, it is still alive and kicking.  It‚Äôs comprised of the counties of Somerset and Avon (where I live) and Dorset. The Somerset Levels, of which the magical area of Glastonbury is the chief town, is the once marshland where Alfred hid from the Danes. It‚Äôs reclaimed land now but still floods during wet weather. The name Somerset derives from the old English ‚Äòsummer‚Äôs people‚Äô, so named because they needed to move community and animals to higher ground in winter to avoid the floods.

And the theme is playful and adorable too.  I picked it up at MALLARD with its wayward ""D"".  What an interesting and unusual idea for a theme!  Who thinks of such a thing?

"Today, the day before the 80th anniversary of D-Day, is an apt time to have HEDGEROW in the puzzle. 

A fair amount of the territory inland of the Normandy landings was agricultural, including dairy country where the fields were separated by hedgerows. German soldiers used them as camouflage, hiding in them to snipe at the advancing Allied forces. 

The cows who lived in those fields, however, were not accustomed to having men in their hedgerows, and were quite curious about them. They tended to gather at the spots where the snipers were hidden, investigating. 

This was a great help to the Allied soldiers, as it tipped off both the presence and the location of the Germans.

"This puzzle went in smooth as a duckbill hairstyle. (Okay, I may be stretching the analogy a little too far!) I don't look at my stats any more, but it may have been a PB; nary a pause nor a ponder from beginning to end.

That SPIDER WEB clue is a gem! I also loved FLAT-EARTHER and LANDLUBBERS together in a grid. With apologies to any solvers of the latter persuasion: In my (coastal) world, these two types somehow resonate on the same *wavelength*.  ;)
