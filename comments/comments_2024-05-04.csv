Including RILKE and WABI SABI in the puzzle gave it a certain aura that nicely balanced out the in-the-language spanners.

I've loved the concept of WABI SABI ever since first learning about it years ago. Applied to life itself, and not just to aesthetics, acceptance of the little imperfections casts a spell of grace.

Another Japanese principle I'm quite fond of is that of Mono No Aware, the sensitivity to  what's ephemeral. It turns fleeting  moments of beauty into the very preciousness of life. 

As for the puzzle, there was nothing less than perfect about it; fleeting yet perfect. 
A very welcome breeziness for a week-ender. A delicious romp.

Thank you, Mr. McDermott!",47,positive,0.955306887626648
"I was so sure WABISABI would be kintsugi until it didn't work with any of my crosses. This one was tough for me in a few spots, as I have only seen ASSAM tea once before and didn't recall it, have always seen FAY spelled as fae, and didn't know MRT was in the WWE hall of fame. But that didn't stop it from being a fun puzzle, and I honestly found it quite refreshing. Recently I've found many of the puzzles to frustrate more than delight me, but today gave me just what I was seeking in a Saturday. A few clues on the first go-around, more slowly trickling in on each pass, and then a bit of learning at the end. A very nice puzzle!",22,neutral,0.4529038369655609
"My husband said WABISABI.  I said don't be ridiculous.  On the other hand, both of us know Bunny Lebowski from our many meetings, but neither of us knew who she really is. Nevertheless, the puzzle was done in good time, and we both had a very good time working it‚Äîno look-ups (except for my lack-of-faith look-up of the W word).

This was a lovely way to spend our Friday evening‚Äîentertaining fills that were perfectly accessible through solid crosses and no clunky cluing.  Jacob McDermott, a Saturday debut is nothing to  sneeze at, even one that included ACHOO!  Thank you, and do come back soon.",27,positive,0.6387178897857666

"26 minutes, only 1 mistake. Very good for me on a Saturday. A lot of fun and clever clues. I must strenuously object on behalf of my one mistake. It's MaMALA, as in Kamala, not MOMALA. I thought the crossing was NoG, but obviously NOG makes more sense. I didn't consider any other possibilities, though, since I've never seen it spelled any other way besides MaMALA",5,positive,0.8278489112854004

"Charles Blow isn't going to like 40D.  Trust me.

Methinks this won't get printed, but, hey, just a faithful reader of the Opinion page.

Puzzle was less problematic than real life.  Sigh.",4,negative,0.6691815257072449
"I got off to a quick start, then kept hitting little snags. None of the longer answers came quickly. And I‚Äôd run into WABI-SABI in previous puzzles but couldn‚Äôt remember what it was called. 

But every time I got stuck, I found something that gave me enough to work off of. 

The proper names really helped me out: EFRON, TARA REID and RILKE all went in right at the start. REBA McEntire showed up just as I was bogging down in the SW. 

Thanks, Mr. McDermott!",19,neutral,0.578900933265686
"That went pretty quickly, about 2/3 of my Saturday average, with enough entries that seemed to click to enable me to make kind of a skeleton to hang the rest off of. Just got stuck in the SE for a few minutes, trying to come up with the last three letters of 54A to give me a toehold in there. I'll take an explanation for 60A if anybody wants to offer one (I kept trying to make WAX or VINYL be four letters long...).",4,positive,0.6062753796577454

"Despite the fact that I did not know WABI-SABI and still think it sounds more like a condiment than an aesthetic, I finished this puzzle in what seemed like no time.  I hardly had to stop for a breath, and I completed it with a sandwich in one hand, strangely enough.  Because felt a little hungry as 10:00 hit, and since I realized that if the puzzle turned out to be a hard one, I'd have to stop in the middle for something to eat, I decided to cobble together a quick bite to take to the computer.

I needn't have bothered.  The sandwich was more of an impediment than a help, as it got in my way as I kept hitting on the next answer before I finished entering the one before it.

Maybe I was on the constructor's wavelength, but more likely, this will have been a Fri-Sat combo of two easier-than-average puzzles.",17,neutral,0.5884448289871216
