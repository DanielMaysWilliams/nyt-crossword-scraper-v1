"160 comments and no one has mentioned the connection between 43A (Usual heir in patrilineal systems) and 10D (Biblical twin of Jacob)? Mich√®le Govier deserves credit for making ESAU actually relevant, instead of being a dismissable bit of crosswordese:

Jacob and Esau

The sons of Isaac, who was the son of Abraham. As the eldest son of Isaac, Esau should have inherited the covenant with God that Abraham had passed on to Isaac. But Esau traded his birthright (inheritance) to his younger brother, Jacob, for a ‚Äúmess of pottage‚Äù (a meal of stew) when he was too hungry to consider what he was throwing away. Jacob also cheated Esau out of their blind father's deathbed blessing by impersonating him, a deceit prompted by their mother, Rebecca. The feud between the brothers ended many years later in a joyful reconciliation.

"Clunky puzzle with some bad clues. I'm sure I'm repeating what others have said, but:
APER? SPRIER? ANISES? Yikes.
""Auto setting"" would have been a subpar clue for STREET even _with_ a ? ""Self-care?"" for EGO? Come on. EGOISM or EGOTISM, sure, but EGO is too stretchy.

Finally, since when is YEAST an ingredient in sourdough starter? This clue is just plain _wrong_.

If we define ""ingredient"" as ""one of a list of items required to correctly make the recipe,"" then yeast is the one thing that is NOT an ingredient in sourdough, because it is understood as ""commercially cultivated yeast"" (aka instant yeast) in baking recipes, not the wild yeast that is present in everything, which inadvertently becomes the raising agent for traditional sourdough. I'm sure one of you ""defenders"" can pull up some more complex (usually pro bakery, volume-oriented) recipe that includes instant yeast AND starter made with wild yeast - I've seen and used a couple myself - but the very distinction of sourdough is that the dough ferments (for a much longer time, because it is necessary) using wild yeast, NOT instant yeast that can develop in an hour. 

To summarize: if you want sourdough in a home setting, yeast is the one thing you are _specifically_ not adding separately, because it would make the ""sour"" part of ""sourdough"" harder to achieve, therefore it would be _purposefully_ absent from an ingredient list. 

Why not just ""frequently used dough ingredient""? On a Tuesday, zero problem with that.",6,negative,0.7932970523834229

"Sometimes I love a puzzle more for the comments than anything else!  Here we all are, sharing our experience, and a lively discussion ensues.  Since my spouse & I are retired, we don't get much of that anymore.  
For my own part, I have decided that I am not much of a theme person.  The Sunday themes are fun, but most of the time in weekday puzzles the theme is lost on me even once it's been explained.  Themes are not why I come to a crossword. But most of the time they don't detract from the solving fun, as in today's puzzle.
I played Clue a lot as a kid, as a solitaire game. All my siblings were 10 or more years older than I, so I surrounded with toys and activities that were for much older kids & folks.  I spent hours in those rooms with the lead pipe & candlestick, and my set had a real rope, not the plastic lump that's in there these days, and I'd make up stories and scenes and situations. 
However, I didn't get any vibe of Clue while I solved the puzzle, and once I looked at 62A's clue and squinted at the circled letters, I couldn't make anything out of them, so I just carried on solving.  After reading Sam's explanation, I see the room names, but it's not clicking in my brain.
