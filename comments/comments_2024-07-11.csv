"To John WM of New Brunswick, who complained 12 hours ago of a road (re)construction project that was three years long and counting, Toronto’s got you beat by a country mile — or many kilometres, perhaps. We have been suffering through construction of a “cross-town link”  for 13 years.  It was begun in 2011 with a projected completion date of 2020. It is 2024 and we are still waiting.  In fact, several months ago, the head of the project called a news conference to announce — TUM-DE-LE-UM — that he couldn’t tell us when it would be complete.  So for the time being, only the first word of the project is apt.

Road (re)construction in Toronto is so poorly planned and so badly executed, that we have gridlock at all hours of the day on major thoroughfares.  It has led me to suggest that as a major metropolis, our welcoming slogan to visitors to our fair city should be “Expect Delays”.",2,negative,0.7465102672576904

"I just saw a reply to a comment I made on yesterday's puzzle in defense of a puzzle a lot of people were trashing because the clues were not about something they already knew:
___________

"" . . this comment is exactly how I imagine smug crossword nuts patting themselves on the back when they know ridiculously obscure references in unenjoyable crossword puzzles.  

""I'm glad you enjoyed it and I hope the lift it gave your ego serves you well. 

""I thought it was a dreadful puzzle, though, and I don't have an ounce of regret for not having the slightest idea who these proper nouns are.""

Do the people who know rappers and sports stars, math equations, or scientific or music clues I don't know feel smug and pat themselves on the back when they write in an answer?  I don't think so.

When I don't know an answer, I don't call the puzzle terrible and unenjoyable. I assume I may learn something I don't much care about, but I sure don't feel the solvers who do know the answers are preening snobs who are trying to insult me for not knowing.

"There must be a lot of people new to playing NYT puzzles, which is, of course, good, but-- they should know some basics:

1. Thursday puzzles are meant to be the tricky ones. Mondays are the easiest; Saturdays the hardest; Sundays the longest.

2. On Thursdays, learn to think outside the box. You will have puzzles where you have to put more than one letter inside one square -- these are called rebuses. They are so much a part of crossword culture, that the NYT online version actually has a ""Rebus"" option right above the puzzle. you press that and then you can type in more than one letter into one square (sometimes as many as five or even more!). And this week we had a puzzle in which you had to stretch one letter across two squares. Looking above or below for the missing letter is par for the course.

3. People who want straight-forward puzzles, with one letter per box and no tricks can buy a booklet of them at the checkout line at the grocery store for $0.99. Oops, I mean $5.99 now--or more.

Tricky puzzles give you an extra challenge that makes them fun.",10,neutral,0.7033834457397461

"A WARNING TO ALL WORDLE PLAYERS:  There's been Malware attached to that site since yesterday.  It may affect you, it may not.  But here's the email I just sent Tracy Bennett:

""Twice yesterday -- when I went to play Wordle -- but not on any other site I visited --  my screen was suddenly ""locked up"" and made unusable by some entity purporting to be ""Microsoft"", but isn't.  No cursor; no ability to access any sites; and a loud robot voice telling you to call a ""Microsoft"" number flashing on the screen.

Fortunately, I knew what to do -- having had my handyman up to bail me out on a previous occasion when I completely panicked.  (You hold down Alt, Ctrl, Delete at the same time and then ""Sign out"" when the message appears on a drop down menu.)  But to anyone who doesn't know that, the situation is absolutely terrifying.  It's a hostile takeover of your computer.

I tried Wordle again this morning and it happened again just now.

""Yes, Vera,"" I'd think, but not say, ""but if you don't get off your . . ., and get some exercise.you're never going to achieve anything, and all your self-denial will be for nought.""

While it may be true that those competetive-bodybuilder shredded abs are only made on a diet of shredded chicken breast on a bed of shredded lettuce, it amazes me how far people will go to deny themselves all the good, tasty things in life, but view any form of physical exertion with complete odium. Back in the day, Our Hunting (and Farming) Fathers didn't have to worry about such things--their lives were filled with physical exertion, and often, not enough food.

"Road bumps is a fitting theme from one with a degree in civil engineering, as today’s constructor has, according to his notes.

Furthermore, each of the bumps is directly centered over ROAD, that is, over the letters OA, which had to make the construction even tougher.

This is also a tight theme; I don’t think we’re going to see many alternative theme answers in the comments today.  It’s also original – there’s never been a bump-in-the-road theme in any of the major crossword venues.  In fact, BUMP IN THE ROAD is a debut answer not only in the Times, but in any of the major crossword venues.  

So, tight theme, lovely execution, and original.  But, most importantly, how was the solve?  I found it to be a lovely mix of footholds and resistance.  Satisfied my brain’s work ethic in some places, brought the delight of quick figure-outs in others.

So, a splendid outing, for which I’m grateful.  Bravo, and high congratulations on your debut, Mat!",61,positive,0.5202194452285767
"This puzzle is the last straw! Our small city is having its own mini-“Big Dig”  (was that term specific to Boston?), with this being year three (or so) of limit-to-limit road construction. And now, in what should be a diversionary haven of smooth sailing and straight-ahead intersections, we instead get this maze of un-even surfaces and detours.

I really wish the New York Times would develop some summer-time standards to avoid these kinds of tie-ups, and out of sensitivity to the urban realities of the season, publish such puzzles only in the winter.

(a fun one today ;)",17,negative,0.7488629817962646
"Good puzzle.

My proudest moment?

One square left.
Don’t know British politics.
Reeeeally don’t know boxing.

gO-PADOPE?
dO-PADOPE?
…Can’t be R because ROPE-A-DOPE is something else…

What is it, CC? 
That’s right, you don’t know. 
But you’re *certain* it ain’t this.

So, alphabet game for the win!

I gotta switch to coffee.

Fun, smooth theme. 

Really enjoyed the thought that went into clues like,
[When a right may be made] and
[Bad thing to be caught on]…

Happy Thursday all!

"Pretty amazing feat of construction - I just never worked out enough to completely tumble to the trick and didn't finish this one successfully. Actually surprised to see that most everyone else found this one unusually easy. 

No big deal. That's all on me.

21 letter answer dawned on me and wondered if it could possibly be used for some similar type of trick puzzle:

"I’m torn. Finding 4 entries that fit the specification *RO??AD* (with matching length for each set of 2) can’t be easy. I mean, it’s easy to search for them with a computer, but I’m surprised there were enough reasonable sounding results for a puzzle. Definite kudos on actually finding a nice set of themers for this concept, which is pretty neat. 

The problem with this clever construction is that there are surely so few good choices that meet this criterion, that there’s no way the letters in the “bump” are going to be meaningful (though like others that was my first hope). The other unfortunate problem is that when read without the bump letters, the results are meaningless. In some other constructions where the answer deviates from the normal direction, reading the letters just in proper direction will give an un-clued but valid word/phrase. I feel this is the way such puzzles should be to be aesthetically pleasing. But, again, with the very tight constraints on the theme, there would likely be no results that also produced a valid entry with the bump removed.

I’m left feeling slightly ALOP",10,negative,0.5859280824661255
I found this puzzle a bit more challenging than many of the previous commenters. Just right for a Thursday in my opinion. A good balance of gimmes and challenges plus a clever Thursday trick. Very satisfying!,17,positive,0.9729525446891785
"Congratulations on your debut, Mat.  Finding 4 fairly long entries with ROAD embedded must have been a challenge.  This was a gentle Thursday trick, but it shows you have the knack.

What a fun puzzle! Really enjoyed the theme today!! It took me a little too long to get the revealer because of hanging out with ALee too long and never having heard, at least my recollection, of ALOP.  But I knew something was very tricky off the bat at the Margaret Thatcher clue for THE IRON LADY, so I kept ALert but ALas, ALOP eluded me longer than I'd have liked. 

Favorite was the sciencists not trusting ATOMS because they make everything up! Oh, I had a good little chuckle about that one!

"Put on my lead boots when I confidently entered IronROADY, with no clue about why it would be that, and tripped through most of the puzzle, took a break to watch another episode of ""Pride and Prejudice,"" (BBC version, which we treasure on TAPE), then came back and filled in the rest, except for, you guessed it, the NW corner, which was IRON clad.  What to do? I came to the column and one glance was all it took to realize what a DOPE I had been to sail over all the other BUMPs IN THE ROAD without questioning that one.  

AH well, all's well that ends well, which it did pretty quickly.  Some sneaky clues (the best kind), but none except Ms. Margaret really did me in.

"Off-topic comment about the phone app, Android in my case.

I didn't open up the app to do the puzzle and other games until after midnight, because I was napping.

"Lovely debut, congratulations to Mr. Shelden for a clever theme, well executed. In my city we are more likely to encounter potholes, but there's really no phrase, lore, maxim, etc., in which potholes figure. They have yet to find their Lin-Manuel Miranda, and the silence of Bartlett's Book of Quotations on the subject of potholes speaks volumes. 

Extra points for Peeta and Pitas! 

And a farewell to Rishi Sunak, he proved to be no Iron Lady,
no William PITT, no Robert PEEL: the memory of him is already fading,
and so, short will be this ode
for Rishi Sunak was a mere BUMP IN THE ROAD.

""What was THAT?"" clucked the Peer from the rear of his Rolls Royce.
""Do not FRET, sir"" replied his driver, ""I  really had no choice --
just one of those goofy troubadours, but all's within code:
I shall report it, sir, as a mere BUMP IN THE ROAD.""

The Peer was caught on tape with Ivy, a braider in a Sussex spa
doing something with her FISTS that made Inspector shout ""Got ya!""
Her avowal to the stenog in court that day is that ""Uh, something...showed,
and I simply treated it as if it were a BUMP IN THE ROAD.""",39,positive,0.43560275435447693

You, the puzzler, are pummeling away at the puzzle.  It’s leaning back on the ropes, confident that you will not…

figure out that you need a rebus working two ways down and across;

have ever heard of VIAND, BELLINI, or COW TIPPER;

have the endurance to get over the BUMP IN THE ROAD.
