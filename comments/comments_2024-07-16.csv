I drink the iced tea mix throughout the rest of the day. 

The difference is that I drink the coffee deliberately, while I drink the tea because I‚Äôm thirsty or I need something to wash my lunch and dinner down with. I dislike drinking plain water, so I hydrate with the tea.

"For those expressing horror at the blend of three teas in the center, consider this:

The ASSAM is almost certainly also a PEKOE, so those two are likely one and the same, anyway. (PEKOE just means any tea made from young tea leaves. Orange PEKOE is any tea made from somewhat older leaves.) 

And PEACH tea is often made using any black tea as the base, and that black tea could easily be an ASSAM and is likely a PEKOE. 

For example, check out this ""Peach Sky Black Tea"" from my favorite source of tea, Upton Tea. There are many others made just the same way. Not my personal preference, but also not disgust-inducing.

The grid is no slouch either -- filled as it is with grownup non-Tuesdayish words like ALIENATE and WINNOWED and AMBIANCE.  And there are almost no names.

That is, a complete feel-good solving experience.  Smiling at the theme, plus oohing and aahing everywhere else.
