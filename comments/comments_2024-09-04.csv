"So many folks seem to complain about rebuses being used in the puzzle, mostly we think, because they add a perceived level of difficulty for folks who may already believe they tip-toeing into the deep water of a Thursday puzzle.
Our strategy for solving a puzzle with rebuses;
First, when you believe there is a sensible answer staring you in the face, but it just won't fit, concentrate on the fill crossing that answer, see if sections of that 'obvious' answer materialize.  
If that doesn't work, don't hesitate to move on to another section of the puzzle, but be prepared to find another answer that doesn't quite fit.
After we have a section of an answer that seems right, it's time to start looking for letter sequences that make any kind of sense when isolated into one square.
This puzzle identified the rebus squares up front by circling them for us.  To play fair this doesn't always mean they will be rebuses, but the constructor clearly wants us to wonder why they would be circled.  Then some smooth Wednesday fill to provide further clues that your crossword intuition was correct.

Hopefully this will shine more light on multi-dimensional crosswords, so folks can enjoy a satisfying 'aha'! moment instead of darkly griping about the editors.

When I saw RALLYCAR it made me miss my Subaru WRX, one of three cars I sold before moving to Europe. The young fellas used to say, ‚ÄúWow, you‚Äôre cool!‚Äù and want to race me. It had such great acceleration, an awesome sunroof and a great aftermarket sound system üé∂ . Good times!

NURSEMIDWIFE brought to mind that many of the women of my family had a long tradition of being MIDladies, as they were called. They were needed because due to segregation in the south, the pregnant women in my community were not allowed to give birth in the hospitals.  It skipped a generation, but there‚Äôs now an over representation of RNs, Nurse Practitioners, Veterinary Nurses, and LPNs among the younger generation of my extended family.

Enjoyable Wednesday!",17,positive,0.9289236664772034

"When I did my first pass and right at the start encountered the Kardashian boyfriend and the rapper, I thought: Meh, it's one of those arcane trivia puzzles, I'm toast! But in the end it was quite pleasant, and I got the unknown names from crosses.

I did lookup ONSTAR though. I don't know much about current US cars, and in Europe ONSTAR was apparently a feature of Opel cars, which I was never interested in because of their poor quality and performance (and since Opel was taken over by the French, GM's OnStar is no longer offered, anyway, as Google told me).",9,neutral,0.45148026943206787
I've just subscribed to the NYT and started doing the crosswords. I've seen the rebus button before but had no idea what it did..

"I did this puzzle between points of the US Open. I've gotten quite good at pausing the puzzle right before the serve. Needless to say, I had just heard to 66 Across dozens of times before I got to it.

Started the puzzle at the start of the third set of Tiafoe/Dimitrov. Tiafoe was up 4-2 when I finished the puzzle. I didn't miss a single rally shot",6,positive,0.5959721803665161

Thank you, Kareem Ayas, for a puzzle that could serve as an introduction to rebuses and how to spot them.  What could have been AGONY was great fun.",16,neutral,0.6298449039459229

"For once, I figured out the rebus immediately. Knew it was semi. The trick was hi(semi)nence which eminence by itself works and fits without the his but once, pretty quickly, I realized why semi went in I went to the remaining circles and filled them in with semi. A rarity for me. I truly appreciated the revealer utilizing the circle as well as the rebus. Not something seen very often",12,positive,0.5406507849693298
Fun and breezy for a Wednesday. Loved the ATARI clue. Always up for a rebus.,13,positive,0.9837167263031006
"That was a zippy Wednesday. The rebus fell almost instantly‚Äînearly a personal record. I reckon it‚Äôs in my top three.

I had to battle through the weekend puzzles in a fog of good food and drink during a quick trip out of town for a friend‚Äôs 40th. Needless to say, my streak was toppled by those two barn burners. So, I guess I don‚Äôt mind a light Wednesday after that‚Ä¶ but then again, now that the puzzle is over, I‚Äôd much rather still be solving. So, given the choice between unsolvably hard (for me) and too easy, I‚Äôll take too hard *any day of the week*.

Either way, it was a fun puzzle this evening. Thanks, Kareem Ayas!",10,positive,0.4908140003681183

"This one did not have me running around in circles or SEMIcircles, but the SEMI rebus was well done.  I thought the cross of HISEMINENCE and FUNHOUSEMIRROR was impressive.
