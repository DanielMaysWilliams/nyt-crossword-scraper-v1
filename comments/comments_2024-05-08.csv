On a related note, in November 2019 Reuters reported that Trump appointed Kellyanne Conway as ""Drug Czarina"" to oversee government response to the opioid crisis. Or is that an alternative fact?",14,neutral,0.4718359410762787
"Just this morning I learned of Jim CROCE after one of his songs came on my ‚ÄúDad‚Äôs Favourites‚Äù playlist. I asked him, how‚Äôs that pronounced? Craw-chi? Crotch? Cross? Thanks to Baader-Meinhof for that timing.",8,positive,0.7668108940124512
"Weirdly, the blue bar that normally links me to the comments section no longer shows up on my phone (since Sunday). I thought maybe the comments section was closed for some reason. Today I realized if I click on the tiny speech bubble at the top of the column it will bring me here. Huh.

I had a little trouble in the NW corner... put in ""rubbers"" first and then ""dickies"". It wasn't until I got the revealer (OH.... FUDGE!) and all the other ingredients that I realized milk was missing, which enabled me to finish under my average Wed time. MILKSOP, ARTICS, and CROCE were all unknowns to me.

I'm not a fan of fudge, but I am a fan of this puzzle!  üòä",11,neutral,0.4944542348384857
"I've never encountered SOPOR as a noun before, only soporific as an adjective. Apparently, in addition to being a regular noun, it was also a brand name for methaqualone, also known as Quaalude.",31,neutral,0.6786279082298279

"Just once, I‚Äôd like to finish a puzzle in record time (as I did today), and see other puzzlers commenting how hard it was. :)
Fun puzzle today. Like others, never heard of Arctics but pretty easy to solve around it.",21,positive,0.859727144241333
"ARCTI _ _ crossing _ ROCE and _ OPOR looked for a moment like a Natick, until the only reasonable pair of possible letters leapt out. Always gives me a sense of satisfaction when that happens.",7,positive,0.862292468547821
"Sweet theme, pretty quick solve.  I didn‚Äôt have to fudge any of the answers.  Never heard of ARCTICS before.  Live and learn.

It‚Äôs nice to see Edgar Meyer grace the puzzle with his presence.  Although I generally associate him with bluegrass or newgrass music, he‚Äôs very versatile and plays seamlessly in a variety of genres.",12,positive,0.9478225708007812
"I found the northwest corner to be quite challenging, and almost dropped an ‚ÄúF‚Äù bomb. Luckily there were sweeter alternatives at play today.

A fun and fast paced Wednesday!",25,positive,0.4486240744590759
"The title of the wife of a Russian sovereign or a female sovereign was Tsaritsa until 1721,  when it was changed to Imperatritsa (‚Äúempress‚Äù). Catherine was on the throne from 1762-1796.

"Tripped myself up by misreading the Poison Control Question and not seeing the word cases which made we wonder what a RAIr attack was since I was convinced OrS was where you treat poisonings. Wednesday time record for me, but three squares wrong. Oh, well, fun puzzle, good theme, significantly easier than Tuesday's across the board",6,negative,0.5613232851028442
