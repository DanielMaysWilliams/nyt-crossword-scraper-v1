As far as the POSOLE/POzOLE argument, I've seen both in cookbooks.  I've cataloged all of my cookbools in an indexing website, and in my personal library, there are 11 appearances of POSOLE and 9 for POzOLE.",15,positive,0.672322690486908

"So after a night of fretful insomnia, worrying that my tossing and turning might disturb the one sleeping next to me, I decided to get up an hour before the alarm, do a crossword that I might  not have time for otherwise, and still have time to read Wordplay.
Of course, many of the comments today will be attempts to come up with alternative entries: it's not as easy as it sounds, since, for the ones in the puzzle, the two parts are unrelated etymologically, or so far back it makes no difference: ""alternative alternates""?  See what I mean? However my current insomnia seems to be an example of one:

"I found this to be fairly difficult, but not for the usual reasons. I actually got all the ‚Äútricky‚Äù clues right away, save for SNOT (good one!) and ‚ÄúNAIVE‚Äù. I was sure the Mexican stew had to be ‚ÄúMenudo‚Äù, and that the Rousseau response was ‚ÄúFauve‚Äù. (Having the A, V, and E confirmed by crosses did not help matters!) I also held on to ‚ÄúI M Pei‚Äù much longer than I should have. There were some things I had never heard of (SHTETL?) and my stubborn mistakes meant some crosses were no help.

"Ok, it's time to once again come to the defense of software developers nationwide. An IT PRO will generally be the guy who sets up your computer and your network or helps you deal with non-code-related issues. People who write software (and therefore deal with bugs in code) are known as Software Developers or Engineers (or some combination of those terms). Most software developers would be offended by being called an IT PRO. 

Software Developers generally have degrees in Computer Science. People who staff IT departments are generally technicians who have been trained to maintain existing software packages, not develop new ones. While it's true that they solve issues, and issues can be called ""bugs"", these are not bugs in code but rather issues with a working system not unlike the mechanic who fixes your car. You wouldn't say that a mechanic deals with bugs.

You wouldn't call the guy who developed the Tesla an auto mechanic. Don't call the guy who developed the software an IT PRO.",35,neutral,0.737084686756134

"It‚Äôs not a terrible theme but is it worthy of a Thursday?  Hardly.  I miss a good, tricky rebus.   

This theme is nicely cohesive and there are some great answers in here that go beyond crossword-see: POSOLE, SHTETL, SCRIP and PROPHESIED were all strong.

"Rather gentle trot around the park today, but I did enjoy it and was delighted to see Rousseau and Nolde here, especially the embedded IVE in NAIVE, and the faint echo of that in Nolde, a FAUVE. 

Pacino & Roker, not Jolson & Capone.
ALIVE ALS.

The theme has the ease of a Tuesday puzzle but there is a veneer of the highbrow, not only those two painters, but Gehry and Orson, the Bolshoi Ballet, a nod to Safran-Foer's ""Everything is Illuminated,"" and the unusual foodie-fodder: purple rice, amaro, and posole. Like a Tuesday puzzle crashing the Thursday gala wearing a tux, a bit naive but with enough ego to act like a proper snot, the kind who would put an ice cub in a fine glass of Vouvray from the Loire Valley and declare that Marc Chagall is ""neo-shtetl."" You know the type of puzzle I mean. They just give off that vibe. Fine with me, I put ice in my wine too. 

Shy but deadly sorts.
RECLUSIVE RECLUSES

It's also a plus that things do come IN PAIRS here. Two kinds of acid: LSD and AMINO. Two past times: AGES AGO and ONCE. Two kinds of footwear (or foot actions): KICKS and SLIDES. Two kinds of hand-touching: a DAP and a FIRM handshake.

But it wasn't tricky enough to be a Thursday.  I know that trickiness isn't a given just because it's a Thursday, but it's a letdown when there really isn't any trick at all, just a letter substitution, the kind you might find even on a Monday, with gentler clues.
