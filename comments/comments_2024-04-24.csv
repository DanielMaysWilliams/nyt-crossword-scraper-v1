"After 2 years doing NYT crosswords, I'm so tired of seeing the same clues and answers over and over and over again. Makes the puzzles way too easy when you just need to memorize the list of go-to words, which happened without any effort on my part since they're used so often. Editor should really set a higher standard for originality. I'm cancelling my subscription and going elsewhere in the hopes of finding more original crosswords.

ANOTHER way of saying it is that each letter in the word is symmetrical and since they're all down clues, the word is laterally symmetrical. Hope this comment helps those who need to things explained differently than what I've seen so far. :)",2,neutral,0.6772083640098572

Certain ERM fills that role in today's puzzle, as does ABYSM.  OAR as a verb as well as a noun.  Those kind of things can astonish a person who's lived a whole life and never run across those usages.

"Solved the puzzle, kind of enjoyed it OK, but despite knowing what LATERALSYMMETRY means I somehow didn't catch on to the theme (till I read Sam's column after solving). I noticed that the theme answers were symmetrical in terms of the vertical series of squares matching each other in the grid, but then I kept looking up and down (which wouldn't be lateral, duhh) and not seeing symmetry. Anyway, it didn't impede the solve, and even though I've never had calculus I did tweak that last square to an 'M' when I thought ""hmm, maybe ABYSM is a word, like chasm or paroxysm or antidisestablishmentarianism,"" and then MAXIMUM made much more sense than MAXIMUs, which sounds to me more like someone from a gladiator movie.

I got LIMN but probably while uttering something that sounded very much like it (""erm"", hrrrmm, lummmnn, glurm, limmmn""), ANYWAY it was fine. Love the Simpsons clips, vaguely remember seeing that one, there can be such sweetness to some of the Simpsons eps, especially with Lisa. Very cool.

And here, for those of you experiencing borborygmus from today's puzzle, here's something rather soothing— and apt for today's theme— ""Spiegel im Spiegel"" (""Mirror in the Mirror"")"" by Arvo Pärt.

"After falling down into the abysmal abyss, I salvaged my puzzle by coming to the column. I was annoyed, but not furious as many are.  Long before that, I assumed there would be a ta-da in the column revealing that the constructor was only twelve years old (I'm not saying this to be insulting, but just telling it like I thought it was).  So much of the cluing was lacking even a whisper of hoity-toity sophistication that the editor(s) seemed to be in an uncharacteristically indulgent frame of mind. Hence my mistake about the age and experience of the constructor.  I was—not exactly stunned, but certainly surprised to learn that Jeffrey Martinovic is an experienced solver, with years of puzzles under his belt.

I have never seen puzzle themes as paramount, with the crosswords as a kind of background music to support them, so I will grant that I miss a dimension that others find important and enjoy.  But for me, this puzzle was an exercise in patience, a time-killer until the next puzzle comes along.

I am amazed at the reactions to the perfectly ordinary word “abysm.” I posted more about it (hoping to provide context) in a reply to another thread. Who knows if this post or that reply will ever get through?

I’ve pointed out before that, when the themers are in the downs it nearly always is due to the theme itself (wordplay on “up”, “down”, “rising”, “falling”, etc.). This is the case here. If MAUI HAWAII is spelled out in an across, each _letter_ has left/right symmetry; when it is a down entry, the letters _and_ the words have lateral symmetry.

BCDEHIKOX (horizontal symmetry, though not K in this font)
AHIMOTUVWXY (vertical symmetry)

"Concerning the most talked about cross of the day:

I think some people solved this cross vertically first, in which case the obvious answer is MAXIMUM, whether or not you considered making sure it fit into the theme requirement (assuming you'd even discovered the theme yet).  MAXIMUM sounds mathy, while MAXIMUS sounds, well, Roman and ancient, and would not be anyone's first choice for a math context.

But if you solved horizontally first, you almost surely entered ABYSS, which was wrong here.  But so right otherwise.  It was a cross that seemed impeccable, so if you didn't think to check, you wouldn't think twice about it.  And if you did check cursorily, you'd see MAXIMUS and say, hey, that's a word.

And since the vast majority of people either never knew anything about calculus, or have spent their entire adult lives trying to forget about it, even if you had checked, you might not have noticed anything wrong with MAXIMUS (unless of course you knew what the theme was and realized it was a theme answer).

But if you solved down first, you might not have even looked at ABYSM, since MAXIMUM is also a solid answer.

I might also suggest that adding ""poetically"" to the ABSYM clue could have helped a bit, since it's only Wednesday.

So I think that's why so many people were upset with this cross.  Not an excuse for anyone, but just a reasoned analysis.",38,neutral,0.7451938390731812

I understand the MAXIMUM/MAXIMUS debate and lateral symmetry thing. Some in the comments state that MAXIMUM is more symmetrical due to the matching start/end letters, but answers like MAUIHAWAII and MAMMAMIA have suggested it is more of a phonetic rather than lexical symmetry.
