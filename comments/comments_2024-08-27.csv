"OK, a nit.
Several times in recent memory, we've had the clue [Together, in music], or the like, and I have, ah, duetifully filled in ADUE; and I suppose ""a due"" does mean together, when, say two flute players are sharing the same (printed) part on the same stand (as they often do), and the instruction means that both players play the same line of notes. 

In scores, it's usually written ""a 2"", and one has to be careful about that, because ""2."" (or perhaps ""2do"" or ""2ème"") means something completely different--that the second player plays the line, while the first player checks her social media or steps out to use the washroom or something. And one only uses ""a 2"" when there's only one line of notes, not two lines sharing the same staff (which is also often the case).

Real ""together"" in music is ""tutti,"" which doesn't mean ""together"" either, really, but ""everyone"". But at least you can use it when more than two people are playing.

Loved the GLAM and GEMS crossing! But the CEL and MANDELBROT crossing was tough for me. I definitely don't know the mathematician but CEL should have come more quickly even though I know very little of the animation world, so that's all on me. The other answers I didn't immediately know came in smoothly enough on the crosses, like ADUE and HOTH. 

My only issue was not about the puzzle itself. I find myself struggling with shaded squares. I know some people hate the circles but they're visible to me even when I'm in them, unlike the shades. Is there a reason constructors/editors choose one over the other?

"I so wanted to tip MY HAT. But it had to be MY CAP because of the ""P"" from pHoeBE. I had all those important letters filled in and evidently I don't know one mythic ""beloved"" from another.

Life can be so confusing.

But I soldiered on, corrected everything, and was rewarded with THISBE finally coming in -- along with the themers HATED and NASTY finally revealing themselves.

Oh -- the one thing I did right today was knowing that the revealer would be BAD BREAKUP before even reading the clue.

Thank you for this: 
I tip MY HAT (48A) to any artist who emerges from one psychologically unscathed. 

For better or worse, 55D was a gimme for me -- with a shudder! When I later read your column, I felt very seen!

That said, I have always understood CRIT to be short for critique (not criticism, as you wrote).

"Terrific theme, one that invited me right from the start to try to guess the revealer before uncovering it. And oh, I came close.  After filling in three of the gray words, I looked, I saw, and I thought I conquered when my brain proffered, “BREAKING BAD!”  (Hi, @Steven from Salt Lake City!).  Alas, a letter too long, but soooooooo close.

I liked the sprinkling of answers I didn’t know – MANDELBROT (as clued), EDNA MODE, and THISBE – not only for the TIL, but also for keeping my brain engaged. Regarding MANDELBROT, I hadn’t heard of the mathematician, but I knew the word from childhood, where my grandma made mandelbrot cookies, crispy almond-flavored delicacies.

EDNA MODE is what I shot into after filling in that answer, with my brain calling out Ferber!, St. Vincent Millay!, not to mention Krabappel! of ""The Simpsons"", and Turnblad! of ""Hairspray"".

Some sweet serendipities: Names not clued as names (EARL, RONA, and ARTE), and reversal echoes (ACNE echoed by a backward INCA, and RONA echoed by a backward ANWAR).  Also, the two middle B initials for GOODE and MANDELBROT.

Thus, a splendid outing for me, a high-quality puzzle which makes this debut so promising.  Congratulations, Julia, and thank you so much!",27,positive,0.891467273235321

"Curious as to whether emus mate for life, I did some very shoddy research and found that yes, emus are monogamous, but only for the duration of each sbreeding season. Breeding season will bring emus together (after a prolonged mating ritual) and pairs will stay together until the male begins to incubate the eggs. At that point the female typically departs to mate with other males and lay additional eggs in another male’s nest. Male emus will incubate 5- 15 avocado-colored eggs for approximately 48-56 days. During incubation theses fathers never leave the nest and therefore may lose up to a third of their body weight (they can't eat, drink or relieve themselves).  After the eggs hatch, the males are the primary caregivers, spending anywhere from 5 to 15 months raising the young.
