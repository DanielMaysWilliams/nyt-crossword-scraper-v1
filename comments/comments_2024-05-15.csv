I agree with Alan Young (in comments here) that Bach never composed anything titled or known as an etude, but-but-but I rather think of the Well Tempered Clavier as a series of etude-like compositions, and there is the Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach, which might count.

"At first, I was a bit frustrated, I was starting to rack up a few cheats.  ""Beldames!?!""  On a Wednesday???  Happy B'day?  Was the creator addressing a particular solver?  But after reading the Wordplay, I understand why.   I'd failed to notice all the clues began with 'b'.   I didn't pay attention even to the 'B-B's of bumblebee, baby bottle and baseball bat (B-B-B!)  

Well made puzzle!  Thank you!",13,negative,0.6921803951263428
It is simply wrong to clue ETUDE as Bach exercise. I am disappointed that was not caught in editing.,27,negative,0.9043093919754028
"I found parts of this puzzle oddly sticky, particularly the northeast. It wasn't until I read the column that I noticed the likely culprit: the awkwardness of shoehorning every clue into a format that started with the letter B. I appreciate the whimsy of it all, but all of those Bs made the ride bumpier for me. 

It was ultimately solvable, just a bit stickier than I was expecting. I'm amazed that some felt this was as easy as a Monday!",44,negative,0.5915443897247314
"Funny how things go. I solved the puzzle quickly only using the down clues. Luckily, I didn't get bogged down trying to figure out the gimmick.",2,positive,0.7230186462402344

"I must quibble with some of the definitions.
— J.S.Bach wrote thousands of compositions, but none of them are études. (I think you would’ve had the same problem with Beethoven or Brahms).
— Meanwhile, in Thailand, the currency is the baht. One baht, two baht, many baht. No such word as bahts.",46,neutral,0.5777642726898193

"This wasn't quite a Monday but I finished it faster than Tuesday and at 7:35 it's 5:00 better than my Wednesday average. 

That said, pretty fun solve and a good theme.",4,positive,0.92612624168396

A fun one. Thanks, MaryEllen.

"I enjoyed this swarm of Bs, although it took flight faster than Monday’s and Tuesday’s puzzles.

There were a surprising number of misdirections, (brewer’s implements indeed), but so many crosses that they weren’t to hard to suss out.  And I did appreciate NICAD as battery type rather than AAA.",8,positive,0.9297270178794861
