I mostly came here today though to post something I tried to post in yesterday's comments (for the Wed.

"What a delightful theme! I enjoyed the solve so much, so thank you thank you, Brad! I guess one of the reasons I liked it so much is that I figured out what was going on pretty early. I had filled in several of the Downs in the top, being old enough to remember ERROL Flynn, then getting PIANO easily, and also getting DAD quickly—maybe because of how much I’ve been watching Dem’s convention and being reminded of the presidential numbers? 
So after initially thinking the bold letters at the beginning of theme clues had something to do with the periodic table, I soon saw that wasn’t the case, and happily got 17A.  
One of my favorite spots was GNUS, because it reminded me of that wonderful old song, “I’m A Gnu”. Back when my husband and I were living in Highgate, London, for his job, in the early 1980s, and all of our family music was on vinyl, we had a record called “All Aboard” and we listened to it constantly with our young daughters. I just looked it up and see it’s available on You Tube and various other sites. Clearly it was and maybe still is, popular. Besides the “Gnu” song, by Flanders and Swann, there was the hilarious “Laughing Policeman”. (I could go on but I’ll spare you.) 
When our grandsons were younger (they are teenagers now) it was their favorite thing to listen to in the car. Lovely memories. Anyone else familiar with the album or “I’m A Gnu”?

I got stuck again on the NE corner, bc I’ve never seen cheers and i don’t know basketball.

"Deb’s choices for illustrations of trolls and ogres are a modern prettied up and much less frightening version of the original critters.  I grew up on older versions of fairy tale illustrations of, for example, Grimms Fairy Tales and other Northern European and Scandinavian tales.  Trolls are usually human based but much more hairy and toothy and equipped with nasty claws and hunched over in an animalistic way.  Ogres are clearly human but large and muscular with nasty scowling faces and voices usually described as low and growling like a bear.

"Persepolis and Zanzibar in the same puzzle? What's not to like, at least for a history geek? Actually, 62A was confusing to me, as I remembered it being the other way around. You see, the Sultan of Oman moved his capital from Muscat to Tanzania, because that was the hub of the East African slave trade. Sure, it's thousands of miles away and not even on the Arabian Peninsula, but I guess you can do that sort of thing when you're the Sultan. Tanzania became an independent Sultanate in 1861 (after the slave trade was ended) and was promptly swallowed up by the British and the Germans.

So technically 62A is correct as clued, but it's more of a re-branding than anything else. Doesn't matter anyway; Zanzibar is part of Tanzania now.",8,neutral,0.7511090040206909

"Hard to keep track of what day it is this week. A very nice puzzle, but, thematically and otherwise, this was a Wednesday and not a Thursday offering. Oh well, doesn't really matter.

MEdals are EMMY-AWARDS. The GObi Desert is a GEO-LOCATION. ""SAy what?"" is an ESSAY-QUESTION. And RUmmy is certainly an AREYOU-GAME. 

But not so happy with NEolith. Is a NEolith really ANY-OLDTHING? Will have to hit the dictionary, but I have my doubts. After all, ""neolith"" literally means ""new stone"". (As opposed to ""paleolith"", which means ""old stone""). So my guess is that a ""neolith"", if nothing else, must be something made of *stone*.  

OK, it's a crossword puzzle, and I'm being pedantic.

"Back when I lived in the woods of piedmont North Carolina we had a stand of walnut trees.* One season I gathered up all the hundreds of walnuts to try harvesting them.

After letting them dry out for a while you run them over with your car repeatedly to start trying to remove that rind. Getting to where you have the shells we see at the store is a hard process. Getting the shells open without getting little bits in with the nut meats is a hard process. They are truly hard nuts to crack! I never tried again.

Let me remind you of his last two puzzles (spoiler alert if you haven’t done them):
• 6/19/24 – He finds “a + b” clues that perfectly match their answers.  Such as: [Wait + see] for STOPWATCH, and [Hit + run] for SLAPDASH.
• 3/6/24 – Like today, he plays with alphabet letter sounds.  Two of the theme answers: [Nicholson and Nicklaus, e.g.?] for ONE EYED JACKS (each has one ""i""), and [Søren Kierkegaard and Chris Isaak, i.e.] for DOUBLE AGENTS (that is, double-a gents).

Wow!

Today, when I uncovered my first theme answer (EMMY AWARDS), my jaw actually dropped a bit at how marvelous it worked with its clue.  I equally marveled at the other theme clues/answers.

When I marvel through a puzzle, it has more than done its job.

Another theme plus: freshness.  Three of the theme answers are NYT debuts, and the other two have only appeared once in the Times puzzle.  That’s a popping theme!

"For those of you wondering about 37D - a 'yard' of ale is a measure of beer, chiefly British, and the object of the exercise is to down this as quickly as possible.  The record is 11 seconds, allegedly by Bob Hawke when at Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship 20-some years before he became Prime Minister of Australia.  (My own PB was about 40 seconds - not unlike my NYT crossword solving time in that it is about 3 times slower than a decent time.)",10,neutral,0.8373866081237793

"Neato, looked bleak, then just did random fills here and there and before you know it I had finished my yard of iced tea and had begun versifying, ABBA style!

At the bar, Errol Garner on piano, she sipped her iced tea and I got to my Tang,
and asked her, ""Is what you're wearing what they call a camisole?""
""Oh behave,"" she replied, ""I got it at Bootie NoNo, down at the mall
in the bargain bin they had marked 'Any Old Thang.'""

Aargh, it's getting late and I can see where this one is going already, and I don't have the heart to jot it all down. Any-hoo, this was a charming puzzle, diagonally bookended with patoot and bootie -- so there! And other combos: squat & gym rat, no-no and so-so, genes & gametes...and most of all, the wonderous mind to come up with those themers: RUmmy, my particular fave. 

Fun and saucy, too. Show me the boy toys and I'll show you the Norsemen. And weird that army ants are suddenly showing up, but that's how army ants are: first you see one, then you see another, and before you know it they've taken over the world and have made all humans their slaves, toiling away in vast potato chip factories and candy mills. Like E. O. Wilson meets Rod Serling...",13,neutral,0.5859413146972656
"Too easy. Not far from my personal best, but I'm a slow solver. I imagine someone with a younger, more nimble brain than mine (which has been around for almost 77 years) could have knocked this one out in 5-10 minutes.",3,negative,0.7253331542015076

"I can't say whether the puzzle was easy or hard—I did it on AUTO PILOT, but it must have been easy.  I just plugged in ANY OLD THING, because I was listening to speeches while I solved. There were a lot of things that just slid in and they were right.  SO THERE!

Good job, Brad Wiegmann!

"For me, this was a great example of the sort of puzzle that seems extremely hard on Pass 1 (very few confident answers), but gets progressively easier the more times you give it a spin. Really satisfying solve.",63,positive,0.9654004573822021
"This week of Thursdays. 

I got the theme answers all right without lookups!! So surely, if I look at any other comments they will say today was too easy of a Thursday.  And yknow what?! I don’t give a rats flying patootie. 

Great puzzle! Thanks for the fun.  

I also just got through ICED TEA on 3/16/21 which was also a great puzzle with an awesome theme.  

Have a great Thursday everyone! Make it a wonderful day!",11,positive,0.8144614100456238

Too easy for a Thursday puzzle. The puzzles lately have suffered from a lack of difficulty and good editing.,4,negative,0.838209331035614
"Some of us like to think that solving puzzles, in addition to being fun, keeps us sharp.

So, I should be able to pinpoint the puzzle I’m thinking of that also used a “sound out the letters” idea.  Right? Except it involved leaving those letters out. Of the clue. (Maybe)

One of the themers was the name of a female opera singer? Actor? Greek goddess?

It was a year ago. Maybe.

If anyone can remember what or…

Wait, wait, it was “no RSE goddess”. Found it, 11/2/23.  And now I see that theme is really different from today’s after all.

Well, I hope you all enjoyed my ESSAY QUESTION. Are there EMMY AWARDS for convoluted bad memory?  I guess ANY OLD THING will satisfy me!",11,neutral,0.6118555068969727

"“Someone once told me that you can’t just put any old thing in a crossword puzzle and expect it to get published. I guess they were wrong.”

This is such an accurate description of this puzzle. No clue on the theme but still solved it in one pass. Felt more Tue/Wed than Thu.",4,neutral,0.5641714930534363
"This is how a theme is done!  Yesterday's novice constructor should take many, many notes.

Yeah maybe overall this puzzle was too easy, but it was well made and the theme didn't lie there like a dead fish furtively planted on a child's hook.  It held together, consistent and coherent.  It was clever.  It wasn't arbitrary.  Each answer was different and satisfying and fresh.  It was fun!

Enjoyed this one.  Thanks.

"Re 15A (IRAN) - by coincidence, an email newsletter I received today included a link to a video created by the Getty Museum for an exhibit from a couple of years back titled ""Persia:  Ancient Iran and the Classical World.""

The video shows a virtual reconstruction of Persepolis as it was at the height of the Persian empire.  Five minutes long, and utterly fascinating:

"I caught on to the trick relatively quickly (at GEOLOCATION) and it made the solve much faster than it might otherwise have been.  I went to all the theme clues and entered the words that mimicked the bolded letter pairs, which in turn made the full theme answers apparent.  With such a big foothold, the rest of the puzzle fell quickly, despite some tricky clueing.  My favorites were top of the order for ABBOTT and tootsie treat for PEDI (naturally I filled in roll first).",8,positive,0.8543342351913452
