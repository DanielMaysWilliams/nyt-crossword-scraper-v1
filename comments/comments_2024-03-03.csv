I had ??US and wrote in PIUS without a second thought.  It didn't take me long to correct to (6)TUS -- but still, it gave me my biggest ""Aha!""

The only* drawback (which was emphatically not Hoang-Kim‚Äôs fault) was that I was able to figure out the theme from the title and Will‚Äôs note (with the hint ‚Äúfitting, given the theme!‚Äù) even before filling in the first entry. As a print solver in the magazine, I saw the ten hyphen clues right away and guessed what was going on. While I didn‚Äôt think immediately think of a (TEN)T DRESS, I saw the trick at ALUM(NINE)WSLETTER and from there was able to drop the numbers into their spots.

While that made for a bit of a speedier solve, and dispensed with the usual buildup to an ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moment, none of that detracts from a terrifically impressive construction. Thanks Hoang-Kim for the fun puzzle. 

*PS ‚Äî I understand the concern about 45A and was grateful to learn something new (although I think it could have been introduced into the comments with a bit more grace.)

"I was hoping for even more of a countdown coincidence since there was supposed to be a Space X rocket sending a few folks to the ISS this evening, but alas, it was scrubbed but it's tentatively rescheduled for late Sunday evening eastern time, so that countdown will hopefully coincide with this one.

Worked on my iPad this evening, trying to keep my left foot up, as I'm dealing with a newly officially diagnosed 5th metatarsal fracture that's a little over two weeks old.

Nurses (like myself) are horrible about going to the doctor. Don't be like us. Speaking of nursing, I finally let my license lapse (it expired March 1) after being retired since 2013.

As for the crossword, I'm impressed with the construction, but managed to figure out the countDOWN fairly early with TENT DRESS, and FREIGHT TRAIN, which made it a little easier since I knew what to do when acrosses didn't seem to be all there.

Yet overall I had mixed feelings about the countdown theme, wanting it to end with a cool graphic takeoff effect (bound not to work on various apps and platforms, since the tech emus in the Games Dept. don't always BETA TEST, yo!) or some fill at the end to blast us off. Instead, we get the opposite, ""Concern at the end of a space journey."" I so wanted something to happen after I did the count down, which is all about the anticipation of release. Relief denied is justice delayed! Or something.

""Red caps"" have an interesting history. They were first worn by Black porters, starting in 1890, to distinguish them from the blue caps (mainly white) who had other duties. The red cap then became symbol of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters as they organized under the guidance of the great A.

"We caught onto the theme after a few minutes which helped a lot. This puzzle was so elegant, kudos to finding all those words which include the numbers. And no naticks!",6,positive,0.9726710319519043
"I saw that ‚Äú-‚Äú in each case was to be replaced by a digit‚Äôs name spelled out. But, I underthought (almost as bad overthinking) the ‚ÄúCountdown‚Äù of the title as being satisfied by their mode of entry, downwards in grid. This meant that I lost the chance of getting immediate entries for later occasions. 
A pity, not only for that reason but the failure to recognise a seriously creative constructor‚Äôs work.",11,negative,0.573417067527771
"Caught on to the notion of the numbers but I filled them in with rebuses at first, and then saw the trick so had to change it to get my gold star. Blown away by the construction! How do they do that?

I can‚Äôt help but see STU for the name of five popes though! (I know it‚Äôs Sixtus but it jumps out at me as Stu).",50,neutral,0.5217256546020508
"Wow! Finding ten phrases, and then placing them in order from TEN down to ONE is quite a remarkable feat of construction. And in most cases the number spans across two words. 

This was great fun, and definitely a case where getting the theme early on was a big help with the solve. SIXTUS, TENT DRESS and EARTH REENTRY are so clever. 

Congratulations, Hoang-Kim. This was a blast!",73,positive,0.9602054357528687
"The theme didn't hit me right away, but when it finally dawned on me  about a quarter of the way through the grid the first word to come to mind was ""brilliant!""",10,positive,0.8608767986297607
"I thoroughly enjoyed this puzzle. I didn‚Äôt clue into the theme until over half way into the solve. I found the centre, with SANDRALEE, ONEILL, ALBEE and NENEH, a bit rough.

After the puzzle, I tend to look up answers to clues I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm not sold that a TTDRESS is a known thing lol nonetheless a delightful puzzle. Thanks!",4,positive,0.9295974373817444

"Apropos of nothing, but since the comments section for the Variety Puzzle has already been closed down, let me say that this Sunday's Split Decisions was particularly enjoyable.",4,positive,0.907077968120575
"Ancient Greeks used letters of the alphabet as numerals, and they are still used as ordinals in Greece today. Greek X = 600 and Greek Y = 400.",7,neutral,0.9275479316711426
"At last, a sweet addition to the tamale club! Even if you only had room for one tamale and one panini, you can have multiple ‚Äúpetit fours‚Äù after, because they are small.

I enjoyed the delayed aha of this - the numbers made their presence known quite awhile before I knew what to do with them.",21,positive,0.9099372625350952
Fun to have a tricky theme on a Sunday.   Well done!,18,positive,0.9745511412620544
