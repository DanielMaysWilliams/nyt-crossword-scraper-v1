"Wow, this one was incredibly tough for a Tuesday, in my opinion. I should say that I love learning new terms with cultural significance (even though I know that varies), such as NUYORICAN, as they make up such a large proportion of New York City's population.

However, plenty of other terms which seemed very obscure for a Tuesday. Clues like ERG/BARRE, RIPSAW, and EAP were incredibly tricky for me. While ""ASILIVE"" ""AND"" ""BREATHE"" were nice, the rest of the themed hints involved a lot of unsatisfying guesswork and lacked any ""Aha!"" moments. Sadly, it broke my 4-time Tuesday streak and it was the toughest Tuesday puzzle I've seen in a while.

And now for NUYORICAN.  (Google's not underlining in red, so I guess it's a word.)  Not only am I a lifelong New Yorker, but I live not all that far from Spanish Harlem.  But I've never heard it and I was trying to think of where the country called NUYOR was located on the map?

I guess I’m not super surprised that not a lot of people knew NUYORICAN, although it is definitely a term, and one I’ve heard for years now, so I think it’s a perfectly legitimate entry.  

More surprised to hear people not know AREPA, or to complain about RAH and DASHIT.  The first I thought was pretty common (and really good, you should try one if you haven’t yet! They even have them at Trader Joe’s premade, although those ones are bad).  RAH is clued so well to me and makes so much sense, it’s super common to see people leaving comments like “Let’s gooooo RAHHHHH” when they’re pretending to get hype about something.  And DASHIT, first I had DArnIT, and then got it from the crosses, and have heard it from plenty of period pieces so also don’t feel like that was too hard for a Tuesday.

I did get stuck on the SAHL/SHAH cross for a bit and had to run through some letters to see what made sense, especially have never heard of SAHL, although it seems like a lot of commenters have (I don’t remember him from past puzzles either, oh well); so I’m wondering if some of the tougher clues from today are just a generational gap thing.

Serendipities in the grid are lovely quirks themselves.  Today we have two AE-enders, four palindromes (CDC, EWE, MAAM, TAT), plus the neighboring ITs of DASH IT and CHEEZ IT echoed by AS IT HAPPENS.

When I completed the grid (maybe around my average time) I was told it was not correct. Sure that the error was with NUYORICAN (which I had never heard of, and which seemed like it must be wrong), I spent a lot of time trying to find my error there. Eventually (from the crosses) I decided that it must be correct and went looking elsewhere, and realized that my spelling of aLIA Kazan was probably wrong (my choice of spelling it with an “a” instead of an “e” was a mental coin toss).

With my crosses it spelled out exactly what it was. imagine my surprise when it was correct. The rest of the puzzle was charming. 

Although, and this is just nitpicking on my part. Dropping an anchor isn't really 20Aing it. All part of that worrisome NW corner.  To secure that boat, one might want to do both, drop anchor and 20A.  If you are dropping the anchor, you're just dropping the anchor. To 20A it, you have to attach the boat to something. Like wrapping the line around a dock post on a pier.  It can even be a buoy if you're away from the dock. Point being, these are two distinctive and separate actions. You can anchor a boat to something without dropping the anchor I suppose. But the clue was specific. Like I said nitpicking. 🤓 LOL.

Yeah, it's Paris 2024 24/7 chez J'Ezra. Volleyball, water polo, wrestling, badminton, tennis, shooting, equestrian, field hockey, or any combination thereof (equestrian wrestling - yesh!), we're there. 

Heard the Aussie Emu team basically took bronze, silver and gold in their event, Sinkronized Flying. Their plummeting after being dropped from drones far above the Seine was simply sublime. As I live and breathe I shall never forget seeing these dots in the sky grow larger and larger till you could see they were full grown 800 lb. emus in golden helmets dive-bombing into the Seine with a crowd-drenching splash, dash it! They put up scores not seen since Arianna Huffington was knee-high to a ripsaw. Raw talent, baby, raw talent.",33,positive,0.9012994766235352
"Fun, challenging Tuesday. I had CHEETOS fora long time for orange crackers, thinking the entire time they aren’t crackers, but then what are they, so maybe they are. 

Also had DRAWL for some time instead of TWANG. Tx for a great puzzle!",24,positive,0.8522033095359802
"At first I thought I was gonna have to cheat, on a ""so-called"" Tuesday.  But I fought it through and won.  I had 'tenses up' for 'seizes up'.  'Dash it!"" for 9D does make more sense than the collection of letters I'd had.  I did enjoy the theme, though.",7,positive,0.4329040050506592
"I took a little longer on this one than the usual Tuesday.  I didn’t get much out of the acrosses in the top half, and didn’t start to really make progress until I got to the bottom half.  The downs were sufficiently easy to make it all come together fairly smoothly.  For a theme with no revealer, the pattern became clear fairly quickly.  A bit a quirky puzzle for Tuesday, and a nice change of pace.",18,neutral,0.5841403007507324

Were EWE done ASAP?",11,neutral,0.8986096978187561
"How many people will come to say:

They used the same word (AS) in answers five times.

Doesn't that break some kind of rule?


Pre-emptive answer:  No, it doesn't.",16,neutral,0.5138317942619324
