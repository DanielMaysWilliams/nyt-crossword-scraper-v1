"OH, PLEASE. Ha!

Deb: I wonder what it must be like to see a puzzle like this, knowing you must introduce it--is it more challenge or dare? Is it harder to write this column when the day's puzzle has this much personality, or do you welcome the direction it offers? Either way, your column did a fantastic job of it, as always.

And the EDIBLE UNDERWEAR puzzle, by the way: you referenced that a few weeks back, as well. It's not only a great case in point for RIBALD cruciverbalism, but a potent reminder that these puzzles have gotten a bit easier over the years. Completing that puzzle took me four times (!) as long as completing today's.",4,positive,0.8428292870521545
"Bah! I solve the puzzle with my great- and great-great-grandchildren and object most strenuously to this newfangled kind of puzzling! Bring back the trivia about the original cast Pirates of Penzance and other reasonable and fun clueing!

More seriously, a very fun puzzle. I felt fast, but was not fast â€” personally I'm most proud of having been able to get a US drug brand name at 39D.",28,positive,0.9168618321418762
"I think the clearest sign of the New New York Times puzzling is not only the existence of 56A, but that it was used for the headline for wordplay.

Bravissimo!",13,neutral,0.6541867852210999
