"Some oldies for this oldie.  Zipped through this easy as abc Monday puzzle.  I had fun. Got another Deuce in WORDLE today, ü§¥üêù'd in SP, and didn't embarrass myself in Connections, found all the words in Strand, and finished the Monday Crossword in a minute or so over my best time.  I type slower these days, so I have to solve faster.  

Have a wonderful day y'all! Cheers from Texas where we are eagerly awaiting a cold front to drop us into the 80's. üòÄ",5,positive,0.9608231782913208

"Late puzzle find - one of the strangest I've ever encountered. A Thursday from September 11, 1997 by Matt Gaffney. The them answers were paired, with one being a clue to the other. Here's a couple of examples: 

56a -
""17-Across, in other words :""
YTTJJU

And then 17a - 
""What's the point of annoying Leno's sheep?""
WHYTEASEJAYSEWE

----
52a - 
""38-Across, in other words :"" 
KKIICDD

And then 38a - 
""Singers Starr and Kiki look at each other :"" 
KAYSEYESSEEDEES

Can't imagine having much of a chance with that one. Here's the Xword Info link:

"Just seconds away from a Monday personal best. I don't know how to get much faster in early week puzzles... not because of my brain but my fingers. Later week puzzles are getting faster because of my brain and from learning the crossword ropes but early week, I feel like I move as fast as I can but can't break 7 minutes. I had no hang-ups in today's puzzle at all. 

Sure, there were a couple things I didn't know, like KIR and NTSB but I didn't need to know them, they kindly showed themselves in and stayed. 

Amazed that I immediately placed EDITH for Piaf who sang ""La Vie en Rose"".  A fact that I never knew prior to doing puzzles and today it just came to me. Huzzah!

"Slight hold-up in my solve bc Diana Ross did most definitely *not* moonlight as a flagmaker! Doh. 

Loved EASYASABC for a Monday solve!

Speaking of which, I have a quick question for the speed solvers out there: the most obvious approach to solving quickly is to just go through each clue, across or down, sequentially. Is that how y‚Äôall do it, or does anyone here have a specialized approach?

"Not sure, but I think this is the first puzzle I finished almost completely on the first run through on Across. Almost. I didn't even look for the theme until it was completed. Not my best time ‚Äì off by almost two minutes ‚Äì which is fine. 

Very enjoyable! Some fun cluing, for me. Loved the clue for USE, which will have me ear-worming songs from Carousel all day (just me? Anyone?). I had to go back to read a lot of clues, just to see what they were after it was all filled in. 

One of the reasons I was able to finish it quickly (besides it being a Monday, of course) is because Hubby was out of the house for a dr. appt. Usually he interrupts me several times, adding at least a minute, sometimes five, to my time. 

Happy Monday, friends. Off to the hospital for me. I won't be volunteering at the ER much longer; they are moving us out, and replacing us with paid personnel. Now they see how valuable we are, we are being replaced with people who won't do nearly as much as we do. Oh well. Look for me at the info desk in the cancer wing.",9,positive,0.6479352116584778

Today‚Äôs clue [Someone walking in front of a train] made me laugh out loud when I figured out the answer from the crosses.

The puzzle is well and professionally made, but that's hardly enough to make it exciting.

"Freddy has range.  While well more than half of his 17 NYT puzzles are Mondays and Tuesdays, he also has a pair of themeless puzzles filled with cluing deftness.  For example: here's one where he made a drab answer shine -- [Illustration, for example: Abbr.].*

The NE and SW corners of this grid are islands, that is, have only one answer coming in from outside.  Islands can be nerve-wracking on the tougher puzzle days of the week, but not today, because it‚Äôs Monday-time, and the cluin‚Äô is easy.

Some lovely serendipities today.  A pair of PuzzPairs¬©: YELP/YEOW and HIALL/HELLO.  Answers that become names when read backwards: TAP, AROD, AVE, and IRA.  And, I guess because my brain was really on the prowl, answers that are homonyms of other words: DEW, TEES, TIERS, NIT, TOE, and WERE.

And, by the way, regarding this theme, try coming up with other in-the-language phrases ending in initialisms.  Then try to come up with pairs of them that contain equal numbers of letters.  There‚Äôs high skill behind this theme.

Because you have such range, Freddy, I never know when I‚Äôm going to see one of your puzzles next, but I‚Äôve learned that it will be of superb quality.  Thank you for a splendid outing today!

We had The Boss, La M√¥me Piaf, Miss Peaches, la Selenita, a hit West End musical, and the ubiquitous (and brilliant) Mr Eno.

Then we had prog giants Yes; a line very close to the lyric of an old Jackson 5 hit single; the energetic former Van Halen frontman popped up (twice); and in Latin, the second word of an ancient liturgical chant.

'Cause gold stars make me smile,

Well, Freddie asked ""What's you eta?""
Cause he clued it 44, and so I solved it
But Freddie, I don't understand, why so many tarot cards fall out of NYT pockets
