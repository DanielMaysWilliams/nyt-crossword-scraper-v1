"I finished this last night in very short order. Because I'm generally not very fast, I like to see how fast I can go on Mondays... but that means I sometimes miss the fun of it. I don't care much about time so maybe I should stop caring at all—including Mondays. 

For example, I completely missed the fun secondary theme during the solve, which is too bad, but I'm glad Sam called attention to it!

Also, I'm just going to say it, my favorite was MAC! I've read the comments, so I understand the Venn diagram controversy but it is one of the clues that caught my attention in the moment and made me chuckle. 

Yesterday, I was going on about how glorious TACOs are (not mere snacks) so today I'll add that they are especially superb when they include salsa verde!  It's my favorite—and TOMATILLO went right in. 

Also, I always love Sam's choice of photos! They are occasionally lost on me but not usually—but they are never spoilers! Not a problem on my phone, but when I solve on my computer, I can't help but see the photo below the puzzle (at least not that I know of), so it's nice when they are funny nods to the puzzle but not spoilers.",4,neutral,0.3858817517757416

"Too late to comment on the exquisite Sunday Puzzle due to Fathers' Day Festivities. But I have to, so I'll do it here. It was such a wonderful mashup of my two favorite NY Times games! That it was a fast solve was appreciated this Sunday.

Funny story: my husband daughter and I went to an old NYC haunt, and new one for my daughter: The Holiday Cocktail Lounge on St. Marks Place. The bartender there has a bet with another bartender friend that she can come up with a Connections game every day for a month. She's into her second week. We not only played her connections games which were satisfyingly tricky, but we also gave her ideas for other connections games. A blissful way to end an excursion to the city for great Chinese food.",5,positive,0.9510235786437988

How fun to have a tricksy puzzle on a Monday morning!  

Old folks like me want ON AIR for the 'broadcast.'

Of course I wanted a COLANDER instead of a SIEVE, but I do use the latter when washing brown rice before cooking it.  But it's a big SIEVE, so I call it a 'strainer'.....never a 'sieve.'  Maybe it's all in my head.

"Tomatillos are the main ingredient in salsa verde, which is fun and easy to make at home when tomatillos are fresh and seasonal (July to September).

Choose firm tomatillos of medium size and tear away their papery husks. Cut into quarters and cut away any stem ends. For a pound of tomatillos:
Add 1 serrano chile pepper (seeded & minced) and 1/2 of an onion (diced fine). Stir into sauce pot with
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (coriander)
1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
and add a cup of water or more but not too much.
Bring to a boil then lower to simmer until the tomatillos are mush. Cook longer until desired thickness. Blend into a puree. Making your own lets you adjust the flavor to your own tastes.

"I loved the theme of this puzzle and found it so cute! However, I want to point out a couple of factual errors in the clues. First, cryptography refers to encoding, not decoding. The correct term for decoding would be cryptanalysis. Secondly, the clue about the Venn diagram should have referred to the intersection of the two circles, not the entire diagram. These are perhaps technical mathematical distinctions that a lay person should not be expected to know, but if a constructor delves into the field, they should be held to a higher standard.",6,positive,0.6754223704338074
"Kiran’s puzzles warm my soul, as they teem with humor and wordplay.  Two examples:
• The theme of his May of ’23 puzzle.  Here are two of the clues/answers: [Length, for example] for SEVEN LETTERS, and [Scientific definition, for short] for ELECTICAL FAULT.
• In another puzzle, his clue for MALL – [Chain letter?].

And here again today, humor and wordplay in his theme.  This is one of those themes that can add an extra challenge – after uncovering the three theme answers, can you guess the revealer?  (I, who am weak at this skill, once again failed, but had a grand time trying!)

I loved the serendipities that popped up as well:  
• ON TOP being exactly there.  
• OCEAN crossing AYE AYE CAPTAIN (Hi, @Henry Su!).  
• AT BAT sharing the grid with STAB, which backwards is …
• Four palindromes (ERE, AAA, AHA, ALA).
• The tennis answer LET echoed by nearby abutting ACE and SETS.

"I enjoyed this clever puzzle. The only clue I had an issue with was: Yiddish ""Yeesh!"" (49D) = OY VEY. 

At the risk of coming off pedantic, YEESH! is used to express irritation or eye-rolling annoyance. Whereas OY VEY in Yiddish is used to express dismay, grief, or worry. It literally translates as “Oh, woe”, meaning “Woe is me”. It doesn’t necessarily have to imply that dramatic a reaction but it conveys fluster more than eye-rolling exasperation.",3,positive,0.7370791435241699
