"(If I attached this to my earlier comment, it would be below the fold and no one would see it.)

I'm thinking that one of the problems is that there are two themes in the puzzle, but there's only one revealer.  CROSSEDABEAR explains the BEAR theme, but not the sound-alike theme.  It's an example of the sound-alike theme, but it's not an explanation.

This would have worked better, I think, in a Sunday puzzle with a headline because the headline could have provided a hint to the 2nd theme.  Some possibilities:

NOBODY UNDERSTANDS ME!
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAY, IT'S HOW YOU SAY IT
WAS THAT A SLUR, SIR?

Frustrating, I had answers that fit but were incorrect, Duke over Elon, Iris/eyes over Uvea, Rock over Redd.

This was also the case yesterday with lone eagle over bald eagle. 

A suggestion as well, make the clue ""something you shouldn't take lying"", omitting the down from the end makes the answer Polygraph much more satisfying. The Earl cluing was also a large stretch. Theme just did not click for me in a satisfying way. 

Abel was delightful.

"Congratulations on your NYT debut, Mr. Hale! I admire your persistence!

Your grid took me back to my childhood, reminding me of the stuffed Toucan Sam that I got by eating way too much Froot Loops cereal when I was about six or seven, and the Matchbox cars that were among my brother‚Äôs and my favorite toys.  

I don‚Äôt hear SKEDADDLE often, which is too bad. It‚Äôs such a fun word. 

Thanks!",19,positive,0.9563739895820618
"I enjoyed this puzzle for the most part. The clueing was on my wavelength, and I understood the ""crossed a bear"" part of the theme, but the ""sounds like"" feature was lost on me (and, really, having read the column - those answers and expressions they supposedly sound like don't actually sound the same, do they?).

Sadly, there was a lot of trivia, and much of it was of the worst kind for a foreigner like me - American sports teams, sports organizations, universities and a guy from SNL. As always though, that is on me, as nobody is forcing me to solve American crosswords. And this puzzle still felt easier than this week's Monday!",46,positive,0.6708659529685974

I also think it's because when I say READIEDAROCK, it's ""reh-dee-duh-rock,"" while READY TO ROCK is ""reh-dee-two-rock,"" which is close but not the same.",14,negative,0.5441462993621826

Any puzzle where you have to SKEDADDLE is okay by me.

"Dear Nathan Hale, 

It must be a burden to share one's name with a Revolutionary War hero & martyr who was captured (later, executed) by the British while on an undercover mission to gather intelligence in New York City. But now you've lived up to his legacy by your SUB-mission to New York City's paper of record, in the games section no less, where there is a gathering of intelligence like no other.* OK, the connection is a bit strained -- I'll keep working on it. Also, it shows noble character that you happily credited the editors for one of the better clues (POLYGRAPH). 

Funny puzzle, and this is probably the carping of a puzzle-twit, but I'd have preferred the long themers to have some kind of relationship with the particular bear they are crossing; I imagine that would have taken more intelligence gathering than humanly possible. On the other hand, the elegant working of the dizzying amount of double letters including twin vertical ING/INGs in the SW corner was dazzling. 

Bet I wasn't the only one who filled in Chris ROCK at first up in the NW, only to have to REDDY up the ROCK soon after. (Man, my quips are so rough this time around I might need to gather a bit more intelligence myself!).

* this has probably been talked about on the chatline, but there's a great article in one of the latest Vanity Fairs about the game staff and puzzlemeisters at the NYT, worth the read...

"Mr. Hale, if you really, really really -- and I mean really --enjoyed making this puzzle, then yes, I enjoyed solving it as much as you enjoyed making it! 

I confess I hadn't gotten the second layer of the theme until Sam pointed it out, but the first layer was stand-alone sweet and entertaining.

As I took my time savoring the cluing, the one that I found the most joy in was ""Article in Le Monde."" 
It's not an uncommon misdirect, I know, but that's exactly what brought a smile to my face. 
Just three years ago, when I started doing puzzles, I would have muttered ""Well, how am I supposed to know which article they're talking about?""
And now here I am, filling in that UNE without pulling any hairs, and remembering an old Virginia Slims slogan for its cigarettes ad: ""You've come a long way, baby.""

And so I say thank you to all of you commentors and column writers who have brought me this far and helped me learn and understand the magical world of crosswords. 
I couldn't have come all this way without you.

And to you, Mr. Hale, thank you for this very satisfying honey bear of a puzzle and congratulations on your d√©but! 
May this be only your first to be published here.",36,positive,0.9726125001907349
"I‚Äôm sure Mr. Hale gets this way too often, and perhaps one should know better than to make a joke about someone‚Äôs name, but let me at least be the first to inaugurate it in the NYT crossword community:

Nathan Hale did not ‚Äúregret that he had more than one theme to give to his crossword‚Äù.

Honestly nice debut. I got the bears quickly (even Boo-boo, I guess that shows my age) but the across clues gave me some paws. It‚Äôs a bit of a nit that the across theme really didn‚Äôt have anything to do with the down theme, but heck two themes are better than one and it was really fun and clever. Great debut and a revolutionary idea.",14,positive,0.5406299829483032

"Congratulations on your debut, Nathan! This was a fun Wednesday. I have three observations to make.

(1) There is a missed opportunity with the cluing  of 15A. Instead of the NFL player, how about ""Schoolmate of the constructor's namesake, maybe""

(2) The themer/revealer CROSSEDABEAR brought to mind the fun fact that the constellation known as the Southern CROSS has stars that navigators use to find the Southern Celestial Pole, just as the constellation known as the Little BEAR has a star (Polaris) used to locate the Northern Celestial Pole.

(3) I loved the punny cluing of POLYGRAPH.",8,positive,0.8605882525444031
