"I don’t know that I’ve ever seen a better example of why the Newsday Saturday Stumper (which is routinely more difficult for me than the NYT Saturday puzzle) takes me about four times as long as some other puzzles.

Here are four clues from today’s puzzles. The first two have the same answer. The last two have another answer that’s the same for each puzzle.

Stumper: “Whom an ocean was named for”

Universal: “Geographic reference book”

Stumper: “Cookout serving”

Universal: “Dish of skewered food: Var.”

You could argue that the two Stumper clues would not be out of place in a Saturday NYT puzzle, and I wouldn’t disagree. Part of what makes that puzzle so challenging is that virtually every clue is vague or tricky.",2,neutral,0.46695560216903687

Heathie and I were both absolutely sure Queen was OPERA rock.  Likewise, I was sure that BAR was what made Mars different from Queen.

"""For Whom the Bell TOLLS.""  I remember that.  Now what the heck is the title of his other major novel set during wartime?  I could not think of ""The Sun Also RISES"" for the life of me.  In went the very wrong TOLLS into 46D, sort of confirmed by the final ""S"". And therein hangs a tale...

Because of a bad case of Senioritis, I had to cheat in the SE corner.  (On coach ERNIE, as it turns out.)  If I'd just had RISES, I might not have had to cheat at all.

Well, of course I had Senioritis this morning.  I'm a whole year older today than I was yesterday.

My other big hiccup was the exclamation in hospital dramas.  ""CLAMP!"" went in immediately.  I was so sure.  Back in the day, surgeons shouted ""CLAMP!""  No one shouted ""CLEAR"".  I haven't watched any hospital dramas in decades and I don't even know what CLEAR means.  CLEAR the hallways?  CLEAR those arteries?  CLEAR those sinuses? 

Anyway, I finished with one cheat. There was a vagueness to some of the cluing that I had trouble with.  The UNSEE clue (45D) captures that vagueness perfectly.  It's CLEAR enough once you've gotten it, but before you get it, it could be just about anything.",9,negative,0.6252133250236511

"Definitely not the easiest puzzle, but I managed to get through it without much in the way of trauma. The grid looked pretty empty for a while, but I managed to get a few answers in, then the rest came, but slowly. Put in a couple, took them out, then put them back in as crosses confirmed. Several other spots where crosses suddenly provided AHA moments, which were greatly appreciated.

I didn't have any specific sections that I felt to be more difficult than any other—a few things went in easily, then the rest were more of a struggle. My solving flow was NE, E, NW, SE, W, and SW.

I've heard CLEAR way too many times, and I do have an objection to the ICU ""standbys"" clue. No such thing as ""standing by"" in the ICU, between patient care and voluminous charting. When I did dialysis in the ICU I had enough ER experience to be able to watch the patient and give the assigned RN a bit of a break (or let them work with other critical patients). Never called a pitchfork a HAY FORK, but it was guessable. Spent many Saturday afternoons on the field AT THE HALF during the fall. It didn't take long to remember the alternate spelling for the Turtles' song (after I'd put in the usual one, of course).

I wouldn't call this a fun puzzle, but it was a good one, and deserving of a Saturday slot. Thanks, Warren.",7,neutral,0.5564907789230347

Well, that's how my brain remembered the song lyric, so I'm pretty sure I've never seen the title in print. That gave me UGH, THANKS for quite a while, and I think the YES in 14D was the last barrier to fall.

Nice Saturday puzzle, just hard enough to make it interesting. I vastly prefer the 'deducible' answers to banging away at crossing letters. POLAR BEAR was a perfect example, same for URUGUAY. Some day, Denmark will win the World Cup.

Oh yeah, the actual song lyric is ""gee, I think you're swell.""",5,positive,0.8837212324142456

Last to fall for me was the SE. Loved ""Edible wrapper"" once I got it, but it was tough to see at first: I kept wanting sEED when I had only the end, even though it makes zero sense.
