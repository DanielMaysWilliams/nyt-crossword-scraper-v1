"Reposting my reply to Cindy:

Oh, my...where to start?  To begin, you're not excluded, but let's examine what you're offended by.

Before Christine Jorgensen, there was no need for a word like CISGENDER. Since its definition means that you're the same sex as when you were born, there was no need back then to have such a word, since you could have just said ""people"". Before there were transgender people, there was no need for a word to describe those who were not.

For many decades, the number of transgender people was so infinitesimal that those who weren't, i.e. practically everyone on the planet, if they had to be distinguished from the transgendered, were just called ""normal"".  That label was the offensive one, but since people generally unbothered by it, it worked for a long time.

As it became more common for people with gender dysphoria to transition from one gender to another (and of course, it's anything but truly common, still), a better word was needed for someone who was, like most people, not transgendered.

That word was CISGENDERED.  The prefix CIS has been the opposite of TRANS for ages.  Words using it having nothing to do with gender or sex include cisalpine, cismontane, cisatlantic, Cisjordan, cislunar, all opposites of words prefixed with TRANS.

CISGENDER is not a slur. The only way you can find it offensive is if you're offended by the need to distinguish people who are not transgendered from those who are.

And that's a very bigoted mindset.",26,neutral,0.672954797744751

"Well, this was sweet, cute, fun, and clever in how non-dad common phrases were given a dad spin.  But it just didn‚Äôt feel Simeon-y to me.  I love his puzzles for their how-did-he-think-of-that-and-pull-it-off themes.  This seemed too conventional for him.

So, when I saw in his notes that the concept he sent into the Times had a tricky gimmick, revealed in the last across answer, suddenly things felt right in the world.  But now I want to know what that tricky gimmick was.  Simeon!  Simeon!  Will you please chime in here???

Oh, I adored the clue ‚Äì [Demos for democracy, e.g.] ‚Äì for ROOT WORD (Hi, @Pezhead!).  And this puzzle reminded me of my dad, who was not a dad joke teller per se; in fact, he didn‚Äôt abide dad jokes very well.  But he continually came out with such funny non-dad-joke lines.

One example.  He was a nonapologetic carnivore; barbecued steaks were regularly on the dinner rotation.  He loved his meat.  He lived for it.  So, when I told him that vegetarians live longer than meat eaters, his face screwed up in bewilderment, and then, after a beat, he said, ‚ÄúMaybe it just SEEMS longer.‚Äù
