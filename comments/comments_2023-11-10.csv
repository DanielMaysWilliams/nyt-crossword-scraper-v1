Fun Friday puzzle! I took me the longest time to remember the “C” in PERNICIOUS and I learned a new definition for Davenport (I thought it was just a sofa).,0,positive,0.8745970726013184
"This was a struggle to the point where I was sure I’d gotten as far as I could without help, just one step away from checking Wordplay for hints, but I decided to run through the clues one last time. 

Found one possible answer and filled it in, which led to another possible answer and filling THAT in, and the dominoes kept falling until finally…voila.

Such is the beauty of crossword-puzzling.

"I somehow beat my average Friday time, but I had troubles in the NE so this didn’t feel like a breeze to me. Loved the FORT/flag misdirection, especially as someone who’s been on a date at Fort McHenry. I don’t talk to that dude anymore but I bought a harmonica at the gift shop. It was awesome!

This is an especially exciting day as I finally get to be “that guy” in the comments who’s never heard of a certain dynastic, multi-Grammy-winning artist considered a gimme by people in a different age group than my own. I spent a shameful amount of time trying to wrestle the 9-letter ROYALTIES into 7 squares whose down-crosses were NOT having it. But wait, there’s more! Even after settling on ROSANNE, I struggled to understand how this specific first name could be a music-industry slang term for “cash.” (Note that even though the subject was inaccessible to me, I am not accusing this of being too obscure a clue for the NYT Crossword! Hint hint!)

I know that country music and the Family Cash in general are one of my biggest musical blind spots, and I’m only a little familiar with Johnny Cash’s bigger hits. But when I was 13 my mother cancelled my Time-Life subscription to the “Singers and Songwriters of the 70s-80s” CD collection before I could even make it past 1978, so I think I am pretty much blameless here—apparently Rosanne was only 3 CDs away.

A conjecture: The trend of constructors filling grids with long expressions like MORETOCOME, YOUSHOULDNTHAVE, BELIKETHAT, HITTHEBOOKS, REALMATURE is actually making puzzles *easier* to solve.

"I've never heard of PISTOLES either, so the cross with BALL PIT was hard for me too.  I actually ran the alphabet before writing the P in  -- just to make sure I wouldn't blow the $100,000 First Prize* by doing something dumb.

"So many questions:
Did we really wear neon lothing back in the1980's? What I recall of the sartorial 80's: A b-52's concert at which more than one young lady  wore a Hefty® garabage bag, tied aroung the middle with a brightly colored belt--a surprisingly attractive look--""Don't look now, Robyn, but she's wearing your sack!""; oversized talking T-shirts which read ""Choose Life,"" ""Frankie says . . ,"" or something in Kanji--usually ""Kami kaze,"" but I had one which my nextdoor neighbor, a Japanese major, informed me read ""Fresh fruit""; vintage (i.e. thrift-store) overcoats for men, adorned at the lapel with an--equally vintage--woman's rhinestone broach; wearing clothing, and ordering gin-and tonics, because you knew they would fluoresce under the black light of a dance floor. Yes, I guess we also wore neon.

But I would never sauté green beans that hadn't been steamed, or at least blanched, first.  OK, well, I did, this past Monday, but just because I was rushed to get that order out, and back to Wordplay:-)
