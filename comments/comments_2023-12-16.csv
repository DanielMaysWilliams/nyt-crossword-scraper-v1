"A lot of REAL NEAT objections to content, form, and spelling today. My turn! Uncultured Americans always get this wrong but actually a single unit of pornography is a ‚Äúpornino,‚Äù while the plural (counted) form is ‚Äúpornini,‚Äù from the Italian.*

On that note, in the spirit of unity, I would like to propose a truce that ‚Äúthrouple‚Äù is how to spell it when you knowingly enter one, and ‚Äúthruple‚Äù is how to spell it when you find out you‚Äôre already in one. ‚ÄúThrupple,‚Äù however, will never be a thing. Stop trying to make ‚Äúthrupple‚Äù happen.

I always love content that pushes the envelope, but COLDPLAY was almost too much for me. I have two ears and a heart just like anyone else, but during the height of their fame I considered their music to be empty, emotionally manipulative fluff. The sudden reminder of how overplayed they were was jarring. But I can‚Äôt live this lie any longer. ‚ÄúViva La Vida‚Äù came on at the bar last week and I sang every word.

Today, I filled in the NW quickly, but once I got to the long diagonal section from the SW to the NE, it was hard going, in part because I was pretty sure that 20A was going to be Hatfield and 34D was hoTROD.

...will just say that today I won the bitzer prize. 62 day streak continues - my second longest ever. Can't go on much longer.

40a brought me back to my UP* hometown of Iron Mountain again. As a mining town, about half the population there was from northern Italy and the other half from Cornwall. So... Cornish PASTIES were a favorite treat up there. And.... CORNISHPASTY was an answer in one puzzle. 

*and - drifting way off topic, I happened to remember one of the more amusing advertisement slogans from way back then: 

""The best beer in the whole UP."" 

Think about it. I'm done.

This puzzle revealed itself to me very gradually with the corners so tightly sequestered that it was hard to find that breakthrough moment where the answers come flooding out and the puzzle seems to solve itself.  I was slowed by trying Hatfield and Montague before CAPULETS.  If I‚Äôd bothered to check the downs I‚Äôd have seen that the feuding family needed to end in S and I‚Äôd have saved myself some grief.  Oh well. But I got ‚Äòer done in the end.  And now I‚Äôm ready to begin the annual holiday bake-a-thon.,10,neutral,0.5183566212654114

"I liked most of this puzzle - some of the clues were witty and often fun, and I knew most of the answers. However, bits of the puzzle I did not enjoy at all, and I don't only mean the clue from which I learned the ultimate masters of mediocrity that are Coldplay managed to set a streaming record on Spotify.

Could somebody please explain 'Factory seconds': IRREGS? I suppose REGS refers to some regulations. But other than that I understand neither the clue (what does 'seconds' refer to?) nor the answer (IR?).

'Tiny type size' was a cruel way to clue AGATE. I've been using word processors and chosing font sizes for over 30 years, I've published a book and dozens of papers (and my parents published much more than that over 50 years), but I've never learned any typesetting lingo, either in Polish or in English.

Whatever PAM is, exactly, it crossing with something cryptically clued as 'geographical abbr.', and the latter crossing with the name of an artist I have never heard of was just annoying, especially for a foreign solver like me, not familiar with US food products (most of which are not sold in Europe, sometimes for food safety reasons) and not used to abbreviating everything and its mother. Polish does not even have an abbreviation for a mountain.

I had to enable autocheck and look up DARIN and IRREGS to complete the puzzle.",16,neutral,0.3492630124092102
