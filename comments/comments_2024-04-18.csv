"Kwong made a wonderful puzzle and I really enjoyed it, but I agree with the other commenters that the imprecise cluing kinda ruined it. We who love words think very precisely about what words are, so to see someone describe letters of the alphabet as ""words"" is really quite shocking.

"A difficult to suss out theme with obscure, Saturday level clues made this truly unenjoyable.

But my huge gripe was the clue for visitor from a faraway place. I refused to put in UFO until I had no choice, because this answer is completely inaccurate. An ET or alien is the visitor. A space ship is the vehicle in which they arrive. A UFO is anything seen by someone not wearing their glasses.

The only *acre on an ocean floor that I know is ""nacre, so I was able to figure out that the star in a clue could be a ""b"" or an ""n.""

I've said it before and I'll say it again.  Every time you think no one can come up with a completely original puzzle idea, someone does.

Right away I saw all the missing ""B""s and ""N""s in the clues.  I parsed them all perfectly.  But why those missing letters?  Would the thrice-made movie have the word ""missing"" in it?  Or ""vanished""?  Or ""disappears""?  And what could possibly tie together an N and a B?

Had my life depended on it, I could not have come up with the answer.

So A STAR IS BORN comes in and I'm told to parse.  And I parse away.  Parse, parse, parse.  As tar is born?  What the--?  And that's not six words.

"That was just right for a Thursday!  I didn't get the theme until ~ 95% complete, but ultimately decoding A Star is Born to read as A Star is B or N was essential to getting me the rest of the way home.",12,positive,0.9257988929748535
"I thoroughly enjoyed the solving puzzle, some clues made me laugh, and even more, I enjoyed reading Deb‚Äôs article, which is an equally valuable contribution IMHO. What more could one want for a bit of puzzle-entertainment at the end of a day. Thanks.",36,positive,0.9845227003097534
"B and N are not words. Would‚Äôve preferred the clue to suggest adding two spaces, and then i wouldn‚Äôt have been stuck figuring out which six actual words fit in so few letters.",70,negative,0.5304070115089417
"Wow, just wow. Could not figure this out. But when I did I was utterly blown away at the cleverness of the clues. Really wish I had seen it before I read the explanation but kudos for the *rillia*t execution.",58,positive,0.8577430844306946
Yuck. Just another sad puzzle that was easily solved with the crossing clues. No need to waste time trying to figure out the twisted premise.,7,negative,0.9367748498916626

I just read Deb‚Äôs column and I‚Äôm blown away by the revealed. Tremendous work!,9,positive,0.9762071967124939
"I just love a Thursday trick like this where the clue itself must be played with in order to figure out the answer. I caught on with MCCARTNEY. 

And how very impressive to find words where the pronunciation changes by adding a B or N to the beginning. I have to admit that today I learned that Ovid is pronounced Ahvid. 

Congratulations, David. Excellent puzzle!",16,positive,0.9475907683372498
"I had a ball with this one.  It took me a bit to figure out the gimmick. I entered THECRETANBULL, and just shrugged my shoulders.  Live and learn.  But I caught on to the trick when I had enough crosses to get MOTHEROFPEARL, and for once the trick was a critical help for me.  I now knew the asterisks need to be replaced by letters to get the correct clue.  I was stymied by the little box on the left central side of the puzzle, but once I realized that I needed to identify a (n)ascent stage for a bird, HATCHLING popped out and I had enough to get the little words in the box that had been vexing me.   I never actually got the revealer, but the correct letters to add were obvious enough.  I even managed a below average Thursday time.",7,positive,0.5950817465782166
"Maybe it's because I drove ten hours today from DC to Bloomington, Indiana, but the revealer was lost on me. I solved the puzzle by relying on the crosses.

Tuuuuuffffff puzzle! But I liked it.,4,positive,0.8313271403312683
"I got RIVIERA from crosses, didn't /think/ it got cold enough for Ice, then realized the asterisk was being used as a wildcard.  I got the rest of the theme clues pretty quickly then, but without realizing they were B OR N.  I misread ‚ÅéOvid as Corvid, in fact, and was trying to think of a crow in Greek mythology. D'oh! to use a popular bit of crosswordese.",15,neutral,0.7068440914154053
"Frustration increasing this week. These puzzles have been very sloppy. ""B"" and ""N"" are not words. I realized that Ice was meant to be Nice, and finished the puzzle from there, but I shouldn't have needed this column to explain what was meant by 6 words",93,negative,0.8803825378417969

Not sure if this was brilliant or nutty.  Sorry.",5,neutral,0.5148133039474487
Wanted to chime in and say that I really enjoyed this one. Just challenging enough overall and the reveal of the 6 words was a cute trick.,20,positive,0.9832800626754761

"So, my head is around 5 to 6 feet off the ground. This theme was, conservatively, 200 feet over my head. I solved this thing well under average, but getting the theme? Haha, no. Then again, I'm constantly bewildered by magic, so this should be no surprise.",16,neutral,0.4805307388305664
"When I got 23A (the only thing that made sense once I had a bunch of crosses), the NACRE twist occurred to me, but then I couldn't make sense of things like NALLOT or NOVINE, so I just shrugged and charged ahead with guessing the rest of the theme entries. And I really didn't understand the theme for a while after finishing (which is the way I prefer these things to work out) because I couldn't reparse 63A (kept trying to make it start with AS). But then it clicked. Very nice.",3,neutral,0.6824519038200378
"I finished the puzzle, checked the missing letters, said ""a star is born... What? Six words? ... OH! A star is ""B"" OR ""N."" 

At that moment I felt as if the constructor elbowed my side and said, ""get it?? B OR N?? They replace the stars in the clues! Hahahaha!!!!"" 

And I have that half smile, half eye roll that's the reaction to all great dad jokes.",61,neutral,0.4877523183822632

Not a fan.",82,negative,0.9468433856964111
"Fun puzzle. I got it but did so without understanding the ""trick"".  Also, I finished the puzzle and all of the squares are filled correctly, but it is still marked as not being correct. Any ideas? I checked it with the PDF several times. I'll give it another check, but if anyone else has had this problem let me know.",2,positive,0.6515111923217773
Brilliant if one regards a B and an N as words. However it turns into a quick solve.,4,positive,0.7910309433937073
"What a fun theme! I did have to come to the column to figure out what it was, but after I saw how to parse the theme entry into six words, everything fell into place. 

My favorite entry though was 70A, as it brought me back to elementary school. I remember when pogs were briefly all the rage among my peers. I never got into them myself, but I still have the one I acquired in those days and it makes me smile when I see it.",8,positive,0.9620164036750793

"Really really clever. I figured out the trick easily enough‚Äîa missing letter where the asterisk was‚Äîwhich made it pretty easy to guess the themes, but I love a theme where you can‚Äôt wait to see what the revealer would be and this one didn‚Äôt disappoint. A quick solve but extremely fun.
