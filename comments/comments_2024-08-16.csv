"@Barry Ancona I wanted to acknowledge your reply to my Wednesday comment, but went back after the comments were closed and I am not sure where else to post it.  I just finished Fridays crossword and it‚Äôs Saturday morning here so needless to say I struggled with Thursday and Friday and I am a bit behind! üòÖ
Anyway, I wanted to reply to the following: 

https://www.nytimes.com/shared/comment/415nmm?rsrc=cshare&smid=url-share

Thank you for taking the time to reply and I do see your point üôÇ 

Now, I am hoping you (or anyone else willing)  can help me with a couple general crossword questions I have, as you seem to be very experienced and willing to help . I am only a month or two into doing the NYT Crosswords. 

1. What is/are the emus that people reference in their comments? 

2. When a constructor does make an error, such as with the Purina/Alpo clue, have you seen it ever be acknowledged or explained by either the NYT Crossword staff or the constructor?

It felt like a really SPUNK(y) one to me and I dig it!  (Goodness, does that make me a HOER!?  üòÇ )

The SW was a bit of struggle for me but the rest came in swimmingly.

One of those easy/hard puzzles that I love, and I'm just sorry it's OVA.  Will there be complaints? IT DEPENDS‚ÄîSTAY TUNED.

The constructor (SEE ABOVE) did a terrific job.  Thank you so much, and keep them coming.",63,positive,0.391337126493454
"Fast but fun. I too liked the ZEN GARDEN clue, and the Z was enough to convince me that the movie quote had to be ZOOLANDER. (That‚Äôs a movie we didn‚Äôt get very far with.)

By the time I saw the clue for ELEVEN, I already had enough letters to get the answer without reading the clue. That was a little disappointing, because ‚Äúhendecagon‚Äù was an answer in the Newsday Saturday Stumper about a month ago, and I don‚Äôt think I had heard it before then.

Thanks, Ms Hawkins!",11,positive,0.9166429042816162
"Breezed through that for a Friday PB! It‚Äôs always fun when the long clues just snap in with little help. Though getting Zoolander off the bat helped with the entire bottom. ‚ÄúWhat is this, a puzzle for ants?!‚Äù",20,positive,0.9159412980079651
"Challenging, and some interesting misdirects‚ÄîI had
SCARE and SCOOT instead of SPOOK and SPLIT, which oddly fit, which let me try SPORKS for the Libby offering (I was thinking of the canned food company, maybe they sometimes include plastic utensils?) And of course ART instead of AIR so that corner took a lot of manipulating. Also oddly DELAY(S) could work instead of AVERT or DETERS (and of course DEFERS). And RUCKUS instead of RACKET. So all in all I was flummoxed for a bit. But fun once I sorted it all out.",16,neutral,0.4957152307033539
"Haven‚Äôt done the xwords in a while. I thought I had no chance with this one.  Very little progress after 10 minutes. Then somehow COMTE popped into my head (uh, I think that‚Äôs a cheese?). 
Then the bottom somehow filled in. 

The top half was going nowhere. And then, even though I thought I went through every clue 10 times, somehow, I realized I never read the clue ‚ÄúShowrunner Rhimes‚Äù.  But somehow,  20 minutes in, I finally saw the clue. And that‚Äôs all I needed to scream through the top half.  

I can‚Äôt be the only one this happens to.  You go through all the acid and down cores multiple times, but late in the some, you see a clue you somehow skipped like 5 times. But it is a critical gimme that unlocks the puzzle. 

So I guess proper nouns saved me. COMTE and SHONDA. 

very nice Friday. The two vertical spanners were great. I alleviated the three S long entries: SEEABOVE, SELLSSHORT,  STAYTUNED. 
Maybe a Friday + / Saturday -



Thanks for the puzzle",17,negative,0.6004297137260437
Just the right number of misdirects and some great cluing and fill. The perfect Friday puzzle.,50,positive,0.8370622992515564
"EMBELLISH instead of EMBROIDER had me tripped up for a while. This puzzle felt hard not when I was done I was 12 minutes under my average (but then, I have so far to fall...)",13,negative,0.8056734800338745
"Kate, I appreciated your puzzle very much.  I couldn‚Äôt do it without a bunch of extra work. But that work flowed well. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. 

I LONGED to finish this quickly. It was ALL√Å ALPS and your DIRECTIVES were pleasantly misleading.  The only clue I felt was a bit off was 55 across.  A piece of eight is a nib of a Spanish Real. The peso was a term Mexicans used for the Spanish Real.",6,positive,0.8942393660545349
Lovely puzzle Kate. Took me a good while to gain any traction in it.,10,positive,0.9609708786010742
"I breezed through this airy puzzle as if I, rather than AIR, were inspired, and finished in a faster than usual Friday time.  I had the unknowing help of my art conservator daughter, thanks to whom I knew about Cindy SHERMAN, and my nephew, thanks to whom I knew ZOOLANDER, because when he was young we watched the movie together and he used to do a fair imitation of Ben Stiller‚Äôs blue steel look.  I thank myself for remembering that hendecagon relates to ELEVEN.  And last, but not least, I thank the crosses for teaching me that MONACO is the most densely populated country in Europe.  A fun puzzle that seemed much harder than it turned out to be.",17,positive,0.7948015928268433

"In the Thursday comments, someone asked why the column was titled ""Where Lines May Be Drawn in the Sand"".  No one knew for sure.

Now we know.

"I found this one to be on the tough side.  I took a few minutes longer than my average, which is quite unusual these days.  I thought it could have been a Saturday.

But I am aware that I'm unusually tired tonight.  That might have something to do with it.

But Kate Hawkins always produces a top-quality puzzle, so I knew it would be fair and doable.  And it was.",22,negative,0.5950709581375122
