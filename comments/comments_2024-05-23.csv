"as someone who’s hair is currently in BOXBRAIDS to avoid getting up extra early to do it before my 830s, I adored this puzzle! I actually managed to figure out a Thursday theme!!!! (well ~kinda~ bc I “unbraided” the entries on the downs, THEN noticed the acrosses were weird and had to go back.) but that didn’t stop me from hyping myself up because I made halfway before even opening the wordplay!!!! I even managed to avoid ye olde ECG vs EKG debacle! 🤩 my recent obsession with crosswording to get through a boring lecture is paying off (don’t worry, my grades are great as well 😌)

still had a few look-ups— one day I’ll learn every achievement of Mr T and these various celebs of before my time but for now I gotta go to class.
