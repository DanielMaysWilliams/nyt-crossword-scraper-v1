If it wasn't GREEN SALAD, surely it was GREEK SALAD, although that would be pushing it (spinach? dolmades?). Trying to recall whether I have ever heard the phrase FRESH SALAD in my life, I have to say no.

Never heard of EchoDot, so that corner remained only partly filled in.

SOOT is an abstract noun. Constructors need to respect those more.

SW also had issues. I ""knew"" that what should have been INQUIRY was INQUESTS and didn't erase when I should have. I was confident about LOUNGEWEAR, but IS BIG didn't occur to me; the closest I got was IS SET. 

Never heard of a rapper called Warren G., so that mostly didn't happen. The rappers and pop stars and their so-called songs are becoming increasing deterrents to filling in crosswords. I would really like to know who The Times thinks its readers are or ever will be.

The rabbit holes have been a siren's song from the time I worked in the library reference department of a major university (not UCB, UTA), and the solid pleasure of exploring a source has never left me; googling or wikipedia-ing is an extension of wandering through a card catalog or roaming the stacks in search of an answer to a question—sometimes important, sometimes trivial.

"My personal groans in today's puzzle: 

LALA was the last to fall for me. When I plug my ears to show I'm not listening, there are at least four LA's in there! So a [doubled] would have made more sense, IMHO.

No graphic designer would *ever* use CLIP ART as a shortcut -- what an insult to a profession that already struggles with the assumption that ""anyone can do it"". Stock images, sure... But most if not all designers have nothing but distain for Microsoft. And yes, I know I'm suffering from ""too close syndrome"", but so be it...

No idea why Coach was in quotes. Clever wordplay just on its own, and the quotes for me implied a title, e.g., the old tv show. SMH.

Really wanted ""athleisure"" for the joggers. OMEN was a very clever example of that type of clue. Not sure of all the fuss in the comments about FRESH SALAD: [just in time for dinner] works for me! 

As for INEZ, I know I just solved a NYTXD with this spelling! I only did one puzzle in the archives this week (can't remember which). So if no one else recalls it as a recent entry, perhaps it was back to 2022?",10,neutral,0.4844214618206024

"This was very tough. After the first pass I had almost nothing, and some of that was wrong. It didn't get much better after that.

When I got to 20D, I thought I would have a gimme. Right away I put in ROC (Rest of Canada) an expression used often in Québec (by both anglophones and francophones) for Ontario and any other province or territory that is not Québec. I did think it was odd though to find ROC in a NYT puzzle. LAC is a much better answer.",9,negative,0.6640843749046326
"For my money, this was the best Saturday puzzle in a long time. Absolutely great clueing, reminiscent of (though not anywhere near as difficult as) the old Saturdays (which I personally know only from the archives).

In other words, there will be tons of comments about how this was “just a slog”, “too clever by half”, “challenging but not in a good way”, etc. And probably a fair bit of personal criticism of the constructor. It’s like clockwork!

ZTILE and LAC were a couple of my favorites…despite the fact that I lost a BLUE amount of time due to confidently entering INES for 7D on my first pass…and kept it there without reexamination for a solid ~45 minutes.

"This was a gratifyingly tough puzzle worthy of a Saturday slot. The top right was simply opaque to me for a very long go.

As with others, the [10-point] clue was really baffling. Knowing that both historical and modern spellings of the name range from Ines, Inez, Ynes, to Ynez, I had just put the “ne” in and, following my usual practice, moved on. Then the T appeared, so, as with others, I put the S in, thinking ZT- was a no-go. Then came the I and the L, and I was left thinking,
STIL_, the blank would have to be a six-point letter, and there is no 6-point letter in Scrabble! Oof, what a fight I had until the dook was undone.

"Interesting comments.  I didn't think this was all that bad, or all that hard really.  He threw us an emu right at the top.

Nobody else tried to fill in Tim Walz for ""Coach"" in quotes?  :)

My issues included getting stuck with ""stile"" because I spelled the name ""Ines"", not knowing you can have galop with one L (rebus? I wondered) or much about Oklahoma OK, and wanting fresh basil instead of salad.

Other than that, and apparently bucking the consensus, I think I actually enjoyed this one.  It was hard but wrangleable.  Favorite was ""nihilo"" only because I like the sound of the phrase.  I could SO do without hearing the icky phrase ""vape juice"" ever again though....

"For a long time while glacially solving this puzzle, I was uncomfortably aware of how easy it would be for any creator to make a puzzle that would be virtually impossible for almost anyone on earth to solve, especially me with my limited life experience and knowledge. Instead, at the NYT they somehow apply their skills all around that knife-edge of pretty easy to pretty darned hard to ‘will I ever figure this out, woof just barely’ (like today!), to the occasional ‘ok, I'm in over my head, but I’ll get you next time.” And that for people from just about all over the place.

I solved the puzzle in about one minute less than my average, using my phone rather than my more usual desktop, and thought some of the clues were a bit challenging, but none too hard or unfair.

When you reach a certain level of proficiency, though, you know some of the things that give newer solvers trouble. It doesn’t occur to the experienced solver that this is the case unless they give it some thought.  

If you are a newer solver, keep in mind that this is just a tough Saturday, and you might just not be ready for it.  It’s not a bad puzzle because you can’t solve it.  In five years, you may love a puzzle like this one.",16,neutral,0.48944249749183655

Things I know in advance.  There will be no junk in the grid.  None, because Sam.  There will be tons of NYT debut answers, which means my brain will get to improvise.  There will be many tough clues requiring multiple visits.  

And so it was.  I’d be working in one quadrant, when I’d peek into another and suddenly see an answer that had eluded me.  It might beget yet another or even a mini-splat of answers until boom I’d hit the wall of stuckness once again.

Then back to the sweet work of overcoming the vacuum. My brain, throughout, spinning like a gyroscope, inquiring, working behind the scenes, looking at clue words suspiciously, gambling on guesses, leaping at successes.  The Ezersky experience.

And NYT answer debuts?  Fifteen!  Fifteen!  A grid popping with freshness. So many lovely debuts, too, such a HAIL A CAB, IS BIG, LOUNGEWEAR, SAKE BAR, YAS QUEEN. Crossnerd me calculated that in the first five columns of the grid, three-quarters of the letters belonged to debut answers.  Wow!

I've never played Scrabble), ECHODOT (the only Amazon device I recognize is Kindle), ELLER (yeah, it probably featured in a million puzzles before, but I care not for musicals so I have no motivation to remember anything about them) and VCMONEY - the latter annoyed me, personally, because I know of venture capital, but I've never seen it refered to as what was required today. ADDINS rather than ADDoNS were a bit cruel, but CLoPART was not a feature of Microsoft Word  and CLIPART was so I spotted the mistake.

I also broke down and looked up 1A when I had almost all of the letters there: VAPE_UIC_. I know nothing about vaping, neither in English nor in Polish. I had no idea JAG would be the answer to ""bender"" (could somebody please explain that? I still don't get it), and ENSILE is just weird and I've never encountered it before.

Still, I found this puzzle easier than yesterday's - no autocheck needed today.",14,neutral,0.45526623725891113

I mean … wha …  inside joke with yourself - cool.  

I will jump Apple News new crossword section they keep throwing at me. Thanks for precisely 20 minutes ridiculousness.",11,negative,0.3573949635028839
"I can finish Fri/Sat puzzles about 1 out of 3 times without any lookups.
I did a pass on this one and got 2 probablys and 5 maybes.
Second pass got one more maybe. At this point I asked myself ""Is this a Sam E puzzle?"" And yes, it was.
I have never been on the same wavelength as Sam. I do the Spelling Bee every day and am often annoyed at the words he excludes and the ""words"" he includes.
So knowing I would not have much of a chance, I pulled all the hints from Wordplay, and still got next to nothing. Then I did a reveal, saw the answers, and moved on. Glad I did. A few clever bits, but mostly too clever by half. This is why I never get too attached to my streaks. Sam is a clever guy but his mind is wired differently from mine.",102,neutral,0.6396064162254333
"A tough one for me in the NE corner, partly because I had gREenSALAD, which didn't really fit the clue, and ENSILo. (I'm sure that the Amazon oCHODOT must be version 8 in Mexico.) I put the puzzle away for a while, then came back and said ""Okay, this has to be LAO and this has to be ROOTS"" and finally got LALA and was able to proceed from there.",18,neutral,0.4817230701446533

"I needed ALL the answers provided in today's column to give me any hope of breaking this puzzle. I had just finished patting myself on the back for whizzing through yesterday's crossword, praising myself for being ""on the same wavelength"" as the constructor. No coinciding wavelengths today, sadly. It was just too difficult for me. Thank goodness for this article, or I'd have been lost.",31,neutral,0.42392662167549133
"My first pass fill (only one) was Eller.  It got a lot harder after that, until it got a bit easier, and the fills finally started emerging. I had to trust that AMNESIC was really a word (I knew what Mr. Peck's problem was); I misspelled GAL( l )OP, then realized that the clue might be plural; ditched stencil for CLIP ART; IS BIG and JET gave me the Nimitz quote; and so on.  I had to come to the column for my last entry, corrected INEs to INEZ, and there was the Z TILE (beautiful).  

YAS, Sam, that was some puzzle.  I would say that practice makes perfect, and you seem to be proving that.  I'm trusting that you have more in your pocket than just ONE PLEASE.",13,neutral,0.5857447981834412
"Toughie.  

How legitimate is my solving streak, really, when I have a bunch of personal Naticks and just run the alphabet/ educated guesses on INEZ, YASQUEEN and GALOPS?

“Reach for the cars?”  HAIL A CAB

“Line outside a box office”  ONE PLEASE 

“It moves with traffic, in  brief”  ETA

YASQUEEN!! Loved it first then read the byline…of course it was a cut above.,7,positive,0.9872090816497803
"From VAPEJUICE to STOPWATCH (great clue BTW)I found this really tough. I had Ines instead of INEZ, and just couldn’t get the 10 point score until my Scrabble brain kicked in.  The whole puzzle was like that - a lot of head scratching eventually followed by a brief burst of inspiration, but I never got to the point where it all came together in a rush as most puzzles seem to.  Last to fall was the NE, where VCMONEY, ARCTICA, and YASQUEEN eluded me until the very end.  This was a worthy Saturday in my book.  I expect a fair amount of griping as the comments roll in.",11,negative,0.5835275650024414

"I put in INEZ immediately, and then when I got COTTA right after, I decided it had to be the variant INES because what word starts with ZT?

That’s why you have to be flexible with these things.
