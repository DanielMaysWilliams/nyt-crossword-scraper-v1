"Great fun puzzle!  I got stuck on my hard headed insistence on ""opera stage"".  When I gave up on it, everything in that northeast corner flowed.  I enjoyed working this puzzle. It was at the just perfect level of difficulty for my current abilities. The puns and wordplay were in my wheelhouse, and the clues were solid! 

I've been working my way back over the last month from a grueling case of spring COVID.  I got it before I could get the vaccine.  I've been using the NYT word games as a gauge of my healing from the fatigue and brain fog.  This puzzle was the first that I could stay with and solve evenly. Thank you NYTs for your wonderful games!  At my age, these games are more than just fun for me, but a daily workout for my brain.

On the always-present “puzzle difficulty level” topic: I think the serious and long-time puzzlers who say fairly regularly here that puzzles are getting faster, have a strong point. 

I started solving (on iPad) about six years ago or so. I do the current puzzles daily, and don’t look up answers. I am not very fast. I am also working back through the archives, doing almost all Wed through Sun puzzles, and sometimes Mon and Tues. Currently in October 2015. For archives, I am willing but reluctant to consult Google. In the past six months or so, almost every “current” puzzle has been below my daily average time, and almost every archive puzzle is near or above it. Think about bell curves, and running averages as you consider these facts, not one puzzle, not even today’s. Also consider that 2015 was closer to my pop cultural sweet spot than is today (I’m “still 59” for the first time).

I don’t personally mind that the puzzles are getting easier. But I would say there is good evidence that they are. And yeah, I enjoy some chewier ones. I would welcome a change to keep Fri and Sat a bit harder on average, such as that suggested below by Barry Ancona, or a similar idea.

I hope to never be this long-winded again. And if the NYT already knows all our timing numbers, as I just now imagined might be the case, then what a total waste of wind!!",9,positive,0.7339391112327576

"This morning is my last of a week of vacation Up North (which RiA would hardly consider ""north"")--A beautiful, cool, sunny morning: A kayak ride around the lake, followed by a breakfast on the deck of cherry pie, coffee, and a Robyn Weintraub Friday puzzle! Can life get any better?

Curiously, as I was kayaking around the lake, I spotted a family of Canada geese, parents with seven goslings; and another couple walking on shore with only one gosling. ""Did they only have one chick, or were the rest eaten by predators, I wonder? Do they feel sad that they only have one? Do the others brag that they've been so prolific?"" And that got me thinking about Niobe, daughter of Tantalus, and her fatal hybris; I believe that, in the end, she was metamorphosed into a boulder which seeped water--a specific boulder (but where?) which Pausanias--the Fodor of the 2nd c--records having visited.

"I know when I do one of Robyn’s puzzles I will light up with smiles.  Her puzzles are gifts, filled with play, with I-can-relate-to-that colloquialisms, and with fun-to-crack riddles.  

Often overlooked is her construction skill.  Look at the answers in the grid.  Where’s any ugliness?  Where?  On a 72-word puzzle with a mere 30 black squares, do you know how difficult this is to achieve?  I gaze at the filled grid and feel peaceful.

Robyn is about the longs (answers of eight letters or more).  There are 12 in this puzzle.  Today, my three favorite answers were longs – INSIDE JOBS, THAT’S THE SPOT, and DON’T REMIND ME.  The first two are NYT debut answers, and the third has only appeared once in all the major crossword venues.  Wow!

Plus, wit and originality in cluing.  For instance, ABSENT has appeared a hundred times in the major venues, often clued [Not in class].  But Robyn added a twist never before used, with her terrific misdirecting [Not in English, say].

Oh, I also liked the lovely serendipities today – the three rare-in-crosswords 5-letter semordnilaps (SPANS, SLOOP, SMART), and the kitchen-y PuzzPair© cross of STEAM TABLE with a “fryer” homophone (FRIAR).

"A Weintraubian Friday.

I was actually momentarily bummed. 

Last night, we were celebrating, 
and I (may or may not) have 
been *sipping* limoncello spritzers.

So, when I saw her name, I lit up 
(in a sad, spinny-headed way), 
but thought I should hydrate, 
and wait until I could savor it.

Puh. Leeze.
Like I’m gonna wait. 
In the same way I said, “ no thanks to the fourth(?) spritzer.

I dove in.
I pounded my white tea,
rubbed the puffy regret from my eyes, 
and dug in.

The magic of Robyn’s puzzles is that they are
*not* easy. 
But they pretend to be.

They're tricky.
They zig. 
They zag!
A long clue for a long answer could make you 
slow down, hack away at the crosses, 
furrow your brow…

But with her puzzles, you go with your gut.
And she knows what you’re gonna think.
And it’s right.

It’s like you were there, constructing with her, 
and vaguely remember the answers.

I had no idea who the queen with 47 letters in her name was,
but didn’t we all just plop in THAI?

Witchcraft, is what it is.
Weintraubian witchcraft.

And more tea.
