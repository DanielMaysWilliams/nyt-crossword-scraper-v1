"In anticipation of the daily question, 
I am posting in advance 
the answer provided years ago 
by our esteemed columnist and senior staff editor.


Are the emus real?
Of course they’re real. The emus used to run this entire operation, and readers occasionally witnessed their handiwork when something broke down.

Nowadays, with the advent of modern technology, they are mostly retired. They still live in a large nest in the Legal department, however, and they help Gameplay by sniffing out off-color comments and eating the surplus black-and-white squares.

"Fast and fun. Thanks, Ms. Weintraub! 

Thanks, Deb, Caitlin, and Sam for consistently entertaining columns. Deb, you almost had me believing that you thought “Raspberry relative” and RUBY refer to low-cost computers and programming languages.",44,positive,0.9399189949035645
"First of all, Deb, happy new year back at you, and DL & SC, too. I am a big admirer of your bonhomie, sharpness and leadership, and you have always been willing to engage with us here in the peanut gallery, as witness your lively exchanges with Steve L. yesterday (and I'm an admirer of Steve for always hangin' in there, for good or ill -- Steve, baby, you have a fine fickle 'veinticuatro too!). I thought the addition of Sam Corbin to the team really completed your approach: Caitlin's analytic mind and linguistic guru-ness, Sam's sense of the play and poetry in language, and your wise, funny, patiently explaining it all for the umpteenth time, but always finding a new way to do so, and your inclusiveness and big tent leadership, I feel like we live in a golden age. 

As for ruby and raspberry, I don't think you need to delve that deep for a connection; they're related colors, shades of dark red, that connection was immediate for me. 

Liked this puzzle so much, the neat twists and turns. I didn't bother looking at who authored this puzzle before solving, and must confess that at the end of it, I was winded but not particularly exhilarated, and I didn't think to myself, this bears all the signs of a Weintraub. So I ask you, one and all, could you identify this as a Weintraub if you didn't know it was by her? Because I couldn't.",60,positive,0.9635129570960999
"Deb,

It seems to me that the
RUBY - Raspberry connection
(other than just sharing redness)
predates computer programs:
