"Oh man. I had KOOLAID in 2D for the longest time and it totally ate me up. Might actually need a MARTINI after this. 

Wonderful Friday. My only gripe is 49A. What a truly horrible clue.",2,negative,0.8273053169250488
Loved this and was totally on the same wave as the constructor.  CHACHASLIDE and TWICEASNICE were gimmies for me which worked out great.  And GETTHESCOOP was my first guess for 32 across and everything just flowed in around those long stretches. The SW gave me a little trouble because of ONTHREE.  I deleted and reentered so many answers in that section before settling on the set that got the music but I laughed at my brain for getting on distracted on that one instead of just letting the crosses do their job.,5,positive,0.9673896431922913

"Another very enjoyable puzzle day! Solved at just a bit under my Friday average but without any lookups or other helps, though I came close a couple of times. My resolve to solve more and more without any help (including end of week) is semi-mulish, I suppose. 

Super proud of myself for figuring out STETS. Not right away, I first thought of baseball or asking for a date or some such but then I remembered STET as another word I learned through crosswords. It feels good to be picking up more and more of these!! Huzzah!!

Favorite clues/entries: the aforementioned STETS, pressed for cash for ATM, kept in the loop for BELT,  Mac maker for KRAFT, part of a clutch for CHICK (new one for me!), They bring a lot to the table for waiters... but really, I liked it all! Felt fun and fresh!  

I desperately wanted SCOOP du jour for 32A, even though it didn't make sense with the clue. 

I didn't understand SYN until Sam explained, which puts it in with my list of favorite clues. I love good tricky word play like that! 

Full disclosure: Kraft mac is my primary comfort food guilty pleasure from childhood. Sometimes I want mac and cheese.. maybe with lobster or gourmet cheese, etc., and sometimes only KRAFT and it's weird orange powdery stuff will do! 

Lastly, PLEASE DO make me a MARTINI‚Äîup with a twist (don't even think about olives while shaking it)... I'M SURE it's 5 o'clock somewhere! (Actually, I think it is just about five for many of you, so get yourself shaking!!) üç∏Cheers, all!üç∏",9,positive,0.9426044225692749

A few freeway exits further (closer to Dayton), offered to take me east to Sydney, west to Versailles. I'll guess that the latter rhymes with ""Impales.""

I love a puzzle with, to me,  unknowables ‚Äì TILS like STIMMING‚Äì, that the crosses come to stitch together seamlessly. 

And I absolutely love a puzzle that points out my cultural black holes (AENEAS), deflating me, but then rewards me when the light easily FLICKS on (ANITA Garibaldi,) letting me feel, for a second, oh-so-proud.

"Congratulations on your solo NYT debut, Ms Lynch!

The puzzle was mostly a typical Friday in terms of difficulty.

And then I had STARTER seTS at 16D, making it impossible to see the logical 39A SKI (which should have been a gimme, since skiing is one of my favorite things in life).

It took until this morning to understand how 54A ON THREE fits ‚ÄúI‚Äôll count us in.‚Äù I love music but have no experience making it. I got ON THREE from the letter pattern, but took it out at least once because it didn‚Äôt seem to fit the clue.

"A tough, well-clued ""keep the faith"" puzzle that I solved slowly and INTRACTABLY -- i.e. ""with mulish resolve.""  I couldn't for the life of me gain entry to the NW and was tempted to cheat on Mrs. Garibaldi -- but overcame the impulse. I finished with no cheats, and in what I imagine was a slow-ish time, though I never keep track of such things.

My entry points were all the way over on the right: my only-from-crosswords-friend, Cousin ITT and BUSES-to-BLOBS.  From this paltry beginning, a solve did I make.

I guessed that the drink it ""up"" clue at 2D would be an alcoholic drink of some kind -- but the cutesy clue is wrong.  The First Rule of ordering a drink is to make sure nothing can go wrong -- not from the bartender and not from your host.  Your job is to be very clear about what you'd like.  And the correct term for a drink with no ice is ""straight up"".  Some drink preparers may understand ""up"" used alone and some may not.  Why take the chance that your drink might be watered down?

As your hostess, I would check to make sure.  ""You did mean straight up, right?""  But at a very busy bar, you can't be too careful.

Two answers that were complete Greek to me:  STIMMING and CHACHASLIDE. But everything else was quite familiar -- its difficulty level derived from tough cluing rather than arcane fill.  I thought this was an excellent puzzle.",11,neutral,0.638917088508606

I‚Äôve never heard of chachaslide and my research seems to say it replaced the hokey-pokey and the funky chicken somewhere along the line. As for Spanish, I never took the language in school, so differences in idiomatic expressions are way beyond me. Strategy and tactics are definitely not synonymous but reflect the level of planning of military and other operations. 

None of this should be read as a criticism of the constructor, but my guess is that the editorial team is really coming to the unfortunate natural conclusion of their usefulness by daring each other to offer more and more obscure and opaque clues.",1,negative,0.5173004269599915

"Well, two puzzles into the Times, Carolyn has shown, IMO, that she has the Knack ‚Äì the talent to craft a high-level, satisfying-to-complete puzzle.  

Time and again, in this puzzle, I had to do what my brain loves to do ‚Äì guess.  One example: In the NW, I had the MM of STIMMING (which I got from LIMA and ATM), so I guessed that it ended in ING, given its clue.  That G, made me think GET for [Score a journalistic coup], which spontaneously begat GET THE SCOOP in an explosion of rapture.

Pings like that are among the highest delicacies in Crosswords.

All in a setting of spark.  This puzzle pulsed with spark, with 12 answers never seen in the Times before, including ‚Äì get this ‚Äì all six answers of the crossing triples stacks!  Wow! 

Original and devilish clues as well.  Example: ATM has been in the major outlets more than 500 times, but never clued using ‚Äúpressed for cash‚Äù in its clue.  Example: [Lacking, for short: Abbr.] for SYN.  Hah!

Throw in lovely serendipities, such as a backward ERA and an anagrammed ERAS (from SERA) in the puzzle with SWIFTIES, and the rare-in-crosswords five-letter palindrome (STETS), and this creation was simply a pastiche of pleasure.

"I thought for sure that ""With mulish resolve"" was gonna be ""ASSertively.""

Also, in the version of the Iliad I have here, under orders from Zeus, Apollo goads Aeneas into fighting Achilles. This is late in the book and Achilles has been knocking down Trojans like they are so many bowling pins. Aeneas starts losing badly and earns a RED CARD by trying to stamp on Achilles' heel and is tossed out of the game by Poseidon.  

(Actually, Achilles' fatal weakness -- his heel -- which was because that was where his mother held him when she dipped him into the River Styx, rendering him invulnerable except for that one spot -- is never mentioned in The Iliad - fun fact!)

(Also, the sun god Apollo was born in circumstances metaphorically like a solar nebula: on the ""floating island"" of Delos in the middle of the sea -- Hera's curse prevented Apollo's mother -- one of Zeus's flings -- from giving birth ""on earth"" and Delos was the perfect loophole. After Apollo and Artemis were born, the gods attached Delos to the bottom of the sea.)

I agree with others about the ""flow"" of this grid, one of those ineffable qualities that only the best puzzles have.",16,neutral,0.6097185015678406
"I‚Äôve never been to (ei)the(r) city, so no insult intended, but as I gaze above the solar nebula, I think I can just make out the Lima shack belt.

Fun puzzle! ‚Ä¶ but suddenly overcome with a desire for an ice cream cone.",5,neutral,0.627305269241333
"Terrific puzzle for any day of the week, Carolyn, with a beautiful grid. 
And thanks, Sam, for inserting the very funny SNL/John Mulaney CHA CHA SLIDE skit into your column. Having seen that skit is the only reason I knew that entry with no crosses.
(Carolyn, it would have been extra fun if you had  clued ANITA to Baker.)",6,positive,0.964695394039154
"Fun Friday puzzle! 15A, 34A and 19D were great clues and congrats on the solo debut.",2,positive,0.9896979928016663
"The name for Crisco, the original seed oil, was derived from ""crystalized cottonseed oil."" (Today its main ingredient is soybean oil.) It was pitched as a healthier alternative to lard, as most other seed oils are today. As 7A advises, Crisco was initially created for soap making.",13,neutral,0.8314589262008667
"My experience with this puzzle is that it is beautiful.  

The black squares form 2 sets of 4 like items, symmetrically placed.  Very pleasing to look at.  And once completed, even more so.  The shape supports the experience of viewing the interconnectedness of words that should have nothing in common, but somehow blend together gently and naturally.  Nothing seems forced.  There is a flow to it. 

With some groups and communities of people, I have experienced the same.  Reading the constructor‚Äôs thoughtful comments, it is no surprise that she can offer this experience of interconnectedness and flow in her creation.",18,positive,0.9685733914375305
"Congratulations on your solo debut, Carolyn.  With very little glue and many debuts, it felt super fresh.  The crossword staple STETs was very cleverly clued [Doesn't strike out, say] and it was nice to see great words like INTRACTABLY and SOLAR NEBULA make their first appearances.  Come back soon!",24,positive,0.9817728400230408
"A great variety of entries and fun clues.  My favorite was 47A, (possibly because I got it straight away. ) I also liked the nice comment that Carolyn made about Lewis who always writes such an excellent comment.",26,positive,0.9841193556785583
"Given that this column appeared in the wee hours, by an author who doesn‚Äôt usually write about Friday puzzles, and with a hastier feel than we are used to seeing from Sam Corbin, I just want to say that I hope that Deb Amlen is all right.",26,neutral,0.7376168370246887
"Unlike last Friday, this puzzle was appropriately hard.  I really liked.   My thanks to the editors and Ms  Lynch.",5,positive,0.9788915514945984
"Congrats, Carolyn. Most enjoyable and some great clues. Never heard of 19D so delighted to get this with the crossings. Loved the symmetry of 23A and 43A. Thank you!",5,positive,0.988148033618927
"from a far away country with no Spanish knowledge or geographical knowledge of the western world, and I completed this with no lookups and a gold star at 25mins. The long clues weren't difficult to me, and I felt like I was on the same wavelength as the constructor it's crazy. Haven't seen STIMMING before but love it's inclusion here. Overall, didn't know a good fraction of the words here but hella clever clueing allowed me to suss them out with the crosses!",44,positive,0.8426221013069153
"I really loved this puzzle. It had great flow and fresh clues and answers. Maybe, maybe a tad easy for a Friday but I thoroughly enjoyed my short time spent with it. Congrats on your solo debut Carolyn!",14,positive,0.9886112809181213
