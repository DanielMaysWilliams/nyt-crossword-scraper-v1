But I took piano lessons and I know how to play that scale, so I just did it in my head.) The options are F  C G  D  A (remember Fast Cars Go Dangerously Around Every Bend).  For this same answer the constructor could have made it easier by cluing E Major(4 sharps) or harder (F# with 6 or C# with 7).  FWIW, DSHARP has only been clued to a major key twice before, both times in 2017, once to the key of B Major and once to

As far as where lemurs exist, I guess the clue should have read where they are indigenous to.  With zoos and botanical gardens, fauna and flora can now be found almost anywhere in the world.

It took me forever to work out it was a rebus, which I‚Äôm blaming on a very, very long dog walk at the coast in the heat, followed by a fairly liquid lunch.

"I quite enjoyed this puzzle, even though it took me several minutes above my average to complete, as rebus puzzles often do. I don't default to thinking about rebuses when solving Thursdays and Sundays, which probably has something to do with that. I'm more likely to assume that what I think the answer is is wrong, and there is another word out there that I'm missing.

For instance, the only Total Request Live host I am aware of was CARSONDALY, but when it didn't fit, I shrugged and moved on. Similarly, when I did my first down pass, I tried various combinations of statuette, statue, etc. but nothing fit and I moved on.

Only when I got to 85A and the only possible answer was SOULFOOD and I couldn't think of any five letter Montana cities of any significance did the rebus bell ring. Even knowing what was afoot, it took awhile to track down all of the slots.

Good to see some moms mentioned on this hallowed day: Marie Curie and Mary Lincoln. Jen from the White House might also be a mother, Greta Gerwig has two young kids with Noah Baumbach. Dr. Ruth has two children, both academics in the field of education. Ayn Rand never had children but apparently was kind to children. She once said in an interview that she felt her books were kind of like having children. ""The ideas just want to come out."" Gertrude Stein had no children but liked writing stories for children, including ""The World Is Round."" Jennifer Egan has two sons who are being raised Jewish even though she's agnostic. It is unclear if Ella Baker had any children but her activism was spurred in large part by listening to her grandmother's stories of slavery and the mistreatment of women. Mary Todd Lincoln had four boys; the best known is Tad, his father's favorite. Of the four, only Robert the oldest survived his parents; all the others died young. Tad and William were ""hellions"" as youngsters in Abe's law offices:

 ""The boys were absolutely unrestrained in their amusement.

In my scheme of things, cracking a puzzle comes first, and the rest ‚Äì theme, answer set, clues ‚Äì follow; they are gravy.  Today‚Äôs puzzle not only gave me a satisfying nut to crack, it gave me the rest as well.  It smartly did its job, gave me a terrific experience.

"The Van Halen rider thing is true - they did request ridiculous things like ‚Äúabsolutely no brown M+Ms‚Äù - but it wasn‚Äôt entirely about being entitled rock star divas.

They would haul a vast amount of production to each show. Trucks and trucks full of elaborate staging, lighting and sound equipment. It all weighed a huge amount, and on one notable occasion sank through the newly-installed floor of an auditorium causing thousands of dollars‚Äô worth of damage. 

It turned out that the promoter for that show had not read the detailed technical specifications in the contract. 

On subsequent tours they would include ridiculous rider demands somewhere else in the contract. They didn‚Äôt really care about M+Ms but the idea was to test if the promoter had read the document properly. If they arrived and there were brown M+Ms in the dressing room, it was a litmus test that someone hadn‚Äôt read the contract closely so they‚Äôd better check and re-check that the venue understood the  technical specs before loading in and rigging up. 

Conversely, if they got a phone call in advance asking if they REALLY needed a football helmet full of cream cheese, or whatever other stupid stuff they‚Äôd stipulated, it showed that the promoter was paying attention, then they could have an informed conversation about how many amps of electricity the PA would need, and so on.
