"AAARRRGGG!!!  I just blew my 373 day streak!  I finished the puzzle in 39 minutes.  Not bad for a Saturday.  Had to look up a couple of the names (TOADETTE, BORG and NANCY).  Then I spent 16 minutes looking for the mistake.  I checked all the Os to make sure they weren't zeroes.  My husband went through the answer key with me one letter at a time.  It all looked perfectly fine.

Finally I gave up and turned on Auto-check.  It marked the C in CENA as wrong???  So I typed in the C again and got the happy music.

Then it all came back to me....  I have both English and Russian keyboards on my iPad.  I switch between them using the CapsLock key.  I had EPA, so typed C_NA.  Then I noticed that I was getting Russian characters instead.  Oops.  I backed up and erased the –¢ and –§, changing them to N and A.  But I forgot about the C.  The Russian C looks just like the English C and is the same key on the keyboard.  But the underlying ASCII code is different, and that's what the xword software is looking at.

I lived in St. Petersburg Russia for 2 years in 2017-19, so really needed both keyboards.  I don't need it much anymore, but keep it going for nostalgia's sake.  

It's OK.  Streaks come and go.  But the daily crossword keeps my old brain working and that's what is important.",1,positive,0.7246627807617188
"This puzzle was quite frustrating, to the point I have to post my first comment to one. 
There‚Äôs some types of clues that I tolerate but never enjoy (sports clues, outdated slang) but very few types of clues I actually find totally irritating: the absurdly specific stretch. This puzzle included too much of all that. 
BORG, TENNIS, ANDONE, RACEBIBS, IM SET (come on, it‚Äôs ""I‚Äôm all set""), NANCY, NENE, RPI‚Ä¶ and the worst of all: DEMS. Although it isn‚Äôt surprising that an NYT publication would call a clearly centrist party left. That‚Äôs just straight up wrong.",4,negative,0.8685252070426941
"This was another great puzzle.  Very clever cluing made this a question of when to put in your best guess.  I find that I wait on confirmation from crosses before filling in that first/second/third guess. For example 54A I guessed early as ""tugsat"".  But I waited until 47D fell into place before filling in ""tugs"" then saw that tugson would fit rather than my first guess. Similarly with ligers/tigons.
 I think I'm describing routine puzzle solving for all of you experienced solvers, but new ones might appreciate talk about the thinking process.

Just wondering if there is a place for a gentler onramp. 

In the other direction, now that my average Sunday solve has gone from two weeks to about 20 minutes (and my average Saturday solve has gone from 'never' to about the same as Sunday), wondering whether there is a place other than the archive for stiffer puzzles.

Little by little, I managed to start chipping away, finally remembering words that had been hiding out in the back of my brain, sometimes in frustration grabbing the grid by the throat and threatening to strangle it if it didn't cough up at least something else that would help me even a little, and by some miracle it did start to fill up. 

In the end, I had two look-ups‚ÄîJohn's last name and yes, Mr. Horrible, Nero‚Äîand chagrin was what I felt when I saw that all the beautiful, clever clues resolved into a fresh (maybe even easy for some) richly rewarding construction.

Did I like your puzzle, Rebecca and Rafael? 

OH GOD YES!!!!",32,positive,0.7614278793334961
"Really fun long entries. 

I flew through this one. It never fails that when I can get the NW first, the rest usually falls quickly. 

Sub 20, which is really quick Saturday, for me.   I am especially pleased with myself because I think I generally struggle with the constructors past creations. 

It‚Äôs nice to see TOADETTE get some love. I‚Äôve heard of Ligers, but not TIGONS. 

Thanks for the fun constructors.",11,positive,0.9728241562843323
"I was doing ok on this one but a number of little miscues on the upper tiers, like:

Ihavetoask instead of IHATETOASK,
aver before AVOW
Spot instead of SLOT
ligers before TIGONS

threw me off briefly.  EVENTUALLY, however I finished in a reasonable time.  Lots of clever misdirections in this one.

Anais Mitchell‚Äôs Bright Star is a lovely song, and her work with Bonny Light Horsemen is good too.  I‚Äôve not seen or heard Hadestown, but the puzzle has inspired me to give it a listen.  I read somewhere that her father named her after Anais Nin, which seems a bit cheeky to me.",9,neutral,0.4470870792865753

"Kia/loaed myself with the feline hybrid, confidently entered liGer. Then overthought the fruit. Felt it couldn‚Äôt be the other plum /apricot (PLUOT) and so started looking for some other. 
Incidentally, I am sure that I have seen PLUOT previously in NYT xwords, but cannot recall aprium. 
I noticed that the former is accepted by my spell-check the latter not.",4,neutral,0.8044131994247437
"Caitlin, your interpretation of the NAPA clue is absolutely correct! I can't count how many times I've submitted [The cabs are here!] as a clue for NAPA. I'm so glad it finally survived into a NYT puzzle, and even more glad that you caught the reference!",73,positive,0.9670240879058838
"This was a toughie.  I EVENTUALLY gave up in the SE because there were two words there I did not know: and I had COMPOST TIP instead of BIN and the noodle and lava could have been SOTA and NEPE for all I knew.  Otherwise the puzzle was  fair.  Other unknowns (RIRI?  ANAIS?? even TOADETTE) were gettable from the crosses.  And I was glad that my first guess for the Univ. on the Hudson, RPI, survived.

I got the cabs = NAPA and the SYRAH grape quickly which may say something about how I occupy my time now that I am retired.  But the basketball clue completely eluded me which is probably  against some local law here in Louisville.  I still don't know why a flute might CLINK unless you tap someone on the head with it.",10,negative,0.5348875522613525
"I thought this one had me! Fortunately I stuck with it, trusted my gut and had some luck! I never would‚Äôve guessed TOADETTE, so that was a look-up, which helped with northeast corner. The answer to the specific hybrid fruit and dark grape varieties existed only in a dusty old corner of my mind, and required all but one letter!

Do you love a good analogy? I tried to solve 48D through logic but instead learned about a RHINO collective being called a crash through crossings. Makes sense when you think about it.

My girl Rihanna made the puzzle with her nickname. I love RIRI but she‚Äôs woefully behind schedule with a new album. I mean, it‚Äôs been since 2016! I get that she‚Äôs in her mogul era with cosmetics, lingerie, fashion and‚Äî yes ‚Äî a perfume, but dang!

The GOLDENHOUR here in Portugal is truly something to behold. Some photos I have taken seem surreal. I love it here.",18,positive,0.8462993502616882

"Que SYRAH, SYRAH. 
Any puzzle with TOSCA in it is okay by me.  Can't deny that this wasn't a struggle, but I ultimately got there, perhaps because I didn't find the puzzle clued as vaguely as many a Saturday puzzle.  TOADETTE came from somewhere. I have no idea where.
Did not know Ms Mitchell, but will hopefully remember her.  Never saw Hadestown, but always enjoyed the promos.",24,positive,0.6198642253875732
"I agree with Dave Rosenbaum‚Äôs comment about PLOUT and TOADETTE.. 

I had a fairly easy solve going, then I tried to finish the north and northeast. For 11D I had I HAvE TO ASK. It‚Äôs a recognizable phrase, so I though I was OK. I didn‚Äôt know 10A, but I figured 10D was RACE BIB, and 13D was I‚ÄôM SET. EVENTUALLY, I figured out that RIRI was related to Rihanna (in my mind her name was spelled ‚ÄúRhianna‚Äù), a singer whose name I recognize, but whose music I do not.

That got me to the sticky things: 8D and 20A. To me they were crossing Naticks. After seeing a comment here, many people might know TOADETTE, so it wouldn't be a Natick for them. I‚Äôve never played Mario games, so I was stuck.

I didn‚Äôt like what I had for the end of 20A: T_ADEVTE.  What the heck do I do with ‚ÄúEVDT‚Äù? Aha! Not I HAVE TO, but I HATE TO ASK. That helped a lot.

I still had no clue what the hybrid fruit was, but a little persistence‚Äîand a couple passes through the grid to see if I might have had another HAvE/HATE type of mistake‚Äîgave me PLOUT, TOADETTE, and the happy music.

Whew!

"Fun puzzle, Mr. Musa and Ms Goldstein!

The clue for NAPA amused me: I didn‚Äôt know the basketball player‚Äôs cry, so I was trying to make something work with TA-TA in that slot. Then I finally figured it out. 

OPEN SEASON gave me an earworm of a favorite song written by the brilliant Rodney Crowell. A title like ‚ÄúOPEN SEASON On My Heart‚Äù really shouldn‚Äôt work, but Mr. Crowell pulls it off admirably.
