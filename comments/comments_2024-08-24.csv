Didn't know the country singer or the CODA director. Also didn't know the snowboarding event or the pop artist. 

Felt like I was double naticked this morning.

Hoped against hope that something in the clues might lead me in the right direction. Was the singer's name Bayes? Hayes? Mayes? Something else? And Sian, where is that from? Ireland? Don't know.

And then that other crossing---could it be BI-GAIN and NON English??? Or maybe BIG-AIR and RON ENGLISH? Or ... who knows what.

In the end, I went with the alliterative HUNTERHAYES and the somewhat less ridiculous BIGAIR and RON English.

So I solved the puzzle unaided, but not pleasantly. And don't even mention YEATS meeting YUCA. Or was it KEATS and KUCA?

Like many other people, I got a little stuck at HUNTER HAYES crossing Sian HEDER. I listen to a fair amount of country music, but I don‚Äôt recognize Mr. Hayes or his 2012 hit. And while we all enjoyed CODA, I didn‚Äôt remember the director‚Äôs name. 

Less problematic was the YEATS/YUCA crossing. The poet could have been Keats, but ‚Äúno country for old men‚Äù sounded more like what little I know of Yeats‚Äôs poetry than Keats‚Äôs. And I was pretty sure that YUCA was correct, though I haven‚Äôt eaten yuca fries. 

In the end, though, I was slowed by a typo in the gimme TIME, INC. Luckily, it didn‚Äôt take me too long to find that.",14,neutral,0.4583880305290222
"Playing from the UK i found this very Natick-y, but I was on the right wavelength for the wordplay ones so it wasn't a total exercise in frustration. 'Shticky' bothered me though.",21,negative,0.6575851440429688
"Very easy Saturday, 16 minutes. Didn't love the HUNTERHAYES/HEDER crossing though",61,positive,0.4142356216907501
"I haven't even started today's / Saturday's puzzle yet but thanks to the call outs about Deb's collaboration puzzle from April 2nd, 2019, I just finished that one up and thought it was a real hoot!! So glad I went back and did it!

Highly recommend if you're working through the archives. I'm still in April of 2023 but I like to go back and do other others that I see recommended. 

I loved Deb's partner in the puzzle, Natasha Lyonne, in Poker Face! I hope they'll be another season!  And another collaboration between the two!!",10,positive,0.9724077582359314
Fun and smooth solve but this has been a surprising easy Thu- Fri-Sat this week. On days like these I miss puzzles from the archives (2019 and earlier) which are significantly tougher and pose much more of a challenge . Keen to know if there's been a deliberate attempt by the editors to make puzzles easier and more accessible post COVID given the number of new solvers who took this up during the pandemic.,7,positive,0.7964931130409241
"Liked this puzzle except for the cross of 24D and 39A, which was sort of a ""you know it or you don't"" situation.",20,positive,0.8894463777542114
"The reward of suffering for me were the many experiences of my all weather tires rolling around in the snow ... and not getting any traction. And then there was that one February going up the Donner Pass...

I like the weird vibe this puzzle gives off, like he might OVERDO the CATTY a bit with A*S, OAF and WACKO, but then there's pinky swears, couples walking arm in arm across the bridge over the river Kwai and gay men on Grindr seeking to canoodle, so it all works out. Oh, and the beauty of yuca fries, turkey jerkey and pinky swears in the middle there, great sounds when said together, with barley water to wash it down -- not to everyone's taste, but works for me! Plus FOSTER KITTEN shows Mr. McCarty's SOFT SIDE -- he's more kitty than catty!

Shticky is a little icky, and Hunter Hayes x director Heder is def a little Naticky but it didn't make me panicky so I shan't complain. 

Glad to see something other than Ol√© for Spanish cheers but now Viva Las Vegas is stuck in my head, and it's driving me a little WACKO.

There's a thousand pretty women waitin' out there
And they're all livin' the devil may care
And I'm just the devil with love to spare, so
Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas!",35,negative,0.5754117369651794
"I had a little struggle with this one especially the SE corner.  I got stuck thinking of hand in hand, which didn‚Äôt fit, but which blocked me from coming up with ARMINARM for a time.  Coming up with CAGEY eventually gave me enough to put the rest of that section together.  This is the second day in a row where most of the general knowledge/name questions (other than YEATS and KWAI) were not familiar and I needed to work from crosses, so I was pleased to finish.",8,neutral,0.5343568921089172
"Claudius started life as a FOSTER KITTEN. 

He didn‚Äôt know he would end up with a person TYPECAST as a childless cat lady.

He might secretly think it‚Äôs all a bit SHTICKY, but he tries not to be CATTY about it.",49,neutral,0.5860665440559387

Nothing, though, that I wasn't sure of by the time I hit the last key.
