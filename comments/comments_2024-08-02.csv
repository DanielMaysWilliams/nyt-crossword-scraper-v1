"First of all, I actually got ISPEPSIOK — because I finally realized that so many of the other clues and solutions were equally, tediously threadbare.  I am not saying my perspective is “right,” but there comes a point in solving a puzzle in which the creator seems far more inclined toward self-congratulatory obscurity than creating a puzzle that is a delight to be shared by creator and solver.  I hated this puzzle.  It truly felt as if the creator wanted to be able to justify every obscurity, rather than to make its creation a solution a shared sequence of aha! pleasures.  And since a drink server could be a bartender, a flight attendant, a sommelier, a barista, or John Belushi, NONE of whom would have said anything like that, I just hope the Times puzzle staff can distinguish between those puzzles that offer shared pleasure — like a well-crafted mystery — and those in which a creator pursues RATTY obscurity with a righteous sense of “I can justify it so stop griping.”  Indeed.  If I see this creator’s authorship on any future puzzle, I will skip it.  A well crafted puzzle should inspire a grin of pleasure, not such a cumulative sense of irritation that I invest 1,308 characters in underscoring the stark difference between a great puzzle and one that feels like an obscurist’s ego trip.",2,negative,0.764456570148468

After my first pass I had only one or two filled and a few more penciled in. I was ready to be a hater, as lately this pattern has led to some real slogs. But as I found more crosses, tried more answers, and realized ISPEPSIOK was not just a silly answer to amuse myself but the true fill, my attitude did a full 180!

"Regarding ""Flattest state in the U.S.: Abbr."", it seems that the correct answer depends on what ""flattest"" means. FLA is the state with the lowest high point (Britton Hill, at 345 ft above sea level). But the mean elevation across the entire state of FLA is about 100 ft. On the other hand, the mean elevation across DEL is only 60 ft, so ""on the average"" DEL could be considered flatter than FLA. Apparently the high point in DEL is ""Ebright Road"" on the border with PA, coming in at 448 ft above sea level. (KAN has a mean elevation of 2000 ft above sea level, which is more than 1300 ft above its low point.)

It's funny that in blind taste tests, Pepsi consistently out performs Coke. It is the whole reason New Coke was created. When the furious backlash hit, Coke realized they would win the cola wars with nostalgia and marketing, not taste.

I will add to the chorus praising IS PEPSI OK. Add me as well to the crew gob-smacked that anyone might possibly think that phrase is not ""in the language""! Truly an alternate world to mine. (Hello, @sotto voce @HeathieJ!)

Absolutely loved the STL clue, once it finally clicked. Ditto USS, though that resolved faster for me. (I should've known when UpS went in waaaay too quickly!) Literally all I know about US football is that there are 4 downs possible in each drive. FIRST AND one, since it's the start? Lol.

Years ago someone did a chemical breakdown between coke and Pepsi and the ONLY diff was coke has an orange extract and Pepsi has a lemon one.

But according to my doctor the synthetic stuff they have in there is so much worse than all those things “regular” has.

Deb, I needed this First Pass Friday today. It's reassuring to see that even experienced solvers like you found this puzzle challenging. My initial pass mirrored yours exactly, which was both validating and humbling given how little we both managed to fill in at first. I appreciate your candid approach, especially your willingness to use the autocorrect function and try different letters when at a loss. It's a great reminder that solving isn't about proving how smart you are, but about enjoying the process and learning.

As I slowly pieced together the answers, the puzzle gained momentum. Those 'aha' moments when several clues suddenly clicked were incredibly rewarding, leading to a deeply satisfying finish – even though it was one of my longest Friday solve times!

I've been crosswording for 50 years. Can someone explain PEG as part of a violin quartet?,2,neutral,0.7651681900024414
"This puzzle did not sit well with me at all! Sorry!

Going through the comments:

I agree with Teresa, too many random phrases, and Chris had a good reply to that: ""sneerat and yellat do not belong in the same puzzle. Once is pushing it, twice is lazy.""

TMD didn't like the cluing and thought the puzzle a slog with few fun answers. My opinion as well. Rajeevfromca found too many vague clues, and I agree STETS is not ""leave"" strictly speaking. I might add that I never see it as a verb, nor do I ever see the plural EROSIONS.

Many people didn't like 13D [card letters] for STL and I didn't either, it's not a vague clue, it's just obscure for no reason. While I'm at it, 15D [color for un campeon] is the best clue you can come up with for the Spanish word for gold? Besides, do gold silver and bronze really refer to the colors of the medals or the metals they are composed of? 

30D SUPER. Really?

50A PEG [Part of a violin quartet?] Please.

Hopefully better puzzles will come. Development through experimentation!

What else. Yeah, Pepsi's ok.",12,negative,0.7350857257843018
"I entered this puzzle in neutral-head, and left it high-fiving the world.  This was SO ENTERTAINING!  Clues that made my brain hustle as it loves to do, clues that made me “Hah!”, gorgeous answers, 13 bigs (answers of eight letters or more) that brought dash, and an emphasis on cracking riddles rather than scouring the memory for answers.

Wow! 

When a puzzle satisfies my brain’s work ethic, brings giddiness from figuring out thorny wordplay clues, brings humor, and immerses me in beauty, it has royally delivered.

Beauty?  AUGMENT, GAP YEAR, POINT TAKEN, WENT ROGUE, FIRST AND TEN, STILL I RISE.

Riddles? One of many:[Take off, as a cap] for UNSCREW, a lovely misdirect.  Look at how this clue make a humdrum answer special. 

Humor? [Testament to human nature] for I'M NOT A ROBOT.  Hah!

Not to mention the craft behind this: a 30-block grid (translation: seas of white housing a mass of crossing answers), with hardly a whiff of junk.

Hi Deb - Second hardest of the week ?? Woof this one was tough ! Felt very accomplished when I finally got there ! Decided to leave -STET - but stayed with it and finished in my longest time for a Friday in a while . Amazing cluing .  I laughed when I finally got IS PEPSI OK ? - almost my last entry . I continue to be amazed at constructors that can think this way ! Way to go Kate .,9,positive,0.9578053951263428

IS PEPSI OK reminded me of someone I worked with 45 years ago.  He insisted he could tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi and would only drink Coke.

I was absolutely convinced that I was going to have to look at least a couple of things up to get enough seed letters to get me going, but knowing FLA is the flattest state and that SALINAS was Steinbeck’s hometown gave me just enough purchase to begin to crack this one.  The dam broke when I quit trying to find some way to fit ice or rocks into the drink order clue, and came up with ISPEPSIOK.

Spoken colloquialisms like SO THERE are always a crapshoot for me. There was much less trivia / proper nouns than usual, but many of them (NIGEL, ROSEN, FLA) were not readily known to me.

"Yet another puzzle that ran circles around me...

The SW was messed up when for ""what's the...?"" I got stuck on ""big deal"" for a while.

Then there was ""This and that"" which first spurred a thought of ""tchotchkes,"" followed by what I find to be one of the most beautiful songs from Fiddler on the Roof, a favorite musical of mine. 
The song is ""Anatevka"":
A little bit of this
A little bit of that
A pot, a pan, a broom, a hat...

So, I stopped solving and revisited the video on Youtube.
When I got to STILL I RISE, I did it again.
(For those who missed out on the video when it was previously posted, here it is, with Maya Angelou oozing charisma:
https://youtu.be/qviM_GnJbOM?feature=shared)

Yes, I was very distracted solving this puzzle, and I made a lot of mistakes, but that ultimately got corrected and set off what our fellow commenter Warren from Malta, NY calls ""the domino effect."" Oof!

Laughed at IS PEPSI OK?
But seriously, no, it isn't. Not ever. (Hi, HeathieJ!)
When I say ""Diet Coke, please,"" I absolutely mean ""Diet Coke, please.""
To be honest, I skip this whole conversation and go straight to ""Do you have Coke or Pepsi?"" 
I like to think that waiters are grateful that I don't waste their time and get straight to the point.

And the point I haven't yet made here is that I loved this puzzle, despite of, or maybe even because of my foibles and distractions.
I don't mind that it ran circles around me and sent me off on tangents. It was loads of fun.

Thank you Ms. Chin Park!",21,neutral,0.4163890480995178
