Very enjoyable puzzle! 

Loved all the theme answers, especially that silly ole Pooh bear!

Also loved GASP for ""Shock proof"" -- super cute!

Had one error that needed finding, the crossing of 48A and 38D. I was pretty sure that Brian the singer's name started with an E from other puzzles, and the N came easily but I put down CLaNK for the across answer. It seemed quite reasonable to me. It's the only one that I thought could possibly be a mistake because everything else looked good. 

Completely on me that I didn't fully remember Brian's name. I always hope these tough for me crossings (and posting about it) help me remember it in the future!

It's usually shouted, in fact.

I had DOUBLE CLuCK for ""tsk, tsk"" before I had DOUBLE CLICK -- and mine is funnier, even though it's not a phrase.

I sense the twinkle in John‚Äôs eyes in his puzzles, and heck, you can see it in his headshot on XwordInfo.

John sets a high bar, spending 100 hours just coming up with the theme answer set for this puzzle.  That‚Äôs before coming up with a grid design, a decent total answer set, and the cluing.  Do you know how long it takes to clue a Sunday puzzle, actually coming up with novel clues rather than just repeating clues from the past?  Many, many more hours.

The non-theme cluing, IMO, was one of the best parts of this puzzle ‚Äì with so much spark, such as in this trio of never-before-used clues: [Shock proof?] for GASP, [Park worker?] for VALET, and [Tiger‚Äôs target] for PAR.

The theme answers that took so long for him to come up with ‚Äì and I believe if you try to come up with some good ones yourself, you‚Äôll see why ‚Äì were simply lovely overall, including the world-class worth-the-price-of-admission THIS BEAR‚ÄôS REPEATING for [Pooh-pooh?].

[Say it again, louder]

So much to love in this puzzle!
From my pennant-flagged former home state, to, OHH, my current home! Ste. Anne de D√©troit! The second oldest parish in the United States, co-founded in 1701 by French Franciscan and Jesuit priests (orders which did not always play well with one another). The original building was closer to downtown Detroit, and of course burnt down, as did several subsequent re-buildings--the current basilica, from 1886,  is the eighth incarnation. (https://tinyurl.com/2prcc6hx) The neighborhood was at first predominantly French, then Irish, then Latino, and now Urban Hipsters--at one point, during the 1940's, Masses (including sermons) were said in Latin, French, English, and Spanish. You can buy a great homemade guac at the nearby La Colmena grocery store (very busy around 1pm on Sunday, after the noon Spanish Mass ends).

Mozart wrote two symphonies in G minor, Nos. 25 and 40; and whereas the 4Oth is all elegance and grace, the earlier one--which you might recognize as the opening title music to *Amadeus*--is definitely *Sturm und Drang*: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnxS9iPBTkw

A very clever puzzle much appreciated; a rarity I ever await. The genius reminds me of a NYT favorite puzzle of mine from long ago I can‚Äôt recall the title or cruciverbalist who made it but I chuckle now at psychedelicatessen long before it was plagiarized! LOL,12,positive,0.9715968370437622

"This puzzle was obviously oversized, but it seemed wider than just one extra column. 

I thought, as did others, that the Pooh entry was worth the price of admission.",24,neutral,0.6522698402404785

"Hear! Hear! This sublimely clever theme really made me smile. Nine theme entries and each one special in its own way.  

‚ÄúPooh, Pooh?‚Äù for THIS BEARS REPEATING is fabulous, and ""11?"" for ONE AFTER ANOTHER is just brilliant.

This is the constructor‚Äôs fourth Sunday puzzle of 2024.  Wow!

Congratulations, John, very impressive.",78,positive,0.9846921563148499

"We had a great time repeating these theme answers out loud as we went, sharing a laugh each time.
The effort put into such an extensive theme list and the care taken in choosing the fill shows.  We surely appreciate smooth puzzles like this!
Thank you for another entertaining brunch puzzle.",31,positive,0.9848811626434326
"Pretty easy but a fun theme.

I smiled a fair amount.

The upper half slowed me slightly but much of the rest filled in on autopilot.

Kind of saddening to hear how long the constructor worked on it then.  :(
