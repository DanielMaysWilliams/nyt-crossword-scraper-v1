"I twisted that OREO in the center, and out came the crème de la crème of a Tuesday puzzle, spread out over the whole grid, with unusual and beautiful entries.

Not only was it delicious, it was also melodic and harmonious.

I admit to falling in the USSR trap, but it was quickly corrected to CCCP since I solve by crisscrossing as I go.
This led to that crossing of TAJIK with TAIGA being already in place but for the T, when Tajikistan rang a bell. 
So, quite by luck, I was able to solve without any hurdles.

Thank you for a terrific puzzle, Mr. Buchbinder, as well as for having me dig up Oasis again and listen to ""Wonderwall"" and ""Champagne Supernova.""

But one of my favorites is still ""Don't Look Back in Anger,"" maybe because that simple imperative sits well with me as one of the golden rules of life.

"It's a good thing I don't remember enough about music to have thought of CdEF, especially since I had enough other problems in other areas. I think they've already been stated adequately in earlier comments, so I won't rehash. I definitely found it a harder than normal Tuesday for me and definitely outside my normal time, but I got there cleanly eventually.  

Besides, if I were wearing a MOOD ring, it would currently be whatever the color is for kinda fuzzy-headed and crabby for no apparent reason—which can definitely sour things. This isn't my normal MO, thankfully, but I always try to avoid making judgements when my ring does turn this color. 

But I still wanted to say that I did very much enjoy plugging in THE SOUND OF MUSIC pretty early on!  That was worth the price of admission for me!

Why?  Because I belonged to the Nazarene Church, which believed that going to movies was validating Hollywood's ""immoral life style"".

My Junior High Honors Club took a trip to Denver, a day trip from the Pueblo, one of the events being The Sound of Music.  I asked my pastor if there weren't *some* movies that were ok.  He said they were all made by evil people.  With that Harvey Weinstein stuff that came out, I guess I can't say he's wrong.

For starters, TIL that it's ""Blue Rondo à la Turk"" (and not ""alla Turk"").

""[??Roger's remarks] just spurred an idea for an April Fools Day puzzle that'd probably elicit 1000+ comments. (I hope no one actually takes up this idea) :

A puzzle made (almost) entirely of those controversial bugaboos of the Wordplay Comments: nothing incorrect, nothing ""wrong"", just, the puzzle's entries would (almost) ALL be words like OCTOPI, and the Tic-Tac-Toe clue/answer just mentioned (OXO), no Naticks or anything controversial outside of crossword-world, just clue/answers that create such a hubbub every time they appear. So let's see, TAMALES, I'm blanking on others but there are so many of them. Strictly linguistic objections and controversy.

Of course the constructor could also throw in, for the necessary short easy fill, things like OREO clued as ""A black and white cookie"", ONO as ""Yoko ___"" or ""John Lennon's life/ 'Double Fantasy' partner"", with no wit or inventiveness whatsoever. Hah.

If it were a Sunday puzzle perhaps the title would be ""Mar-teehee de Sade"". Or ""Marquis de HEY!!!!!""

"Seemed a bit trickier than a usual Tuesday puzzle to me. I went significantly over my average time.

Plenty of misdirection and unknowns. I knew TAIGA and CCCP, but TAJIK and JELLYBEAN took me forever. I also had bawled instead of WAILED, which messed up that section even more. I know THE WHO, but not the song, so I didn't get that answer right away.

"I had a couple of issues with Sam’s column today. She started off discussing how she ended up using “check puzzle” to help find an error after already completing the puzzle. Since I personally pay no attention to streaks, I have often used this technique when I’ve completed a puzzle, have just about spent all the time I want to on it, or maybe just want to avoid wasting my time “running the alphabet” just to get a gold star. I don’t know why she brought up Deb’s use of “Autocheck” right from the start…..that’s a whole different animal, as many of us have already commented on in the recent past.  Also, she mentioned that with 42A a “cardinal rule of crossword construction is to not include any entry word in clues”. We’ve been through this numerous times here and any “cardinal” rule (if there is such a thing) is that an entry cannot appear in its own clue.  Ok. That’s all….",8,neutral,0.5045515298843384

"A clever theme with a great revealer -- and MUCH harder than most Tuesdays, which in my book is a good thing.  I solved it as a themeless -- especially since there were plenty of other things to think about other than trying to find a common thread.  I wonder if I would have picked up on the homophones if I'd gone looking for a theme.

So they call them CUBE FARMS now.  They were merely cubicles in my day and we hated them.  Of course people didn't work much of the week from home the way people do today; if you were in a cubicle, you were really IN it.  I always felt that office productivity could easily be tripled just by putting everyone in an office with a door that could be closed.  Rant over.

For ""tissue sample test"" I wanted something like PERSON WITH A BAD COLD BLOWING HIS NOSE AND SNEEZING.  I never thought of that kind of tissue.  Can you imagine?

Such a good puzzle. Sam -- but why do you have five (5!!!) pop music clues?  Why would you cross two of them, OASIS and ALA when both entries can be clued in a zillion ways without using a musical reference?  Yes, it's a musical-themed puzzle, I get it, but there are only so many pop music trivia clues I want to see in a puzzle.

When USSR doesn't work, I doubt there's anyone under the age of 65 who will get CCCP without all the crosses.  Bur once I saw that USSR wouldn't work, CCCP came back to me in a rush.
