"I like a tough puzzle. I solve most Saturdays without lookups. (Unpopular opinion: Thursdays are my favourite because I’m always hopeful for a rebus.)

I think what I’m reading (and feeling) about this puzzle is that its difficulty wasn’t satisfying.

I don’t mind a stumper but this puzzle doesn’t seem to offer cleverness or ‘aha!’ reveals or growth opportunity. Honestly, the difficulty was a little boring. I don’t know why it feels that way but I’m sure in over 600 comments there will be lots of thoughts lol!",0,positive,0.8927448391914368

"This puzzle was sneaky and witty and chewy and well-constructed and sneaky and truly a Saturday puzzle and well-woven and sneaky and fun and hard and I-almost-gave-up-on-this-one and clever and solid and informative and wry and sneaky and good.

Did I mention sneaky?

And I mean that in the most complimentary Saturday-worthy-Saturday-puzzle kinda way, I don't mean unfair at all. I don't think anything was unfair. I mean I bet there were some culturally-idiomatic answers that might've flummoxed some foreign solvers (""Git along little DOGIES"" I felt very sure about, had heard the song as a kid— and I grew up in Detroit with no special exposure to Westerns or cowboy stuff— but if I were from Denmark or somewhere, fuhgeddaboutit).

Loved the could-go-either-way meaning of so many of the clues, didn't even get ""headscarfed"" pun till the column (I'd figured maybe ""The Walking Dead"" or other zombie works involved head-scarves), every answer when it finally fell (not necessarily THUDded) into place felt like ""AHa, I SEE, that's right"", but the sneakiness! bORABORA TORAtORA TORABORA! Glora be!

If I hadn't encountered ANORAK strictly from Xwords I'd never have eventually gotten it, and that wasn't right away and not even the right spelling, but I think without that I might've had to throw in the towel.

"This was brutal, but in an excellent way. It took me almost an hour (over the space of the last 18 hours) and that’s the longest it has taken me to solve a Fri/Sat puzzle in quite some time. 

I got CZARISTS without too much trouble, although I had to correct TS to CZ. And TORA BORA took setting the puzzle aside twice before that popped into my head. 

I had more problems with GENE/MEME, the Cinderella clue, and MEDIOCRE. The SE was tough, but the NW was tougher. 

Once I got my brain back, I noticed and enjoyed some of the intersecting entries. BUBBLY/LEES, ANORAK/RAINCOAT, and a couple of others. 

I also firmly believe that IT STINKS is a shoutout to MST3K fans everywhere, because it was featured in the movie “Pod People.” It also made me think of “The Critic,” an animated comedy voiced by Jon Lovitz. That was the line the character used to pan a movie.

"I have to stop reading comments because I have to go make dinner. I got from the beginning until about 4-5 hours ago. It's a lot to wade through, and I made a lot of comments along the way.

I liked the puzzle, ultimately. It was *really* tough for me (more than 2x my Saturday average time), and on the ""if/when"" scale of solving it was the first time I've encountered an ""if"" in a while. In the end I did make it thru without any lookups, and yeah that felt really good so yay endorphins.

Disheartened, once again, by the vitriol in some of the comments. Not everyone will like every puzzle, and certainly there were *many* who didn't like today's. I agree with some of the criticism; for example I do think that ""BAD THING"", while legitimately in the language, could have been better clued related to ""Is that a BAD THING?"" which is how I've mostly heard it. Almost all of the other clues and answers pass muster for me on a Saturday. And for goodness's (is that how it's punctuated?) sake, if you want to criticize the puzzle--which I encourage--please have something more to say than ""worst puzzle ever"" or ""fire Joel"". 

Perhaps after dinner, or perhaps tomorrow, I'll come back and try to read the rest of the comments.

Every answer was wrong, except YES in the nw and ADO in the sw. It's only a puzzle, but I wanted to cry as I erased all my other seemingly reasonable answers. 

I kept filling in wrong answers for a while, checking puzzle after every 5 or so. Finally, I allowed myself to look at the first two of Caitlin's tricky clues. I filled those in and was able to start building. I allowed myself one more look up of a short answer, Dodger's foe, for IRS. I didn't want to reveal anything big, and figured it was a sports clue that I wouldn't know anyhow. From there, very painstakingly, I got the entire North filled in without any more lookups, though I did keep doing check puzzle after every 5 entries, but now they were correct.

IMHO, this was a terrible puzzle. I like to be challenged. This was just aggravating. 

As Byron writes, he gave us the terms to describe it:

MEDIOCRE. IT STINKS. It landed with a THUD. 

Start with the NW corner. 

If BAD THING is not green paint, I don’t know what is. One of the worst entries in memory. BIG UPSET is almost as bad. 

The clue for 17A would have been brilliant for HORSES. But DOGIES is completely and needlessly obscure. I gather from Google (after the fact) that it must refer to a 1934 song. 1934!! Are you kidding me?

UPTRENDS? Not. A. Thing.

Do I care who created Python? No.

Finally: a PINT is not a “Cup alternative.” It is two cups. I understand that clues are not definitions, but this one is simply and plainly wrong, because it refers to measurements — which by definition are not “alternatives” for each other. Even if you stretched and said that PINT was standing in for a glass of beer, it doesn’t make sense. You don’t have a “cup” of beer, or of wine or any other alternative to beer.

In over 30 years of solving, I have grown accustomed to the cleverness that constructors have at their disposal, most notably in their selections of themes, but also in their word choices. It doesn't enhance the solving experience to feel that cleverness. What really thrills me is when a constructor completely BEWILDERS me. Byron Walden and Manny Nosowsky are, for me, the best examples of this. ""Step up to the plate, son, now we will see your mettle.""

"I could not finish the southwest corner because there is a mistake in the puzzle. The word “hoser” is not a British term, and if you look to its origin you’ll find that it is Canadian. The word does have murky origins, but is most definitely Canadian and I demand retraction.

"Hmmmm, I dunno. Mr. Walden's notes lead me to believe he anticipated pushback against this puzzle...and clearly he was correct.

Huge challenge for me. It took me over 50 minutes, even with looking up the cave, the random programmer, and yes, the lowly OREO. (After completing the puzzle--to calculate the appropriate level of outrage over its inclusion--I sacrificed a few minutes of my life researching how long it was in existence, as I had never heard of it, even having had young kids at the time of its birth. Sadly, I was only able to learn that it debuted in 2003.) The east was a fairly clean solve, progressing from north to south, but by no means quickly. The west...probably the less said the better.

I like a difficult Saturday puzzle--practically live for them, in fact. However, hard isn't always quality. For example, I got ZOMBIE MOVIES from crosses but didn't understand until I read the column. Get the joke now, but Saturday or not, head and scarf should have been separate. Headscarf as a compound means only one thing; much too imprecise for the answer. (In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if somebody, somewhere might be mildly offended by this usage.)  Similarly, CINDERELLA UPSET clued by ""calling card,"" not a fan. A calling card is one's trademark. CINDERELLA's were the glass slippers, right? Much too convoluted. And I don't think I can add anything to the conversation that hasn't already been said about the ultimate STINKer: BAD THING...

""SATURDAY PUZZLE — This is the third really gnarly Saturday grid in a row, which makes for a somewhat unsettling pattern.

Lots of nasty comments today. I have been working through the early 2000s Saturdays in the archives, and there have been a number of equally impenetrable puzzles back then.

The clue might as well be “Death in the family “ or “Syphilis” or “An itch you can’t scratch”. All of these are bad things, just as much as a demerit, or more so.

A crossword can be a collaborative effort, but even then, no one is meant to be competing in some imaginary contest. There are no prizes for solving the NY Times puzzle.

When you say ""cheat,"" do you mean that your ego was bruised? I didn't know the name of the Afghan region whose name means ""black cave,"" but now I do, and it wasn't an insult to my intelligence when I had to look it up. I never assume that I know everything or that I can solve every riddle, and when I don't get one, sometimes I think it was unfair, but the lack was really mine, not the riddle maker's.

If puzzles like this one seem too hard, too hard in what way?  That you don't know all the answers and have to get help?  It's a complicated reaction, and if you only like puzzles that may be too hard for others, but are easier for you, you're kidding yourself.

None of the clues in the puzzle were wrong, and some answers were even deceptively simple and some might have been a bit of a stretch, but in the many decades I have spent working crosswords, I never assumed that a constructor was trying to make me ""cheat""—the lack was mine, and I would just have to get better.",27,negative,0.6238795518875122

I liked TORABORA, which I knew from a recent read of a 9/11 book. Bin Laden was pursued by the US military throughout these caves not long after the attack on the towers, but escaped. 

I liked CZARISTS, too. Those interested in the Russian revolution may recognize the political/military faction over the creamy drink.

After the First World War, the entente powers (UK, Canada, USA, Italy, Japan, Czechoslovakia, and others) sent troops to Siberia to support the White Russians in their fight against the Bolsheviks. 

WISER was a fun one, and CROCI gets the pass for me as an interesting bit of trivia that appeared in the only solvable (for me) corner of the grid.

On the inexact language in the cluing that's been pointed out below (IRS, BIG UPSET,... BAD THING was pretty bananas). This is something I'm used to in experimental indie puzzles, but there I can balance it out with the more Gen Z/Millennial fill. Here I had no hope. I agree with some comment below that says that the people defending the puzzle had to contend with Gen Z fill, they'd be singing a diferent tune. 

I'm not insane. I don't think that you can make experimental puzzles that are everyone's cup of tea.

"*Deeep breath…wipe brow with cool rag…*

I just spent over 80 minutes ( which somehow doesn’t feel like so much, now) on that most puzzling puzzle.

Every clue was a puzzle. 
Crosses were puzzles!
Even some (apparently) correct answers puzzled me!

It reminded me of my son’s 5th grade teacher. 
Everyone waited, fearing the classroom assignments in August, because 24 unlucky kids would get Mrs. M.

She was tough. She told these 10-year olds what she expected, and held them to it, no exceptions.
She wasn’t a fun teacher. 
But when my son told me she had shredded his friend’s homework because there was no name on it, I asked,
“Wow…isn’t that pretty harsh?”

He said, “ No. She told us that was the rule. So I always remember to write my name on my papers. It’s fair. “

I come here to be challenged.
Sometimes, I get an Agard or a Weintraub and it’s a fun challenge.

Sometimes, it’s just tough.
I wasn’t giggling today.
But nearly two hours later, I got the gold star and the happy music and I did it fair and square.

So, are NYTXWs getting easier?
Uh, nope.

Loved the grueling challenge.

• When I see Byron’s name atop the grid on a Saturday, it’s time for me to set my brain to Zen mode.  Let me explain.  In the style of yoga (Ashtanga) that I practice, I find that there are certain difficult poses and transitions between poses that I just can’t do if I try too hard.  But if I shut my conscious brain off and let it go still, success follows.  That is, I cede control to my mysterious inner world.  That is how I have to approach a Walden, and it helps greatly.

• I know that a BW Saturday will have world-class twisted cluing, where, when the answer hits me I want to stand, bow, and shake my head in amazement, bathed in pleasure.  Places it happened today: [Pictures where people are headscarfed?] for ZOMBIE MOVIES, [Dodger’s foes, for short] for IRS, and [Can’t we all just git along?] for DOGIES.

• Sometimes the cluing and difficulty hide what is always a feature of a BW Saturday: freshness.  There is always a wealth of answers that have never appeared in the NYT puzzle’s 80 years.  Today there were 11, including IT STINKS, NEED I SAY MORE, RUN PAST, and ZOMBIE MOVIES.

Modern Saturdays are easier than those of olden days because Shortz moved away from these “what’s in my pocket” riddles and made the cluing a tighter, cleverer fit and consequently more solvable, which seems to have enraged some commentators.

BADTHING: A demerit is a bad thing but so is “stubbed toe” or “undercooked chicken” or “sarcastic reply” or “heart attack while skiing”. I want to be able to figure out a puzzle, not guess what the constructor is thinking.

IRS: “Foes” is plural and the IRS is not plural. I think they made the clue plural to misdirect to another ball team and make it harder to solve.  Maybe “Dodgers’ foe, for short” seemed too easy and they loved the clue so much they had to cheat.",24,neutral,0.4664672911167145

The London clue sent my brain into meltdown. I could not think of an insult that would fit. I was still stumped after completing HOSER, but the lightbulb finally came on reading the comments; oh, Canada 🤦‍♀️
All in all this was a fiendish puzzle from a master constructor. So much I didn’t know, a little that I did but was side swiped by the clever clueing. Dogged (as opposed to DOGIE) determination and a lot of guess work got me the gold star. So a classic Saturday puzzle.

I’m surprised and a little sad at the amount of hostility expressed here today. I believe the filling of a crossword is an individual and personal occupation. One person’s walk in the park is another’s hellscape.  But it’s just a game. As an international player, there is always so much US based clueing that I can only guess at, but for me that’s the joy.

This comments section has been overrun by folks who would like the NYT Xword to become a questionnaire with occasional wordplay or a slightly more difficult version of the Parade magazine crossword.  

This sentiment became much more prevalent once the pandemic started and many newer solvers took up crosswords, with a surprising number expecting, demanding even, instant proficiency.  It was most strongly voiced with respect to Thursday puzzles.  And then Sundays.  Now, it’s Saturdays . . . 

I find it disheartening but in the words not of Yogi Berra, It is what is and if it wasn’t what it is, it would probably become what it is anyway.

I know I paint with a broad brush.  Some long-time solvers who like difficult puzzles just didn’t like this puzzle and many newer solvers actually loved it.  But the bottom line for me is a comments section that has lost much of the joy and pleasure it once yielded.  Still a lot to love about it, but for me at least, a lot to make me want to keep my distance.",61,neutral,0.49879857897758484

"I knew GUIDO Van Rossum -- I was writing some Python code for fun earlier today. None of the long clues came easily to me. OPEN MRI and SEACREST got the SE and SW started, although I had bORA BORA for a long time. araBIc MOVIES, strangely enough, didn't work. Neither did barBIE MOVIES. I was thinking of ""Death Comes for the Archbishop"" instead of ""Death Be Not Proud,"" so SONNET didn't come to mind. stroh and tiltED as vibe guesses for PABST and SKEWED only slowed things down even more.

But wait, there's more! I went from hOrsES to DOGIES to pOnIES and then back to DOGIES. OREO ""had"" to be the onetime treat, but that meant the Dodgers' foes had to be aRi or maybe aRz -- iR_ was nonsensical. Finally, with no clue what was going on with 3D (it wasn't tInyfeET), I did an alphabet run -- and got my dunce's tune (© Raymond Holt) on S. Those clues make sense in retrospect, anyway.

My time was just over twice my average, but it did extend my streak to 600. Phew!",17,neutral,0.6237443685531616
"Three Saturday stunners in a row.  Loads of aha! moments due to clever but solvable wordplay.  I don't get the 'obscure' arguments - this is one where you need to tilt your head and squint harder than normal. And since when does time correlate to fun?  It took you longer, you worked harder; but therefore it wasn't fun?  Who cares if it busts your average when the puzzle is this good!

"Sorry to be negative, but I disliked this puzzle. There was no joy in Mudville for this lady right here. I knew it would be a challenge — a welcome Saturday morning activity. This one, though, had so little I could suss out. So it’s a me problem? Yes, probably. However, I am not sure if other constructors will have us face UHOHOREO and the like in future crosswords.

Yesterday’s puzzle was great — I didn’t have a single lookup, yet the synapses were firing left and right! I hope tomorrow’s puzzle is long, complicated, fun and challenging. 

Ok, I’ve set down my tiny violin 🎻. Thanks for your patience.

Obrigada",61,negative,0.5620582699775696
"I had to cheat in every quadrant. I actually knew the general knowledge clues, but I found many of the clues to be more than one degree away from a direct connection.

It felt a bit like the “connections” puzzle where you are called upon to look at words through different lenses to make sense of them.",11,negative,0.5263239145278931

I don't do Mon & Tue (& usually Wed) puzzles, for two reasons. Primarily, they're boring for me because they aren't challenging. A secondary reason is that they make me worse at solving harder puzzles. When I stick to Thu/Fri/Sat puzzles, I am always ready for subtleties and misdirection.

That's just me. I promise that I am not trying to put down people who didn't like this puzzle. But I'm here for tricky clues, interesting fill, and rebuses.",18,positive,0.5626698136329651

"Not a big fan of this Saturday's puzzle. A lot of clever wordplay (the dodgers one in particular) and I enjoyed the two cup clues, and the crossed coat ones, but:
- 3D (Cinderella) was definitely missing a ? and needed something to clue towards the unconventional meaning.
- surely 17A (git) is way too esoteric? First time I've ever seen the word, and crossing with 5A (wine sediment) is mean.
- 43A (home theaters)? I didn't realize this crossword was from 2010.
- I think 7A (white Russians) has been covered plenty in the comments already.",28,neutral,0.47485560178756714
"Auto-check to the rescue.
Sooo hard!

But that's okay. I finished it, learned some things, and tomorrow's another day.

Plus, EMINENCE prompted me to take a listen to ""Eminence Front"" by The Who, which I hadn't heard in a long time (and it's a good song to dance away the puzzle woes.)

Appropriately, it's from their album called ""It's Hard.""

Otherwise, I thought it was terrific a puzzle. When I crisscrossed the fills they all made sense, just sort of after-the-fact (okay, PALACE GUARDS was a little clunky, and UH OH OREO???).  All in all, a clever puzzle.  Tough, but worth the RENT.  There will be those who say IT STINKS, but personally I HOPE there's more TO COME.

"Well, this was certainly a tough one.

As I've said to people before in this space, there may come a point when you realize it's not IF you solve the puzzle, but WHEN.  I've been operating on that basis for quite a while now, but every so often I come across a puzzle that seems at first like it's going to be THE ONE.

This was one such puzzle.

When I'm good and stuck, I fall back on my intuition and guess at answers I don't know, realizing that they might make some crosses obvious, and just as easily, might need to be removed.

It's rare that my intuition has failed me so many times.  I thought the White Russians were FASCISTS, because I had the C from the show that I thought was CATS, which also led me to PIELS instead of PABST.

I had CREED instead of CREDO, which put a double E before before (something something) SEAT, leading me to put LAST FREE SEAT for 36A.  I had CACTI for CROCI at 46A, which told me to put CONE at 48D, and forced me to take it out of 45A.  (At least that one worked out by luck.) Had ALIEN for 26A (WALL-E) because I didn't read the clue carefully, but then took it out because 26D had to be WISER.

It didn't occur to me that the London in 38A was in Ontario.

I did guess right on IT STINKS, UH OH OREO (at least the second half), OPEN MRI, MIENS, B SIDE, DOGIES (after briefly putting HORSES), THUDS.
