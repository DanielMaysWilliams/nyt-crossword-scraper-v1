"Late thought about a possible unusual trick theme. 

Wondered about using punctuation marks in a puzzle; well... it's been done in more than a couple of puzzles - some sample answers: 

NEWYORK,NEWYORK
RACHEL,RACHEL
DR.KILDARE
MR.SANDMAN

But what I considering was using them as homonym for the word that describes them - period, colon, etc. 

What I specifically had in mind was this answer: 

,LAHARRIS

Any other ideas?

"I enjoyed the puzzle, but a monsoon is not a storm. It is a seasonal wind pattern that influences weather. In south Asia, summer monsoon winds blow north and bring warm, moist air from the Indian ocean north into India, causing a rainy season. Winter monsoon winds blow south, bringing air over the Himalayas, where cold temperatures pull most of the moisture out of the air. As the winds continue south into India, the predominantly dry air results in a dry winter season. Both are monsoons.",2,neutral,0.5177956223487854

I cracked up at JOHNS, especially after PEE. I needed the comments when I didn't get the music on completion.  I had CHOkER/TAkE.  I had never heard of CHOLER and choker loosely made sense for [fury], and take certainly made sense for [account].",18,positive,0.9394447803497314

Even though I didn't immediately get the first clue at 1A, like Sam, I knew we were in for a real treat!! I didn't stop smiling from start to finish‚Äîand still have a big dopey grin on my face!

What a clever and sort of meta delight!! I don't keep track but this is definitely one of my very favorite puzzles‚Äîand a real treat for my one year anniversary of working on NYT crosswords (or any crossword). 

I jumped in a year ago just to see if I could... For some reason, I never really thought I would be good at them. I can't say I'm good yet but I've definitely improved and am loving it. This charming puzzle was the icing on my imaginary anniversary cupcake! 

Grateful cheers to all of the brilliant minds that bring us these puzzles, write about these puzzles, and make up this fun and encouraging forum! I've learned a lot from the puzzles and the comments here, especially from our veteran solvers, and I'm grateful!

"In my crawl through the archives, I encountered this morning a little gem from the well-known Frank A. Longo (of 90+ puzzles), a Sunday puzzle from 18 April 1999.

The themers were several long acrosses through the grid, which demanded (due to the theme) lots of personal names and some historical knowledge. But the interesting thing was in the downs. Many of the downs had (seemingly unavoidably) proper names or esoteric words as they crossed the theme entries.

Every one of those clues included capital letters that anagrammed to the answer. A strikingly clever and gentle way to handle what might otherwise have been an annoying mess for many solvers.

I haven‚Äôt seen anything quite like it!",9,positive,0.6830363869667053

"The constructor obviously lavished a great deal of time, effort, and love on the cluing of this puzzle.  There are twelve (12!!!) theme clues -- which is absolutely amazing theme density -- and I thought all of them were smooth as silk.  I define ""smooth"" as an answer completely in sync with the clue, so that the puzzle is completely fair to the solver.  And Jesse has a limited amount of space to play with in his theme clue writing.  I spent some time wondering if I could have pulled this off?  My conclusion:

Mostly worsely
And much less tersely.

I think most solvers will find that this plays quite a bit easier than it looks. The blank spaces seemed a bit formidable when I first perused the theme clues, but once I saw what was happening,  I parsed everything without any hiccups.  And my favorite clue was actually not a themer.  Thanks, Jesse, for that lovely quote on MIDDLE AGE.  I liked this puzzle a lot.",22,positive,0.9400084614753723

Factoid:  there is a sculpture honoring ROENTGEN in Giessen, Germany.  It cleverly depicts rays passing through a solid mass....

Our son was fascinated by one of the Star Trek languages--the (written) KLINGON, I thiink-- and learned it....although it proved to be less than useful, as none of the other kids in his 4th grade class were similarly inclined...

I‚Äôd have one now, just

this one was to construct.

Amazing.

Just fantastic.

"Wow! I think this is the smartest and most fun crossword I‚Äôve ever done. Perfectly tuned for my knowledge and not too many Americanisms for this Brit to be baffled by (though Broadway ‚ÄúAuntie‚Äù had me completely at a loss).

"Oh. Well. My brain found this theme to be divine.  It was given a new kind of puzzle to crack, had to think on its feet, and came alive.  

Normally, in crosswords, you have the clue, and from it you deduce the answer.  But today, in the theme, the clue led to ANOTHER clue, which led to the answer.  Two riddles for the price of one!  When the first theme answer came, it came with a huge aha at how it all worked so perfectly, and amazement at how Jesse came up with it.

But that‚Äôs just one angle.  If you had crosses in the answer, you could guess what it was and try to plug it in the blanks of the original clue, and if it worked, well, for me, it also brought a huge aha, not to mention another jaw-dropping ‚ÄúHow did he think of this?‚Äù.

All I know is that after I got my first theme answer, I couldn‚Äôt wait to get to the others.  My brain was crackling with life, astonishment, and happiness throughout.

Some commenters and a certain blogger complained mightily about SHOVERS.  Hah! This was a highlight for me.  That word embedded in ‚ÄúThey push over stuff‚Äù ‚Äì double hah!  Triple hah!

This was one of my favorite puzzles of the year.  This was a treat.  I bow to you, Jesse, for what you pulled off, and thank you many times over for the exuberance your puzzle ignited in me.",58,positive,0.9264540672302246

"I‚Äôve always been pretty good at coming up with the answers to the phrases on the game show Wheel of Fortune, so maybe that‚Äôs why my time was relatively fast today ‚Äî 35% below average.  I thought it was pretty amazing to come up with these theme clues and answers.",8,positive,0.967021644115448
"Wow - just wow. Amazing piece of construction. Was appropriately puzzled for quite a while, but then a terrific 'aha' moment when I finally tumbled to the trick and then just had a great time working out each of the theme answers.

Just can't imagine how much work it must have taken to find all of those possible theme answers.

Oh, and answer history search today: Wondered how many possible answers there were that have the string of letters NINTH embedded in them. Well... 53 that have appeared in puzzles - a large number of them that embed ""in the"" as part of the answer. There are even 18 fifteen letter answers that embed that string - e.g. singiNINTHerain.

I'm done.

"totally fun puzzle!  i had trouble with death because i spelled golem golum, and had luv for the down clue for a minute - 

i now realize gollum is how you spell the tolkien character - although it's all transliterated anyway, where the golem is concerned.  

but the rest was very do-able and fun!  those momentary challenges are exactly what's fun about puzzling.  a perfect wednesday!

"Fun puzzle! The chicken clue stymied me, and even after the doctoral student hurdle showed me the way it took me till I'd finished the whole thing and re-read all the trick clues to figure it out. If my eyes were better I might have noticed the dashes showed where the word breaks happened. I had the same trouble with DEATH - I tried to parse it as I'D EAT H ... nope, didn't work. Took a while to figure out it was an idEA THat scares those folks.

I'm with you Sam, Jesse Goldberg is a genius!  I couldn't pick one of the fantastic missing letter clues that solve into an appropriate response if I tried. Like choosing a favorite child.

What a tremendous puzzle!  This one approaches or achieves genius in my estimation.  As I solved each theme clues I kept thinking ""oh this one is going to be awkward"" and then after seeing it got an ""aha"" moment as I realized how perfect (and impossible to construct!) it was.

The ""fill"" was great too.  And in spite of all that I still finished it quite quickly.  The puzzle was beyond clever and a joy to play.

Thank you!

Hit a few more crosses, then went to town on the downs. The Kangaroo phrases were absolutely delightful!
