"24 days ago, I started playing the crossword on a whim. I haven‚Äôt always finished them and I‚Äôve used a lot of Check Puzzles and Reveal Squares, but I‚Äôve enjoyed the effort (and reading the comments here). I wanted to share that today is my first gold star! And the fastest I‚Äôve cottoned on (pardon the bunny pun) to the theme. I have a lot on my PLATE now and my streak might be UNEVEN, but ISEE how fun the crossword is and I don‚Äôt plan to stop anytime soon! :)",10,positive,0.9508342742919922

"Fun puzzle, as (almost) always, thanks to brilliant constructors and editors. But what drew me to comment was Sam‚Äôs intro comment  that we have funny ways of measuring things in the US. If you haven‚Äôt seen it already, enjoy this SNL skit called George Washington‚Äôs Dream re: coming up with weights and measures. I‚Äôve rarely laughed so hard‚Ä¶ and have done so a few times since.

"Today's comment is brought to you by the letter N for nostalgia! This puzzle was lovely including the sweet constructor notes about friendship and collaboration! Two of my favorite things! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Another favorite thing, mmm... Choco TACO!! So delicious and fun to eat!! Nostalgic!

The puzzle was pretty smooth sailing with the only pause being putting in bear instead of WORM. I don't remember the last time I had a gummy worm but when I was a cook at a camp, I would sometimes use them to make dirt cup desserts... Oreo crumbs and gummy worms. I haven't thought about that in forever! What a fun other life that was!! 

Happily, I'm still very much connected with the camp but my days of cooking three meals a day for 200 people are long past. Speaking of gravy trains, I did make a lot of gravy! It was not an easy job but it was a terrific one! Nostalgia x 2!

Nostalgia x 3 is that I'm currently listening to American Pie by Don McLean, thanks to LEVEE... Which always reminds me of my dad tinkering in the garage on one of our old clunker cars, or on his beloved Studebaker, as he sang along to this song playing. I'm sure it was only once that I heard it playing while he was out there but it stuck with me. He's been gone a very long time now and I always appreciate these little organic reminders that show up in my life. 

A wonderful puzzle and a delightful theme with three happy memories serving as the brandy soaked cherry on top! My thanks!  ‚ù§Ô∏è",8,positive,0.9785726070404053
"If only I had not misread a clue and turned ‚Äúrevered star‚Äù into ‚Äúreversed star,‚Äù  leading me to put in ‚Äúrats‚Äù instead of ‚Äúidol‚Äù!

"A perfect level of difficulty for Monday with a perfect theme. I finished in 11:59, which is 10:24 faster than my all time average. 

For those starting out on crosswords:

That used to be me in 2021. I started out practicing Mondays (my time used to be 60 min), then Tuesdays when I could do Mondays in under 30 min. Now I only do Wednesdays (< 30 min) and Thursdays (< 60 min) for the most part. I truly delight in the trickery and mockery that Thursdays bring - rebuses seem mundane now.

I don‚Äôt do streaks. I didn‚Äôt grow up in the US so many pop references beat me. I am below average at word games - I have never enjoyed languages and English is my second language. I never thought I would enjoy crosswords. Most of you beginners will have more success than I have. I have seen this among friends who I have introduced to crosswords. 

Persevere, because sheer delights await you around the corner. Good luck!",27,positive,0.9270694255828857

"TIL that you can pause a puzzle, come back to it the next day and your streak is intact! How did I not know this? My inner OCD perfectionist is happy; I entered a couple of answers on Saturday‚Äôs grid, in between setting up for the big shindig. Held said shindig, which was a huge success. Came back to it late yesterday to find the streak holding. Hurrah. Ditto Sunday‚Äôs grid. Finished today after clearing up post party and saying farewell to the late hangers on last night. Some people don‚Äôt know when it‚Äôs time to leave.
Ah, the grids. Saturday was good, Sunday was a nightmare. I have dyscalculia so this was fighting in the dark with both hands behind my back. Not fun at all.
Today was fun. A clean grid with just enough bite that I didn‚Äôt get the revealer til quite late. I need another nap now. This celebration lark gets harder as you get older.",8,positive,0.9155206680297852
"Well, that's DONE and OVER with.

"Although I guessed the Reveal before putting pen to paper, the exact form was still in question (A HOP, SKIP, AND JUMP?) so it was fun to work that out, and even working bottom to top did not spoil the fun as the Across hints were revealed.

DHubby's collection of Old 78's includes a few with flaws that cause SKIPs; for big hits, it can be difficult to find one in good condition.  We've been known to sort through great stacks of RECORDS in the hot loft of a barn.  (The Hunt was great fun back then...)

And how timely to find 50D, a reminder of a recent puzzle that created ""a learning opportunity.""

"Fun Monday puzzle. Bit of a slow start for me but then came together pretty smoothly. Working out the reveal was a really nice 'aha' moment. Looking forward to more from our new constructors. 

Answer history search today was for the sequence of letters in our constructors' names. Just a couple of finds: 

BIEG? 
The only actual appearance of that sequence was: 
TONYOBIEGRAMMY -  in a 1985 puzzle. 

But the sequence also appears in....
BOBBIEGENTRY and
DOBIEGILLIS 
 
But neither of those has ever been in a puzzle. 

And...

NETICK appears in variations of AIRPLANETICKET(s), but...

None of those have ever been an answer in any puzzle. 

I'm done.

"What a lovely moment this puzzle gave me.

I had uncovered the three theme answers and was trying to guess the revealer, having purposely left it blank.  I was getting nowhere.  But then I saw that each of these things ‚Äì the bunny, broken record, and skater ‚Äì jumped.

So, I started thinking of phrases with ‚Äújump‚Äù, ‚Äújumper‚Äù, ‚Äújumping‚Äù, and still, nothing worked. Somewhere in all this I thought that Peter Cottontail, according to the song, actually hopped, and that a broken record actually skips, but that ‚Äúhop‚Äù and ‚Äúskip‚Äù don‚Äôt apply to all three theme answers, and dropped that line of thinking.

So, when I finally gave up after this swirl of effort, and uncovered HOP, SKIP, AND JUMP, my reaction was, ‚ÄúOh, yes, that‚Äôs IT, it‚Äôs exactly right, and it‚Äôs such a gorgeous phrase!‚Äù  It was one of those rare times in this crazy world where everything stops and feels perfect.  

What a lovely moment to start the day and week with!

Thank you for that, Sala and Emily.  Thank you also for a puzzle that had clues that made me think, to balance the many Monday foothold clues, not to mention the big smile you gave me with the dook GOON TOUR.  

Congratulations on your debut, and brava!",22,positive,0.6046032905578613

It took Sam's explanation to straighten me out, as I'd completely missed the twist to the themers vis √† vis the revealer.

And before I had the crosses for CHOCO____ , I really wanted it to be CHOCO LOCO. That's what I would have named a fun treat anyway.
