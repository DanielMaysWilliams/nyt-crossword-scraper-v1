1!=1
2!=1x2=2
3!=1x2x3=6

Thus, we have:

"I am once again calling on the NYT to explain why there is such uncertainty about moderation for this column.

We are all paying for this service.  Why shouldn't we have some information about what is expected of us concerning posts?

Everyone posting here knows has had comments simply fail to appear, even with ""emu padding"" (which makes a lot of posts look like pathetic poems in a local poetry contest).  We all know how annoying it can be to try to carry on some sort of dialogue--the NYT supposedly encourages this.

Yet even when the dialogue is absolutely free of--horrors--opinions, there simply is no way of knowing.  In fact, some threads seem to just be cut off.  Period.  No posts accepted.  No explanation.  Though well within the bounds of civility, though no violations of the comment guidelines, simply not accepted.

Why is this, NYT?  Why can't we, paying customers all, get any information?

Second pass through, I started to fill in answers, with a chuckle here (AD NAUSEAM) and an answer there (REN FAIRE) and I was on my way.

I guess that's where you deliberately fall and trust that someone will catch you?  We didn't have such activities at the companies I worked for (they didn't invite us to ""retreats"" either) and thank heavens they didn't.  Lots of luck getting ME to fall deliberately!!!  I don't trust you or you or you or anyone in such an absurd endeavor.  I have spent my entire life trying really, really hard NOT to fall and that pursuit has become even more all-consuming at the advanced age that I have now reached.  

Will your company fire you if you refuse to TRUST FALL?

Minor rant coming about two very rude clue/answers:

1) I would clue 35A (A LITTLE HELP HERE) thusly: ""Rude demand for assistance that's likely to be ignored.""  Has anyone ever heard of asking CAN YOU PLEASE HELP ME?

• This is a lovely grid design, sporting 15 bigs (answers of eight letters or more), which can bring such color to the answer set, and they do today, my favorites being A LITTLE HELP HERE, I NEED TO RUN, TABBY CAT, and TRUST FALL.  This grid design, BTW, has never been used in a Times puzzle before.
• Also bringing color are eight NYT puzzle debuts (Hi, @RIA!), all of which are bigs, including the ones I just mentioned, all worthy additions to the oeuvre.
• I like the symmetrical mini-story of TRUST FALL / A LITTLE HELP HERE / LET’S PARTY!
• Sweet PuzzPair© of SHRUG abutting YESNO.
• TSA has shown up in the major crossword venues more than 500 times, but never with the clue or anything like the clue [Air force?].  Bravo!
• A very-rare-in-crosswords six letter palindrome (HEHHEH)!
