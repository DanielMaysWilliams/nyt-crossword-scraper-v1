"Two thoughts: 

1) Wounded knee, even though knee was not capitalized, is just a poor attempt at a misdirection and absolutely in poor taste. Editors and writer all share blame.

"Well I just made what I think is a bit of an interesting discovery. It had always been my understanding that the comment section would close at some point for additional comments. The exact timing seemed to be a bit variable. Well today I was looking at a comment section from about 4 years ago on ASTROPOP and  found that I was able to send a reply to DC  from Weston this many years later. To confirm it wasn’t my imagination, I did an experiment. The very first thread from last night related to the Kellogg School and if they in fact awarded MBAs. BA offered a link to the school confirming they did. In a reply, I pointed out that exactly one year ago the same discussion came up about Sloan and once again BA provided a link to Sloan. I included a link to that thread from a year ago.

"I enjoyed the puzzle and the theme. While the NE was my last area to get, I found it fair and doable with crosses. I didn't know FANDUEL but having all the crosses except TINCT figured out, it was easy to assume the N, which helped me finish off TINCT for some happy music. 

That section also contained some of my favorites: MATCH MAKERS, BUTTONS, and SUMNER. 

Super loved the references to two of my favorites: Princess Bride and Star Trek! Only 209 more years until good ole James T. Kirk is born! Can't wait!! Though I'm even more excited for Jean Luc Picard to be born!! 😉

On a different note, I'm not very nitty or pearl clutchy about clues typically, and I really love puns and word play, but I do agree with some others here about the ""Wounded knee site"" clue for ACL at 40D. Some things will never be funny or cute. I found this to be in very poor taste—as I would jokey references to the sites of more modern mass murders. I'll hope for the best—that perhaps referencing it at all might make more people aware, if they aren't already, but still...  

To a less disturbing degree, this has also been covered but it took me way too long to accept that TAO was the answer to Confucian philosophy.

In 1506, an ancient Roman sculpture was unearthed in a vineyard near Rome and caused great excitement: the Pope even sent Michelangelo to the site to make the first drawings of it. It was not just any old sculpture but one that Pliny himself extolled as one of the greatest works of art of his time.  It has been on display at The Vatican ever since. The sculpture depicts the Trojan philosopher & priest Laocoön and his sons Antiphantes and Thymbraeus being attacked by sea serpents. In the 18th century, a dispute between the German art critic Winckelman and the author Lessing regarding the expression of agony on Laocoon's face led to Lessing's composing ""Laocoon,"" an important essay in which the serpent becomes, for Lessing,  a complex metaphor for the constraints placed on artists and intellectuals. 

Don't get me started on The Princess Bride - the book AND the movie are both fantastic!

I thought the theme was tight and well constructed. I got the gist of it from the first themed clue, but even then the answers weren't gimmes.  I was surprised at how many compound words could be parsed into common phrases all linked with ""and"". Amazing!

The hardest one for me was HANDHOLD. The whole NE corner was a little tricky, I had two wrong answers filled with ""tinge"" and ""edges"" which made getting the unknown names like MEHTA, SUMNER, and FANDUEL harder. Since I had a G with ""edges"", I thought the ""remote possibilities"" answer ended in ING.  Realizing the answer should be plural helped me fix my mistakes and finally clear up that section.

I counted 7 Ks (and a few Cs with a K sound), I don't know if this is an unusual number, but it stood out to me.",33,positive,0.750163197517395
"49A made me laugh out-loud for some reason.  I did not expect that answer at all. I was hung up on some version of LAG but could not get the tense right.  So when SAT hit me on the crosses, I had this weird image which I will not describe in the NYT.",7,negative,0.7287861108779907

"One of my first cars was a Toyota PASEO, which made me giggle as I got it while in my second semester of Spanish. Eventually the fifth gear stopped working and the axel almost made me lose a tire and that made me think the name was not coincidence.",13,neutral,0.4183908700942993
"As this puzzle needed SIX cheats, it felt more like a Thursday.  Lots of trick clues:  ""Remote possibilities"" (Buttons!) ""Entrees"" (Ins?!!!!?), for instance. But the clever theme and the poem Wiegmann wrote won me over.",22,positive,0.7002120614051819
"Oof, the MEHTA/INS/TINCT/HANDHOLD section was rough. Wasn't familiar with the non culinary use of entree, or what I assume is a shortening of tincture. HANDHOLD, meanwhile was the weakest of the theme answers. Good theme though",65,negative,0.8690584301948547

Not bad at all. I'm always impressed with themes whose answers find linguistic relationships with pairs of words. Clever theme and good fill.,19,positive,0.9633288383483887
