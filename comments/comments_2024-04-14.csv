"The sound you may have heard could have been clumps of my hair hitting the floor while I was tearing it out trying to find my error.

"Like many of you, I found this to be a lovely puzzle. Sadly for me, I did not figure out the before/after part of the theme until I read the column. Very cool! 

I did pick up on the circled letters and that helped me fill some of them out but no advantage was had for me by the after. I also didn't have a problem with any of the ""after"" entries, other than PORE at 75D, for which I kept acne for quite a while. I was quite slowed down by keeping ups instead of DHL at 37A and capital instead of OTTOMAN at 24A. When it came down to the wire, I had to remove it because I was pretty sure of CORPOREAL. A few tough crossings for me led to just a few lookups‚Äîcan't wait to someday go a whole week without lookups!
