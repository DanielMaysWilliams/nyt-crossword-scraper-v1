And I'm a bit ashamed of myself as one who often has a book in front of my face I couldn't think what those squiggly lines meant. Didn't get curl up until reading the blog. But I'm more likely to sprawl out with one.",2,positive,0.8752725720405579
"Today's puzzle was very enjoyable! Like others, I had some difficulty seeing the differently shaded or shaped or whatever squares on my phone but it all worked out and I thought it was a very fun idea! Tilted is what gave it away for me.

The Northwest corner gave me some slow down, and strangely, though martinis (GIN, If I must specify) are my favorite adult beverage, I just couldn't see it there in the middle for the longest time! It was the last letter I filled in. Crazy!! 

I blame it on it being Thursday and not being able to see a puzzle through in one sitting because of it being my craziest work day every week.

But also, it might just be because I'm ___-brained (not smart)....  

Which is a clue from a very fun puzzle I just did in the archives, May 23, 2023. It was the very last thing to fall for me. 

And I had two crossings! And it was only three letters long! I've been done with work for a few hours so I'm not sure what to think otherwise! Yikes!!  üòÇ

I cracked myself up with that one! But also it's a super fun and fast puzzle! I really liked the little trick to the theme. If you haven't done it yet and you don't mind what some call a gimmick, it's worth taking a look at!",2,positive,0.9331211447715759

I always thought ZEDONK was Whoopie Goldberg's keister. No, wait, that was BADONK-A-DONK. (I don't even watch daytime television, but I heard Sherri Shepherd refer to it as such live on The View once, and I find I can't shake that booty synonym.)",4,positive,0.9477422833442688

"I'm swinging back by to honor Don Quixote, that memorable character who saw windmills as giants/monsters to be fought against and defeated.

I first watched the movie, ""Man of La Mancha"" as a ten-year-old, and I was moved then ‚Äìas I am now ‚Äì by Peter O'Tooles' poignant rendition of ""The Impossible Dream"":

https://youtu.be/oo7VlD66ISM?feature=shared

Maybe it's the powerful crescendo, maybe the beautiful lyrics, and possibly both that make me hold this music close to my heart...

To dream the impossible dream
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
And to run where the brave dare not go
To right the unrightable wrong
And to love pure and chaste from afar
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star
This is my quest
To follow that star
No matter how hopeless
No matter how far
To fight for the right
Without question or pause
To be willing to march, march into Hell
For that Heavenly cause
And I know if I'll only be true
To this glorious quest
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm
When I'm laid to my rest
And the world will be better for this
That one man, scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable star

"I figured out the theme.

I entered the rebus-y ""two word"" solutions.

The completed puzzle stared back at me, indifferent to my triumph. Nary a hint of congratulations.

I edited the rebus-y cells, eliminating in each the space between the two words.

Still nothing.

I edited the rebus-y cells AGAIN, removing the descriptive term entirely, against all reason & intuition.

Voila?

"This puzzle was rich with lovely answers.  All the theme answers (counting their graphic first words) had zing, then in addition, there were these beauties: ZEDONK, ONE POT MEAL, WHY AM I HERE, OLD MONEY, ENMITY.

The first three are NYT debut answers. The four theme answers (with or without the graphic first word) are debuts as well.  The result is a grid shimmering with freshness, answers and clues never seen before.

That‚Äôs the difference between ‚Äújust another puzzle‚Äù and one that stands out.

Joe‚Äôs last NYT puzzle had a visual element as well, but in the clues.  For instance, the clue for HEBREW NATIONAL was the word ‚Äúnational‚Äù written in Hebrew, and the clue for CHINESE CHECKERS was ‚Äúcheckers‚Äù written in Chinese.
