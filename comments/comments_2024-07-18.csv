I'm getting better at deleting what doesn't serve me, such as sin instead of ERR, and at trusting that though I didn't know what exactly was going on at first, I could work it out if I just keep at filling and not worrying about the trick just yet. That may not always be the case for me, that I can work it out myself, and that's okay too, but it was the case today!

"For a Thursday puzzle this is appropriately gimmicky (and brain-teasingly tricky), and usually I delight in this weekday's puzzles. But ... after I solved this one, in terms of filling in the grid, I felt stymied. That is, I was unable to see/grasp the operating gimmick (or theme, as you prefer). 

So I then read about it here—and yes, I now see how the top row answers link up to down columns. But here's what  still puzzles me:

Is there any logical basis for those links from the top-row answers to the particular down answers they link to? I.e., why do the first two criss-cross—a nice visual symmetry— leaving the third one to link up to an answer at the bottom of the grid? Am I missing something in the particular geometry? 

In terms of the actual fill, is there any connective significance to those two long down-answer phrases?  I gather not.  (As a pair, they certainly do not seem to link up to the starry answers across the top of the grid.)

Sure, I know that all clever crossword puzzles are going to have some arbitrariness, no matter how brilliantly they are laid out. But this one just didn't click the way so many of them have done in the past. 

Oh well, there's always tomorrow ... and next Thursday .....

"As I continue to press through the archives in order, I had a great lesson in the “keep on thinking” method this morning. Doing Frank A. Longo’s Friday puzzle of January 23, 1999, I had it all filled in, but the lower left corner was nearly blank. I had one entry and three letters in the link to the body of the puzzle and nothing else.

In that part of the grid, the top and left are both easily googled facts, and a third answer joins that list. The temptation grew stronger to just look those three names up - or even just one of them - to give a foothold in that quadrant. It was my decision to make: google and move along, or continue to think about the other answers until something dawned.

And it did dawn, and the answers came. The last square I filled was a guess (a good one, it turned out) at a crossing of two of the names.

"I thought this was a wonderfully creative puzzle, but at least from the first few comments, I gather there's a lot of frustration. I'm not sure why so many commenters get their knickers in a twist about this stuff.  Anyone in the least familiar with the Indianapolis 500 (and I probably qualify as ""least familiar"", never having paid it much attention and never having watched any of the race) knows that ""Gentlemen, start your engines"" is part of the lore. Everything these days seems to be a hot button for some people to gripe about, but this is just cultural literacy, as much as the meaning of a ""No Vacancy"" sign at a motel, although I haven't seen one of those in a while.

The point is that once you realize that there's something going on with the first row entries (and duh, the circled letters, people), and the unclued down entries (hey, they also begin with circled letters), it's simply a matter of working through the grid until your Aha! moment arrives. And trust me, it does. I just stumbled along until it did.

"It would be really, really helpful if I knew what a WORMHOLE is and how it works.

Question #1: Can a WORMHOLE, whatever it is, go in any direction and end up anywhere at all? 

Question #2:  Does a WORMHOLE -- one that's (seemingly) represented by two letters in one square -- leave it's second letter in the original square or move it to the empty square at the beginning of the completing phrase?

It's all so confusing.

Luckily, I solve on paper, so for me it doesn't matter.  I actually had left the ""T"" of START YOUR ENGINES in its original square and had done the same for the ""O"" of COME TO JESUS MOMENT.  But then I moved the ""C"" of VACANCY to the empty, unchecked square.  I realized that I had also left the ""C"" in its original space.

On an app, I probably would have been awarded a DNF until I corrected.  On paper, I decided I'd solved the darn thing and didn't care all that much where those three letters were meant to go.

"This is Kareem’s third NYT puzzle.  You may remember his first, with theme answers like BRONTO and STEGO in gray, and the revealer was [Writer’s reference ... or what each row of shaded letters is missing], for THESAURUS.  You may also remember his last, five weeks ago, in which all 14 of the three-letter answers were SET.  

Today, my Libra YEN for equilibrium was perfectly satisfied by the placement of the wormhole answers.  The opening words of the those answers are all in the top row, where the left-to-right word counts are 4-5-4, giving it a palindromic balanced feel.  The three vertical finishes of the theme answers are perfectly symmetrical, with the left-to-right word count of 12-5-12, palindromic as well.  

“Ahh,” says my Liba sensibilities, and “Ooh,” says my appreciation for skilled puzzlemaking.

My YEN for beauty was stoked by ASIAGO, SPY RING, SYNAPSE, COME TO JESUS MOMENT, and START YOUR ENGINES.

Funny moment when looking over the finished grid and mis-parsing 52A as the long-living palm, the EON SAGO.

Kareem, after your last puzzle, I posted that you may be one of those constructors with the “it” factor, with the potential to become a Crosslandia star.
