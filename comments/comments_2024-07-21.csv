"Well, I was charmed by this theme.  It felt erudite and so un-crossword-theme-like as to be rebellious.  Rebellious and erudite, these are two of my happy buttons.

Then, three of the theme answers were so familiar to me that they popped right in with few crosses, which felt good.   One of them I‚Äôd heard of in the past but couldn‚Äôt retrieve right off, but when I finally did, that felt good.  One of them I‚Äôd never heard of before and setting it down thanks to crosses felt mighty good.

And that huge spanner across the middle, the Latin one, oh, I kinda remembered it but didn‚Äôt know it exactly and no way was I going to enter squares with confidence, so watching it take shape, with the help of crossing answers, and having it become clearer and clearer, until it did fill in and I knew it was right ‚Äì well, that was a triumph.

The theme was the bones of this puzzle, and when the bones charm me, all nits fly out the window, and little joys, like [Title awarded after a match?] for MRS, and [Gift tied together with string] for LEI, both lovely, and both original for answers that have appeared hundreds of times ‚Äì become amplified.

Love the clues for BRUNO and I DO. 62A threw me for a while; 17 is the minimum age you can start lessons over here, so the answer wasn‚Äôt immediately obvious to me.
Despite 2D and 3D being gimmes I couldn‚Äôt fathom out 19A til the final cross. The phrase is never going to sound like that in any regional British accent, but once seen it was phonetically clear.

MUSEUM THOUGHTS
Portrait of a Lady (c. 75 A.D.) 

Julia to the barber went
And got herself a permanent.
Since the perm was unsurpassed,
""Fine!"" she said. ""But will it last?""
(I approximate the sense
Of ""Estne vere permanens?"")
Then the vehement coiffeur,
Warmly reassuring her,
Guaranteed with confidence
The permanence of permanents.

Rome is gone and all her pride,
Still the dainty curls abide;
Venus, Mars, and Jove are dead,
Still remains the lovely head.

Let a thousand years go by,
Let our gods and empires die,
Time will never set a term
To the life of Julia's perm.

Iste capitis ornatus.

The two assertions in the clue are of the forms P->Q and !Q->!P respectively. Thats not NTS, nor is it even a fallacy.
