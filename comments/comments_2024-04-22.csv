""Ages and ages - EON"" stuck out to me. Surely it should be EONS? Or AN EON? But not just EON. Even knowing the answer it looks odd in my opinion.

No apology necessary on ""quip of Theseus."" I thought it was a brilliant play on words, and I vote that it become the new name for ""word ladders.""

The question, for philosophers, is, ""Is it the same ship after all these repairs?  If not, when did it became a different ship?  Only after the last repair?  After the first repair???""

So there I was munching on brunch, just a little lox and a shmear, when I started this Monday puzzle. I was recovering from the clamor & cacophony of complaints that surrounded the Saturday puzzle, a veritable uproar/ mishmash of words, when I opened the Monday grid. Then I noticed the tag on my three-piece suit's front collar was falling off. Oh well. I took a little sip of my Carling lager (üé∂""Mabel!"") to assuage this mild annoyance (yes, I don formal dress for solo brunches & allow myself hard beverages after 12N). ‚Ä¶Again, this all may or may not be a [8D].

I shook my head again about yesterday's clamor (not necessarily disagreeing with some of that valid criticism) & started on today's puzzle. A passing dragon (I live in an interesting neighborhood) glanced nonchalantly at me, nodded & tossed off a casual ""Hey babe"". This lifted my spirits & I dug into the puzzle.

It was awfully warm in my apartment/ mansion so I took off a whole bunch of layers until I giggled to notice I'd taken it all off! Hastily I put the bandana back on but then paused & reconsidered; feeling bold, I tossed the bandana onto the couch beside me. After all, if one can't be comfortable in one's own home, where CAN one?

To truly get into the puzzle, I reached into my TARDIS cabinet for some choice reefer (c'mon, remember this really may all be one giant 8D!]. I indulged in this for a short while & was presently toasted.>>>",6,neutral,0.8143261075019836
