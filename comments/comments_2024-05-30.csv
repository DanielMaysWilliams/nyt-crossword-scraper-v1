"This is the first time I've done a puzzle with a rebus and actually filled in the revealer and the rebuses without any help or hints! I get the hype now, how satisfyingg.

I hated them before because it never even crossed my mind when or how to try a rebus, leaving me stuck and mad. But this one kinda naturally came about which put a smile on my face :)",20,positive,0.9621317982673645
"This is about as perfect a puzzle as I can imagine. Lots of fun fill, but I suspected something was up in the southeast corner when I couldn’t fit anything in for Unpaid debt. I’ve learned to be patient and just keep going, while staying alert for a rebus. This is Thursday after all. Once I got the long revealer, the jig was up and I romped through the rest. I especially like when the theme helps keep solve other clues. The last to fall was EARNER. Thanks for the great fun!",15,positive,0.8294872641563416
"I’ve only been solving daily for a few months (but am working my way through the archive) so it may be premature to ask, but at what point will I ever remember that rebuses are an option?!
I actually thought of the answers to most of the rebus-ed(?) clues, but moved on because they didn’t fit. Rebus didn’t even occur to me. Why!? Headsmack, facepalm, etc. Ugh.",2,negative,0.47736307978630066
"I've never commented here before. I thought I'd give it a shot today because I just scored my first 100 day streak AND had a rebus puzzle that didn't make me want to scream!  Great puzzle, thank you!",43,positive,0.9714956879615784
"Outlander is an awesome series but the books are even better! (especially if you have Sam Heughan in your mind when reading about Jamie) I recommend listening to the Outlander books on tape. The reader, Davina Porter, is fabulous.",7,positive,0.9838902354240417
