"This went by pretty quickly, but I still had enough trouble in the NE to threaten my Wednesday streak. Would never have gotten 18A on my own, expected 9A to refer to those rods they use to clean guns until I read the Wikipedia article on rifles and AMMO came to me, and kept leaning towards TBd for 23A despite it potentially committing a crossword faux-pas (in fact because of it; if it's not yet *determined* shouldn't you use the acronym meaning ""to be *determined*?""), and so initially filled 12D as ON idLE before seeing if the other option for 23A would work.

"[Orchestral group pitched to C] is an accurate, but odd, way to clue OBOES. What does that mean? Well, many wind instruments are ""transposing"" instruments, ""pitched"" *in* keys other than C--saxophones and most clarinets, for instance. The four most common sizes/keys of clarinets, for example, are E-flat, B-flat, A, and B-flat basso. Different sizes, different keys, different ranges. But now, what does *that* mean? It means that if you play a notated C on a B-flat clarinet, for instance, it would sound as the B-flat below; playing the same C in an E-flat clarinet would sound as the E-flat above. But, you ask, why would anyone want to do that? Well, to cause consternation for students of music composition, for one; but mainly, so that the same, or similar, fingering system can be used for multiple instruments, even in different families--the performer only has to learn one. A studio musician might have four saxophones, a clarinet or two, and a flute, and play all interchangeably, when required. (A friend of mine, last Sunday, told me he has given names to all his saxophones, but not his flute--go figure).

Anyway, back to OBOES--most flutes and oboes are pitched ""in C""--fingering a notated C produces a sounding C.  But not all--the English Horn (technically a tenor oboe, and included in that orchestral family) and the (less common) Oboe d'Amore are pitched in F and A, respectively.

"I especially like this out-there theme – the imaginary game of ODDBALL. As I see it, it would have no rules (otherwise it would cease to become odd) (Hi, @CLM!)), and as every game would be so different from every other, it would become a creative performance that people want to see.  ODDBALL games could be presented on YouTube and the games with the most views would become the winners.  But I digress…

Other things I liked about this puzzle:
• Learning little new things about FROST, POE, INUIT ART, and the constellation LEO.   
• Presence of hot (FIRE, MOLTEN LAVA, SALSA, ASH) and cold (FROST, ICE IT).
• Fauna-related answers: LARVA, EEL, BEE, CAT, ARK, LEO.
• CAT crossing CAT.
• ALLAH and ALLA.

I was also inspired by the constructor’s tenacity, that this is a debut following a long string of rejections.
