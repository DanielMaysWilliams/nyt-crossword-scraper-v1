"Been super busy so haven’t commented in a while. 

But I had to add my two cents today to say: This was a great Thursday puzzle: just devious enough to be a challenge, but with a revealer that told you where to look for the solution. 

And while everyone else seems too busy debating the theme to comment on anything else, I thought the full was quite lively for a Thursday. Just looking at the some of the longer entries: CAN WE NOT, KNUCKLED, TOETAPS, AMALGAM, PANSEAR.

People, if you don’t like tricky themes, save yourself the trouble and us the grief, and find something else to do on Thursdays! Leave it to those of us who love the challenge. 

And Ella, don’t listen to the haters. Those of us with the chops to do it enjoyed it immensely.",3,positive,0.6885266304016113

"I don't get all the hate, so I feel the need to post here. I absolutely LOVED this puzzle. I got the revealer ANY TAKERS right away, and knew that it was crucial to understanding the puzzle. I kept rereading the clue and answer and could not make sense of how it was helpful.

I got HEADSTO through the crosses (after epitaph didn't fit), and had my first aha! moment: the revealer is telling is to take away NE. Ok, so how do I make this work...

I couldn't solve ""on the same side"" directly, but given the blanks ALL I NEED seemed to fit. It didn't make sense, but oh well.

And as I left and came back and left and came back to this puzzle I reread ""all I need"" without the NE and aha! #2 came! The clue and answer made sense by taking away NE. The 2 separate satisfying moments of the solve were when these lightbulbs went off, transplanting NE from one word to the other, and voila the world made sense again.

A very satisfying solve, and still just under my Thursday average. I would love to see more like this.",15,positive,0.7939677238464355
"This was devilishly clever and a serious challenge for me, but I enjoyed it quite a bit.

My head was spinning as I started to see how things might work.

I should have read the revealer more carefully from the get go, as I didn't get the reversal for a while. So things sort of fell in place but were still squirrelly (spelling?).

But once I got the trick, it was a lot of fun.

I gotta say that the Frank Sinatra clue was really hard to parse for me since I didn't know that particular factoid. (It was fun to learn it.) 

Now if the NYT website would just stop being so stupid about whether I am logged in and what I should be able to do when I am logged in...

Well I read a lot of the comments but then the app crashed and I didn't feel like going back and figuring out where I left off because I'm kind of tired and crabby. Probably for the best because I was starting to feel a little bit like CAN WE NOT.... 😉  Sounds like it's split as Thursday tricks so often are, anyhow. You can count me as a fan. 

The trick was fun for me, as usual. It started to come together for me with FARGO__ And then I went to figure out the revealer, so that helped.  I also appreciated 21 across for its bear advice! 

I can't have some bear advice and not leave you a Far Side cartoon. What kind of monster would I be!?

Anyhow, SZA crossing ZETA and A S S was very brutal for me. I wasn't sure if it was going to be bETA or ZETA, so I left the first letter blank and hoped it would make sense to me at some point. It never did...  But when I didn't get happy music with the b, I switched it to z and voila!

"Nice gimmick!  Took me a while.  I think my entry point was FARGO?? but I needed to solve for ANYTAKERS before I really understood.  Fortunately I got it without quite getting it (I had enough crossing letters to fill it in) and the ""phonetic"" in the clue really helped.  

With the Sinatra clue I thought ""TOMBSTO""(NE) ... but that didn't work with the Down clues, then I realized that the word or phrase that lost the NE still had to make sense, so HEADSTO(NE) it was!

Of course, I would expect nothing less from the NYT crossword, it's always elegant.

One quibble - I think ""seating a jury"" might have been a better clue for IMPANELING than ""selecting for a jury"" - especially since IMPA(NE)LING and VOIRDIRE have the same number of letters.  Just sayin'.

That was my last section that I filled, and by the final time I tackled it after several passes I knew the answer needed to have an NE in it so VOIRDIRE wouldn't work.

So, it was a bootstrap process but very well clued and tight.  Congrats to the constructor!",6,positive,0.8331165313720703

2) Discovering rebuses.  It was a thunderclap when I first learned about them.  They don't jump out at me, but there's a cumulative indication that they're there, because so many things aren't quite right without them.

3) Discovering that there are tricks even more subtle than rebuses.  One day I could not do a puzzle, and I found that the answers weren't just a linear string, up or down, but that the word could change directions.  This is a new one on me--letters that can tunnel from one answer to another.

"As with others the NW was the toughest nut to crack for pretty much the same reasons in this otherwise fun and challenging outing.   Gave me the opportunity to climb into this rabbit hole: 

""The word “empanel” is derived from the Old French empaneller which is itself derived from the diminutive form of the Latin word pannus and the prefix in.  A pannellus is a little piece of cloth and the prefix in is used to denote in or on.  Thus, to empanel is to put on a piece of cloth.  Sir William Blackstone makes this clear in Book III, Chapter 23 of his Commentaries on the Laws of England:

And he returns the names of the jurors in a panel (a little pane, or oblong piece of parchment) annexed to the writ.

The jury is still out on the correct spelling. The use of the prefix “em” is closer to the word’s French origins.  After all, it wasn’t until the reign of Charles II that Parliament required that trials be conducted in English.  “Em” remained good enough for Mark Twain in his travelogue, Roughing It:

When the peremptory challenges were all exhausted, a jury of twelve men were empaneled-a jury who swore that they had neither heard, read, talked about, nor expressed an opinion concerning a murder which the very cattle in the corrals, the Indians in the sagebrush, and the stones in the street were cognizant of!""",6,neutral,0.6014594435691833

I was an alternate juror at a rather famous capital murder case that ran for six weeks. During that time, we alternates were even sequestered from the primary jurors. It was a horror show. From the Federal courthouse in downtown Brooklyn they bused us to a hotel in Staten Island. No TV, no radio, no other human contact other than having to share a hotel room with the two other women alternates, one of whom had questionable mental competence.
