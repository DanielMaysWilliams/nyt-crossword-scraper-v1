"Early in January, I mentioned here that I had a perrenial New Year's resolution to attempt a Shakespeare play that I hadn't read in each month.  Every previous year had been a failure.  Two commentators challenged me to follow through this time and would join in the effort.  No pressure, heh, heh.

January went fine.  Then I discovered that the text of a play that I thought I knew well began with a prologue or Induction that I had never before encountered despite seeing several film, TV, and video performances.  That's how The Taming of the Shrew became February's project.

I.  Some observations on the difficulty of reading one of the plays:

1.  The text is inert.  A performance is brought to life by the Director's vision and the actors' delivery. Whether a line is spoken litteraly or tongue-in-cheek is a matter of interpretation.  That's up for the reader to decide.  Shakespeare often complicates this with liberal use of puns and double entendre. 
2.  Shakespeare is fond of disguise, impersonation, and assumed names.  Actors' physical attributes make it easier to know Gremio from Grumio; or Lucentio as Cambio; and Tranio as Lucentio.
3.  Shakespeare's language.  Here is the very first line :  
 SLY:  I'll feeeze you, in faith.
  HOSTESS:  A pair of stocks, you rogue. 
The drunkard Sly has broken two glasses and threatens to ""do for, fix, or settle the hash of"" the Hostess.

I'll deal with the problems of historical and social norms later.",1,neutral,0.6380037665367126

"Curse my beautiful fingernails! 

I rarely do anything fancy with my nails and generally keep them short but I had a fancy thing to attend this weekend and so they are a bit long and beautifully clunky now, which kept me from a personal best (for any day) by almost a minute. I don't know how people who always have their nails done handle practical life things so gracefully. Ah well! I'M OK!

Fun and breezy puzzle! But I'd not heard of STINKY TOFU or SLINKY DOG before, so they must not exist and shouldn't have been in here! (WINKY FACE! WINKY FACE! I jest!) I really hadn't, but they were all but filled in by the time I came back to them, so no problem there. 

EASY AS made me a little :-(  though... it reminded me of the time when I got a B+ in an EASY A college class. It was jazz dance in my final semester.... Jazz dance, for Pete's sake! Jazz dance kept me from graduating summa cum laude! Even an A-minus would have gotten me there.  I wouldn't say I'm in AGONY over it still, but it certainly is a nagging decades-long occasional bitterness. Wish I could have taken underwater basket weaving instead but alas, I needed the Phys-ed credit. 

Well, my fancy nails and I better end this SAGA and get back to work. Thanks for a really nice puzzle, Nate!",7,negative,0.5242813229560852

"Well, fellow NTY crossword solvers, perhaps I should have my head examined, but I went to the ""Puzzle Personality"" Quiz on this website to find out my very own Puzzle Personality.  Since there's no place for  comments provided over there, I think I'll complain over here.

Quiz #1 listed no option that I would do or say or think in a million years.  But the problem with these online quizzes is they won't let you go to the next question until you've answered the previous one.  So I closed my eyes and put a checkmark next to...something.

Question #2 asked me to compare myself to a video game character.  I was given a choice of 5 or 6 such characters I never heard of. I checked...something.

A couple more questions followed, giving me choices of things I have never thought, felt, said or done.

Then came the Question that asked me to compare myself to one of several Tetris pieces.  Whatever THEY are.  Can you believe it?

Who designed this thing?  What science is behind it?  What demographic is it aimed at?  Was it actually tested on anyone for puzzle-personality-revealing accuracy?  

I'd love to see some comments here from people who took the quiz.  If you liked it, can you give a hint to your age, maybe?  Ditto, please, if you didn't like it and couldn't really find accurate answers to any of the questions posed.",2,negative,0.5550788640975952

"I was very late to the (actual) Monday puzzle this week due to travel. But I'm compelled to chime in on the drinks front -- and the VERMOUTH debate!

To my eye, the three theme ""adult beverages"" are all ones to be enjoyed whilst sipping -- indeed, are all WINEs.üç∂üç∑üç∏

Vermouth is a type of fortified wine. And our esteemed constructor, the (quite!) youthful Joe Marquez, likely knows it is popular on its own among his generation. Yes, Barry Ancona, everything old is new again, and your revisiting of the midcentury Martini & Rossi ad very apropos. 

My Gen-Z niece is a bartender on the LES and loves bringing us old-timers up to speed on what's hip to drink. This year's Christmas gift was homemade vermouth -- to be served over ice! üßä

‚Ä¢ This is four NYT puzzles in four months for Nate ‚Äì rare these days ‚Äì three Tuesdays and one Monday.  It‚Äôs plain to see why the NYT team likes his early week puzzles.  This is junk-free, with mostly everyday words, but for interest, also a few easily-crossed not-so-common entries, like ALTRUIST and ASSYMETRIC.
‚Ä¢ Lovely to see DOG crossing WAGS, and the PuzzPair¬© of COIL and SLINKY DOG.
‚Ä¢ @John Ezra ‚Äì this grid is full of answers perfectly suited to one of your stream-of-consciousness wondrous ramblings.  Please please please!
‚Ä¢ This is a tight theme.  You know it‚Äôs a tight theme when @Steven from Salt Lake City hasn‚Äôt posted a scroll of alternate answers (though the one he did post was prime!).
‚Ä¢ Props to Nate for coming up with this idea in the first place and thinking it worth making into a puzzle.  Yes it is!
‚Ä¢ Beautiful to see INKED at 49D crossing two INKS.
‚Ä¢ I eat a lot of tofu, but have never had or heard of STINKY TOFU.  Wikiipedia says it is said to smell like rotten garbage or smelly feet (see ODORS, YUCKY, and perhaps AGONY).  So, I will not be seeking it out.  (Maybe it‚Äôs good ‚Äì let me know!)
