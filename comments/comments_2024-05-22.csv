"I'm always happy when I remember previously new to me crossword glue! Today it was NENE! I wasn't totally confident but I was sure I remembered it from other puzzles and was confident enough to plug it in and see what happens! Huzzah!!! 

As for DONEE, I'm sad to say that I work in fundraising (no, I'm happy to say that, I love my work!) and the word DONor is in my job title, but that was one of my last fills. I was confident of all my surrounding answers except ALENE but I just couldn't understand how DONEE could be right. HA! I was sure it was wrong but then the happy music started after I plugged in ROME, which was great but took me way too long to figure out.

Anyhow, I liked this one a lot! Fun theme!! Definitely learned some things, too! Some trickier spots for me but was able to work it out.

"I know what an Egg Cream Soda is because of Spider-Man.

I know Goren on Bridge because I vaguely remembered that name in the puzzles section of the newspaper back when I was a kid. (The irony of people complaining about a freaking giant of the puzzle section of the newspaper while doing a crossword in the puzzle section of the newspaper is entertaining to me).

I pronounced 'donee' this morning in about 18 different ways 'dobee? docee?' because I am ignorant of Idaho geography and was surprised when it was right, but I don't expect to know everything, and crosswords would be pretty boring if they consulted with me every morning to make sure I'd heard of every person or place they thought of using.

I've never heard of Horace or Thomas, but that's probably my fault, but I certainly am familiar with being on the lam (but that story is for a different comment section), so I guessed and figured it out.

I couldn't name a single state bird, and in 20 minutes I probably won't remember Hawaii's either, but at least I kind of know until lunchtime.

Maybe I'm an old softie, but I guess part of my teaching (and living) style is that we all have different pasts and knowledge bases, and if you're letting your hobbies make you angry because you didn't know something or you think, ""That's not fair, how could I know that?!!?!?!"" maybe it's time to look inside and realize that you know it and get it now.

"The heat in today's comments around NENE made me wonder. Seems there must be a puzzler's term (analogous to ""Natick"") for the short words that are wildly overrepresented in crossword puzzles because they are so convenient to the constructor trying to complete a block.

These words, the crossword equivalent of cliches, eventually become a near-automatic part of the solver's toolkit. They are sometimes obscure (NENE) but not necessarily (OREO). New candidates arise (AC/DC). Others, once ubiquitous, go out of fashion (ERLE Stanley Gardner and Mel OTT) but still resurface occasionally as nostalgia for old-time puzzlers.

On the off-chance no term exists, ""Nene"" actually seems like a a good candidate. It certainly has staying power -- I remember getting short shrift when complaining about it to an experienced puzzler and that was almost 50 years ago.",15,neutral,0.7168591618537903

In a way, I'm disappointed to know that because I was enjoying the intensity of my curiosity so much.

All of the themers are well-chosen and interesting, but SWEETBREADS is the marquee entry for me.

A word about SWEETBREADS and why the dish might have been thusly named.  It sure sounds a lot more appetizing than ""thymus"" or ""pancreas"", doesn't it?

"A fun theme, and the double misnomers used in the puzzle are all things I like.  I especially agree with Erma Rombauer who quipped of SWEETBREADS ‚ÄúWhat foods these morsels be.‚Äù But the double non-misnomer that appears in the clues is better than all of them ‚Äî the legendary Philly cheesesteak (although some might quarrel that when made with cheez wiz, the second part is indeed a misnomer).  It‚Äôs often imitated, but never equaled in other areas.  Pat‚Äôs and Geno‚Äôs in the heart of South Philly get all the publicity when out of towners report on Philly culture, but IMHO a better steak can be had at the recently reopened Jim‚Äôs on South Street, and the roast pork sandwich (order it loaded with provolone and hot peppers) at Dinic‚Äôs in the Reading Terminal is for my money better than any cheesesteak.

I loved the clue for INGRATES.",11,positive,0.9280135631561279
"DONEE? Argh. I had to look it up even after I finished. Other than that, I enjoyed this one.
 Also agree that Goren and Nene is rough.",7,positive,0.8455400466918945
"Very nice, clever puzzle. I enjoyed solving it.",4,positive,0.984176754951477
"I was LOSING MY MIND finding where my mistake was.

INGRATES crosses with NEW in the same way INGRATOS crosses with NOW. I was screaming at the sky....",3,negative,0.8018251657485962
"Did anyone else have COARSE before HOARSE? I also had ABBA before AC/DC based on the first letter. (70‚Äôs music is not my forte.)

To continue Steve L‚Äôs challenge, Indian summer.",4,neutral,0.8000024557113647
"Now that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about!  Great theme!  Pleasant amount of resistance.  Adored the cluing on ROME, INGRATES, and ONION.  I‚Äôm definitely not an AC/DC fan but I love Brian ENO so l‚Äôll let it slide.  A massive improvement over the past few days.  Nice!",9,positive,0.9802640676498413
"Looking at 14A as a Philadelphian and I already know I'm unhappy, since it's either misspelled or misused based solely on the number of letters.",9,negative,0.9279797077178955
"Chinese checkers.
Jerusalem artichokes.
Strawberries.
And apparently, several medical conditions consisting of two words, neither of which are accurate.

Anyone else?",17,negative,0.7279042601585388
Very entertaining and lively! Just today my Facebook feed contained a Venn diagram of [things containing grapes] and [things containing nuts] which overlapped to some extent--and then off in a corner was a little circle with [Grape-Nuts] inside it.,13,positive,0.9237416386604309
"Good theme, not thrilled about the GOREN/NENE crossing, but it was my only square left, so I was able to brute force it",6,positive,0.6259405612945557
"Straightforward puzzle today, but I thought that there might be something deeper going on. Specifically the theme is Double Misnomers, but in addition I counted at least 13 words with consecutive double letters in them, e.g, ABOO, AAS.  For me that‚Äôs enough to be highly unusual, so I thought that the theme might expand and incorporate all of those instances as well.",5,neutral,0.8216555118560791
