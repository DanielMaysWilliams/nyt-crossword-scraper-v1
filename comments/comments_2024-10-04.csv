I paused again at ORGANIC -- would it be EGGS or MEAT? -- but it was BEEF.  I gave the side-eye to the clue for DINE (38A) -- which was the only clue that truly baffled me -- but I think it was pretty tortured.  Nice clues for NOISE LAWS and NUMERO.  But couldn't something cleverer and more entertaining have been done for AU NATUREL?

Never mind.  I'm cluing a new puzzle right now, and AU NATURAL just gave me an idea for a very off-beat clue I can try for one of the answers.  Too off-beat?  We'll see.

Alphas, now?  Why are we so bound and determined to name  and proclaim new ""generations"" the nanosecond they emerge from the womb?  Don't we have our craws full of identity politics already?

And speaking of that:  Re 29A:  Will they just keep adding more and more letters until every letter in the alphabet has been used at least once?

Conclusion:  This is a constructor who just doesn't do ""Hard.""  Friday is probably not the best day for her, but OTOH, it's a themeless, so what can you do?

"About a month ago, I summoned the courage to visit a proctologist, and confide of my ‚Ä¶ irregular regularities in, let‚Äôs say, his area of expertise.

He sent me home with some self-care and we scheduled a follow-up.

That was today.

I came back and told him things were just as bad, if not, worse. He asked if I had followed his prescription. I said, ‚ÄúYes, of course! A fiber-rich, fried food-less diet with a daily probiotic and a weekly enigma. I just can‚Äôt figure it out!‚Äù

He looked at me, inscrutably. 

Needless to say, we never got to the bottom of it.

"I had finished this one pretty smoothly, or so I thought, but a pesky typo kept me staring at the grid for a good bit.  Eventually I caught my mistake.  There were some unfamiliar answers (CIARA, WEN) due to my lack of familiarity with rap/hip hop artists and Chinese models, but that‚Äôs what crosses are for, and the typo was the bigger glitch.

I did get ITALIANHERO pretty quickly despite the fact that here in the ETAT Pennsylvanie (more specifically the Philadelphia area) we call them Italian hoagies.  Hoagie is one of the most distinctive geographic linguistic markers, along with gum bands for the Pittsburgh area, and bubblers for Wisconsin.  Viva such regional anomalies, long may they last.",17,neutral,0.48877471685409546

1. AU NATUREL is how to spell what I thought was AU NATURaL. 

2. sub sandwich has the same number of letters as ITALIAN HERO.",24,neutral,0.8475215435028076
"I stubbed my toe, badly, when I misspelled 59A as AUNATURAL and it took me ages to find it. The cross was no help, what do I know about models?
Super puzzle, btw.",68,negative,0.9180261492729187

"Despite the longest clues being 11 characters long there were a lot more multiple word answers than I was expecting.  With just two proper names (of people) it was also a bit easier than I was expecting from a Friday puzzle but still had some trivia I had to find my way to. The skincare brand was new to me, for one.",7,positive,0.7179692387580872
