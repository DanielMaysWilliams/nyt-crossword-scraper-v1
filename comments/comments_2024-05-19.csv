"I hold a graduate degree in Linguistics from Yale University.

People should be aware that the word ""octopus"" is Greek, not Latin (oktopous in classic Greek). Its plural is therefore ""octopodes."" Not ""octopi"" which uses a Latin plural form (like alumnus:alumni).

So, using the most common form of creating plurals in English, namely adding an ""s"" or ""es"" is completely acceptable. How many people on this list participate in on-line forums? How many of these forum participants call them ""forae""?

English usage commonly uses the ""s"" form to create plurals of foreign words, even when the word is already plural. Anyone heard somebody cringe at the word ""candelabras""? 
Well, candelabra is already the plural of ""candelabrum,"" so it's a ""double plural."" How about ""tortellinis""? Or ""antennas""? Or ""formulas""? It should be ""formulae"" and ""antennae,"" but who ever says that?

Let's let ""octopuses"" and ""octopi"" live together comfortably in the English language, at least until some pedant insists on people using the correct plural form --""octopodes.""",24,neutral,0.8557435274124146

"A great puzzle even with the **shudder** butchering of my relative at 98D. 

I was amused by the proximity of ASSHAT to WAZOO, too! üòé

OK, now for the requisite rant:

We go through this every time the execrable OCTOPI appears in a puzzle. As awful as it is, I reluctantly concede that it is a valid plural for a crossword. 

However, my marine biology students learn never to use it. I have to assume that some marine biologist, somewhere, has used this unpleasant plural, but I sure don't know one, and I know several who work with OCTOPUSES. (That's the plural we typically use in normal writing, but in some contexts, OCTOPODES or OCTOPODS  would be appropriate; but only the most annoying pedant who is trying to flex their pedantry would use those in normal speech or writing, and they're generally used to apply to the entire clade of OCTOPUSES as a group.) 

Oh -- and in the culinary world, I believe OCTOPUS can be both singular and plural, similar to how the plural of FISH can be FISH or FISHES, depending on how many species are in the pan/catch/whatever. 

Come to think of it, biologists also use the same algorithm to pluralize FISH, but I don't think I've heard biologists apply it to OCTOPUS.",6,positive,0.8101130723953247

Part of that half hour was taken up by worrying about ""POPOFF,"" which I actually had correct. (In the TikTok sense, at least.)

It provided excellent substantiation that every constructor has an individual, distinct and unique voice.

In this grid, however, it's as if Hall and Iverson have mind-melded, because it's very seamless and wittily clued throughout, and the doppelganger aspect (both senior editors of the two great bi-coastal newspapers, both of similar age, both parents, both seeking inspiration in the everyday moments) reinforces this feeling that it would be hard to point to whose clue/entry is whose.

I got the above answer on my second Across run. It's a very hard theme since the phrase itself has to be constructed word by word until you find the substitution. The rest of the clues were easy enough, though. 28 minutes, no mistakes",4,neutral,0.7353246808052063
"As I skimmed through the beginning clues before I started the puzzle, I was dreading that the fill for 12A was going to be PRIDE, because it would fit and I couldn't come up with another five letter word..

In Greek tragedy, hubris is specifically the overweening PRIDE that leads to the destruction of the protagonist. Hubris is not a synonym of PRIDE, hubris is ARROGANT PRIDE.  

Muddled meanings drive me nuts.",7,negative,0.8035725355148315
"Not too hard for a Sunday (for me!). Kept going back to the TEN to ONES part as one highlighted the other and I was imagining and contriving some kind of meaning for the D => N trick. None there, and didn‚Äôt look at the puzzle name early enough to figure out the hint. 

Had Lassie for SNOOPY for the longest time, throwing the SE off. Doh!",11,positive,0.4781114161014557
"""...the simple trick is evident: Swapping a congested ‚Äúd‚Äù for a clearheaded ‚Äún‚Äù...""

"After so many Sundays filled with Dad jokes, we were giggling our way through this puzzle that seems to us to be chock full of Mom jokes.  Thank you Christina & Katie, for reminding us how much fun we had trying to converse with our toddlers as we made our way through various colds and allergies, during those years.  The resulting abused (toddler) language is still part of our family conversation.",19,positive,0.9283175468444824
"For 120 across (Dog with a star), I was ambivalent between  SNOOPY and SCOOBY (as in Scooby-doo) before the crosses made it clear.

Although this did give me an idea for a clue if I ever decide to write my own crossword puzzle: ""Cartoon Dog that becomes another cartoon god when two letters are changed"".  (Of course this ignores the second part of Scooby-doo's name, but he is frequently referred to as just Scooby, so I guess that would make it legit :-).)",7,neutral,0.7699072957038879
"Because I initially had SLAP for SHARP HIT, it looked like the king of Israel was going to be LEROY. Fortunately I discovered my error before the end. Otherwise, as one of the attendees at an All-Twins convention remarked, I would have been in a heap of doubles. It was a fun puzzle‚Ä¶",9,neutral,0.5038636326789856
"Re 54D (POP OFF) - that phrase seems to have quite a few meanings, per Merriam-Webster:

-  To die unexpectedly
-  To leave suddenly
-  To talk thoughtlessly and often loudly or angrily

The last one is the one I'm familiar with, rather than the sense given in the clue.  Definitely a bit of modern slang I didn't know.",3,neutral,0.746268093585968
"I loved this one. Fast paced, yet challenging with a wonderful theme/wordplay.",3,positive,0.9889686107635498
"All of the thematic clues had some punny humor to them but I did not get 110 across: ‚ÄúTHATS A DOUGH BRAIDER‚Äù. I know that challah is braided bread but the answer doesn‚Äôt seem to nicely sound like a common saying.

Is this some supremely clumsy variation on ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a deal breaker‚Äù?

And what does a tour guide have to do with it?

Can anyone explain?",1,negative,0.7266613245010376

"There were some good puns this week; it took me 55 minutes which is a bit quicker than my usual norm.  The ‚Äúdough braided‚Äù clue took me the longest to solve as there were two changes here.

Overall, a fun puzzle to solve without too many gimmicks.",4,positive,0.9535138010978699
ACROSTIC: Balton and Stewart served up a yummy and challenging puzzle. Over ten clues related to the quote. Great fun!,5,positive,0.9844974279403687
"I'm always happy when I don't fat-finger a letter (I always do these on my phone) and have to spend 3 or 4 minutes trying to find my typo. Especially so on the bigger, therefore smaller squared, Sundays. 
Enjoyed  this straightforward puzzle, but the theme was pretty plain and the clues a tad on the simple side. Still a  1.",2,positive,0.8551288843154907
"With the variety of places a puzzling element can occur (in the clues, in the black squares, in the answers), today‚Äôs started right off with deciphering the title! I thought, hold your GAZE?? Hold your TOES?? before realizing, duh, NOSE.

Then I got to the challah, and thought ‚Äúdough brainer‚Äù was pretty funny (I mean, the really big ones could do some damage) before realizing we had to hold our nose twice on that one.

I thought the saran and sari answer might have been DELHIWRAP (or DELIWRAP with the number of letters) but I was too punny for my own good!,52,neutral,0.5870704054832458
"A very disappointing week, in terms of difficulty.

Also, I have said this before, but OCTOPI infuriates me. Maybe add a ""(var.)"" at the end of the clue to placate the sticklers like me, who, believe that the accepted plurals of 'octopus' are 'octopuses', or the less common (but more correct) 'octopodes'. OCTOPI is plain incorrect, and is always given as the second, or sometimes third, choice for the plural in dictionaries.
