"Another very enjoyable one! It did seem daunting at first, with all those lovely long spanners! I think the only things I had on the first round were ONO, ATHENA, CTRL P, and OPRAH. Influential women and computer shortcuts, I guess that's my wheelhouse!  

But little by little it came together. My last area was in the Northeast with the crossing of an animal I've never heard of and a front man I've never heard of but it only came down to the U, which I first put an A in... No happy music and I thought U seemed the next likely suspect. Happy music! No lookups, so happy HeathieJ! 

There were some other proper nouns in there that I didn't know but they all worked out for me in crossings and overall I felt like it was not too difficult. I finished well under my average. Somehow, I remembered the gist of IMARETS from past puzzles, so hopefully that'll be more quickly filled in next time.

"Fabulous puzzles these past few days!

They had me singing ""Wonder of wonder, miracle of miracles..."" as I finished ‚Äì especially today's.

When, at the start, I took one look at the empty grid full of spanners, I sulked. 
But slowly and surely, it all came together, like raw ingredients that one would never believe could turn into a beautiful cake that you were capable of baking.

I ate it up, with only two lookups (names), seeing that I'm too impatient to let the crosses reveal them.
And then I felt a magnificent sense of achievement at the end. 

Whenever I sense that the puzzle must have been easy if I, with limited experience, was able to solve it, I think of a contructor's brilliance and precision in creating a grid where the crosses are just so, perfectly fitting together, making a puzzle daunting at first but doable as we go along.

Nice to have a gimmick-less puzzle. I always enjoy them.,8,positive,0.9708353877067566
"For me, 14D and 24A formed a really nasty NATICK.

I'd never heard of  EMEKA Okafor, but I had heard of PToS,  Parent-Teach Organizations.  

But while PTAS was the primary organization when I was a kid, I've lived in places with PToS.  

Consequently, there was no way for me to know that it wasn't EMEKo and PToS, rather than EMEKA and PTAS.

"This was another relatively breezy late-week puzzle. It did not put up much of a fight, despite the fact that I was bit tired from walking 6-plus miles through Central Park, down Fifth Avenue, across Bryant Park and Times Square, and up Broadway to Columbus Circle.

All the credit goes to Adrian for somehow managing the stack three beautiful spanners in both the N and S. I'll also admit that (1) I'm a fan of Agassi and 55D was therefore a gimme, and (2) my mind went straight to lingerie for 1A and voila, the answer fit perfectly, without any help from crosses. Lucky night, perhaps.",10,positive,0.6810688972473145
"I knew instantly that the 1A clue referred to lingerie, but VICTORIA‚ÄôS SECRET didn‚Äôt spring to mind. Neither of the other spanners at the top was obvious, so I think 21A NEB was my first entry. 

The bottom section went very quickly. Perhaps my biggest mistake was assuming that Andre Agassi (55A) was an Italian-AMERICAN. 

And when all I had of 1D was the final NA, I briefly considered the possibility of a fur-bearing iguaNA. 

Thanks for the fun, Mr. Johnson!",7,neutral,0.7954862713813782
"It's the sheer globalism of this one, its vast diversity and inclusiveness, across time & space, that really makes my inner yeti start gulping a peaty scotch to his ruin (and if you think vicuna wool is rare, try finding a yeti sweater anywhere: it's no can do in Kathmandu) OK, that metaphor got a little out of hand, but you know what I'm saying. 

Like the two goddesses spanning time, Athena & Oprah. Victoria's Secret crossing with celibacy. The Bard sharing space with a nitro car and a hypeman. Which Shakespearean character can best be called a hypeman? Falstaff? Marc Antony, using his oration at Caesar's funeral to whip up the crowd? And which delivers the best tirade? Lady Macbeth? King Lear?

Love the elements of antiquity and the Middle East at play here, with the return of that pinnacle of crosswordese, imaret, plus the Call on the Carpet (one thinks, a la Agassi, it must be a Persian carpet the poor lackey has been called upon), PTAS -- like PITAS said with mouth full, shekels -- first I had ""drachma"" (from the parable in Luke) but its plural, unlike BAHT, has an ""s."" Just thought I'd rub it in, editors. 

Moving on in one direction, the Parthenon, in the other, yeti and Holi, as if we're on google maps moving our cursor from one continent to the next; next stop Nigeria, home of Orafor's parents, then to Lima, the vicuna and the Americas. It's fascinating to me that The Americas exclude North America, otherwise, wouldn't LA take the cake? Lift up the cake? Hoist it?",46,neutral,0.4605846405029297
"VICTORIASSECRET was my first thought, but for some reason I rejected that answer and didn't think of it again until the very end. Despite being an avid tennis fan, I only knew IRANIANAMERICAN because my friend happened to mention it to me Wednesday after we saw Challengers (for the fourth time). The two main characters are, in part, inspired by Sampras and Agassi, and my friend told me that Sampras was Jewish, while Agassi was Iranian.

Not thrilled with the VICUNA/IMARET/URIE crossing, though I did happen to know that Nebraska was the only state without a bicameral legislature. ROEG/GULP/PARDNER wasn't fun, either",1,neutral,0.5020793080329895
"An elegant puzzle. Maybe more of a Friday level. My quibble is if you have a lot of stacks like this I think you need to make the clues obtuse enough that you have to get some crosses before getting it. The VICTORIAS SECRET one while clever seemed totally obvious to me. And when I can so quickly fill in the top like that it immediately reduces the challenge on the rest of the grid (the bottom spanner also was a little bit easy). And there were really a lot of nice fill and clues in this puzzle. So no complaints about the grid or fill, just a bit too straightforward clueing for a Saturday IMHO.",5,positive,0.7041451334953308
"I've never heard the phrase ""CALL OUT THE CARPET"" before - is this an older term or something?",4,neutral,0.7406674027442932

And a very pretty grid design it is, too.
Someday I will automatically be able to fill in IMARETS for Turkish inns, but today was not that day.

"Before he was the NBA Rookie of the Year in 2004-2005, the amazing Emeka Okafor was MVP of the 2004 NCAA Men‚Äôs Basketball Championship.

Before he played professionally for Charlotte, he played his college ball in Storrs CT, basketball capital of the world. 

(That was the second basketball national championship for the UConn men; they now have six, including the last two. The UConn women have an astounding eleven championships.)

"Wow.  At first look I thought ""great, here's the new editors' revenge for all the easy ones that have been fattening us up lately for a Saturday slaughter tonight"".

But then I was really able to breeze through the whole puzzle, with only small moments of panic.  Possibly a ""personal best"" Saturday time (I don't really check these things or use the timer).

A deceptively solvable affair!  Nice work.  Just barely enough toeholds to climb it with the right attitude and a few good guesses.",9,positive,0.7140471935272217
"Great puzzle! 1A jumped off the page at me and I breezed through the top half, humming to myself. Then I fell flat on my face in the lower half, seemingly forgetting  what language I was reading. Nothing made sense. A couple of crosses in the SW finally emerged, and the rest slowly percolated through. Whew.
This is what a Saturday should be.",25,positive,0.8342822790145874

"Wow, that was a fast solve for something that seemed daunting at first. I had enough of the Downs to get toeholds in the long Across entries, so they mostly filled in quickly. Although for some reason I had thought Vermont might be the unicameral state, at least I hadn't put it in. Conclusion: fun to do, but it went by too fast.",42,positive,0.8419373035430908
