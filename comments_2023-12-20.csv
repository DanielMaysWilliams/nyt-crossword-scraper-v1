This was hard for me.  I am thinking most found it difficult? I‚Äôm afraid of what I‚Äôm gonna read. Xwstats says 68% of solvers solved slower than their avg. 35% more than 20% slower.  

After staring at my completed puzzle for 10 minutes, I just gave up on the themers/ revealer connection.  No chance I get that without reading the column. No chance. 

Like sometimes when you have only four words left in connections and just stare at the words trying to figure it out. But eventually punting, highlighting the four remaining words, and finding out what the connection was. 
Yesterday‚Äôs connection was like that.

TAPPETBROS:   nil

TAPPETBROTHERS: nada

CLICK: 14 appearances (8/6) half sound half relationship

One of the reasons may be that I have no idea who or what Dear Abby is so the theme did not help me at all. 

The constructor obviously operates on another wavelength than me, too, as I found many clues overly cryptic. Sometimes everything just falls into place for me, also on Saturdays and Sundays, but not today.

TOILE was one of the things I had to look up even though I had 4 out of its 5 letters. We have a similar name for the material in Polish - tiul, which approximates the original French pronounciation in Polish, I suppose - but _OILE was so far removed from that I had no idea what the missing letter might have been.

And then there were words the likes of ARISTA and ROLF... ROLF, really...

"Nice puzzle, and sort of trip to memory lane. I've lived in places where both columnists were placed on the same page, and remember Ann specifically admitting that she was encountering some of the same problems as her readers (a divorce).

Not much trouble with the themers, but got led astray by NEARby instead of TO, and TUSKEd instead of TUSKER. The crossings were nice and got me close enough to recognize IMARET and AESIR, and my guess for AMON RA turned out to be good, confirmed by the presence of the company NEAR TO my former home.

"Funny, when I got to 27A and filled in LANDERS, I thought immediately of ANN LANDERS, without even realizing I had just filled in ANN right next to it.  (Or maybe I hadn't gotten there yet, which would better explain why I didn't notice the two names side by side.)

I then proceeded to forget about the fact that the name LANDERS could also mean a vehicle that touches down on another heavenly body.

I'll also mention that IMARET went right in, as it is one of those words that appears more often in crosswords (95 times) than in real life (never, for me), and it's one you know if you've been solving for a while.  It's also a word that only has one cluing option, although it's been worded in various ways.
