Yes, Mr. Constructor, for me, a question mark would have helped with 32A, Patient check-ins.

With language in NYT puzzles increasingly incorporating terms formerly considered crass, I was dismayed by 8A, Crapper, and disappointed that the constructor was proud of it. Oh, sure, it's an old word, et cetera, but please, no more.

I entered ""corn lot"" for ""corn pit."" Having never watched ""WKRP (speaking of KRP) in Cincinnati"" and therefore not knowing Tom (who may not exist) from Tim Reid (58A), that mistake potentially worked. Corn LOT for PIT also  made 54A, Kitchen mess, ""slatter"" instead of ""spatter."" Wondered whether that word had come from the same root as ""slattern.""

"Perfect combo of twists on the known using sly clues, and the sprinkling of the unknown  - what a Saturday puzzle should be.  What is the fun of racing through easy-peasy when you can learn about Ecuador and corn pits? (All post-hoc, of course.)  Add to that the wonderful philosophical, paradoxical take on ""THERE ARE NO WORDS"" (7D).  I will use that one for sure.  And the chuckle is worth double when figuring out that CRAPPER (8A) is the surprise dark answer to the simple ""Can"" clue.    
I remembered from the show that TIM (58A) was either REID or RIED and the joy of a Saturday puzzle is try to build around either/both.  GOLFBAG (1D) sharpens that sense of taking nothing for granted on a Saturday.  I even had ""LOG"" pencilled in as the last three letters for a bit.  
To answer the Constructor's query:  I don't think a question mark would have made a difference in 32A - would have tried to jam in ""WINDOW"" (a la slider window at the reception desk) at the end

As our society lamentably wallows in a decline of dignity in public discourse, so seems to follow the course of NY Times puzzle contributors, assisted and abetted by uncritical editing.

There's no excuse or rationalization for the 8A entry. It's a rude and discordant word that few would use in polite mixed company. Basic, attentive editing could have easily altered it to be CRAMPED, by 11d being MER, and 14d being DEPRESS, and a clever clue could easily have been substituted for ""Can"".

Just as the editors regularly see fit to permit the inclusion of, or cutesy cluing for, a vulgar term for the buttocks (or its equally rude British equivalent), today's puzzle is indicative of an abandonment of a formerly reliable level of decency on this page.

I was relieved that the GENTLE REMINDERS were not from any of my doctors -- another answer clued in a misleading way.

OK, my nits.  There are two of them crossing each other and they're both singular-vs-plural related.

You don't find one wood in a GOLF BAG (1D).  The clue should be ""woodS source"".

And in the same way:  BONDS (23A) is a plural and should be clued by ""unitS in a financial economics course.""  Yes, I know that in economics you speak of BONDS as a Thing, but this isn't an economics course -- this is a puzzle where the singular/plural agreement rules are much stricter.

One hesitant New Year's resolution later, and here I am.

I am not a fast solver. I have to look things up (especially sports). But man, oh man, it is so satisfying to complete a crossword! To know an answer outright, or to take a guess and be vindicated after more fill, or to just look at a smattering of letters and see the words they could be... Is there a word for that feeling?! 

I'm not great by any means, but I'm better than I was three months ago. This Saturday solve, though VERY tough for me - especially in the NW - feels like a high note.

Spring break is over, I'll be back to my normal work and mom grind. I will keep solving, but I probably won't engage in these comments anymore (not that I would expect anyone to notice). From the short time I was actively engaged in this forum, I just want to say this:

Be kind to each other. We're all here because we love words and puzzles. Be helpful, be positive, be charitable. Keep encouraging people to discover and enjoy whatever puzzling they can or want to do. It's the NYT crossword! It's amazing!

Thank you constructors, editors, kind commenters, and emus.",110,positive,0.6292172074317932
And for those who need to know.  Thomas CRAPPER was the English plumber (fl. latter C19) who invented the water closet and the U bend and generally did a lot to improve domestic hygienic.  It is tempting to assume that his name is the etymological source for the vulgarism often used for that necessary human function but not so.  It may be an early example of nominative determinism  because that word predates Mr Crapper by decades or centuries (opinions differ).,24,neutral,0.740598201751709

"TAKEONE or TAKETWO before ONEEACH anyone?

Does anyone know if you go into the archive, pick a puzzle in the middle of your streak, and reset that puzzle, if that will break your streak?  I was looking at my stats and saw my Friday best has an improbably low time.  If I wanted to reset and re-do that puzzle is my streak affected?",15,neutral,0.8189699649810791
"For a bit, I thought I was going to get stuck somewhere. I had quickly put in LEBANON, but I took it out because I thought 28A ‚ÄúGreenery in a rock garden‚Äù was going to be moss. I was slow to get GOLF BAG because I couldn‚Äôt see the clubs for the trees. 

But I figured out the NW and that was it, except for a typo in PROPANE. 

Thanks, Mr. Slonecker!",13,negative,0.5648775696754456
"Oh, glorious! An epically hard puzzle that songs will be sung about (sample verse: OMG, OMG, OMG this is hard!!).

As you can tell, Blake Slonecker's definitely going in my ""Big Book of Cruciverbalists to Love and Fear (Mainly Love)"". There were virtually no gimmes in today's grid: every single letter felt like a small victory, and every single answer a cause for celebration. I had to hide the clock at about the 1:30 mark because it was most definitely mocking me -- kudos to the software engineers for making it morph into Miss Minutes üòÄ
 
I was going to list a few of my favorite clues, but I realize that that would involve simply repeating the *entire* puzzle. So let me just say that THEREARENOWORDS for how happy I am that Blake was able to put together such a stellar piece of work (oh, and lest we forget, Joel did a fine job of editing!).",31,positive,0.9040864706039429

"Another winner of a construction, raising the ante in the puzzles game.  An exaggeration, but you might say I felt a little like Molly Bloom at the end of Ulysses when I dropped in the last letter.

Some especially scintillating clues:
Wood source 
When we forged ahead
Like some schools
When the lights go out
Paradoxical line of amazement
Culprits behind some forced retirements

The list could go on until almost all of the clues were included, but you solved it‚Äîyou know what I mean. Perfect for a Saturday (and if you raced through it without having to stop and think, please don't tell me).

You're an artist, Blake Slonecker.  Thank You.",38,positive,0.8710497617721558

Wonderful puzzle with terrific clues. 

The very best in a long while.

"Beautiful puzzle, crapper notwithstanding.  A beast, especially while toggling between Knicks and NCAA b-ball games.  

The clue for ABIDE is such a Will Shortz-influenced clue.  Will, hope you are doing better each day.  Peace to all and praying for peace this Easter weekend.",58,positive,0.9642106890678406

"For me this was a slow and steady chipping away at the blank squares. I really liked the shape of the puzzle. The NW was the last quadrant to fall, especially the crossing of IN A HOLE and FHA. I tried  for REMINDERS that were SUBTLE before they were GENTLE.",23,positive,0.9155609011650085
