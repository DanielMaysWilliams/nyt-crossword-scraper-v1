"Dearest Fellow Crosswordians, 

After perusing the NYT Crossword Submission Guidelines, wherein it states, ""Avoid... partial phrases longer than five letters (‚ÄúSo ___‚Äù for BE IT would be permissible, while ‚ÄúSo ___‚Äù for IT GOES would not.)"", you can imagine my shock upon arriving at 34A, where the partial phrase ""Come on, ___!"" requests a SIX LETTER ANSWER. 

Now I don't know whether six is greater or fewer than five where you come from, but you here in Reno, Nevada, it most certainly is. Frankly, I demand an explanation for this! Perhaps Mr. Shortz's recent ___ (medical event: 6 letters) has left a ___ (gaping maw: 4 letters) in the staff. (Note: the latter partial phrase would be acceptable while the former is not.) 

I mean: COME ON, PEOPLE! 

Yours Truely, 
K.T., Reno NV.

Usually in crosswords, I would put ROFL/ROTFL, even though in my own texts I do use the skull emoji. This is mostly just because I'm aware that most crossword constructors are older than Gen-Z.

I'm excited, because I've always privately felt that the Mini was a tad slangy (even for me), and the xword a bit outdated. I remember the 02.07.24 puzzle that was musically themed, but almost all the songs were from the 1970s or older. Struggled on that one :(

I have a word for you if you're thinking of sending me a SKULL in response to my funny text:

DON'T.

Well, actually it won't really matter anyway.  I'm visually incapable of distinguishing one teensy little emoji from another: they all look identical to me.  But I never have the heart to tell anyone -- not even my own brother to whom I have never been anything but completely honest about everything else.  He recently seems to have developed this strange predilection for sending one single emoji instead of actually writing something in response to many of my emails and I don't know what he's trying to say.  Are they smiling or grimacing?  Is it always the same emoji? Could one of them possibly have been a... SKULL???

*oh, and CLOSEBUTNOCIGAR is 15 letters. Been an answer in 9 puzzles. One of those (appropriate for me) was a Monday from June 23, 2008. A couple of other theme answers in that one:

"Another great reason for doing the puzzle every day:  ARHAT
That sure went in fast for a word I had to get from the crosses yesterday.  

My first thought for I.M. innovator at 7D was Pei, who makes frequent appearances, but not today.  Otherwise, things flowed for me on this one.  For a debut, or really for any puzzle, this felt remarkably fresh and smooth.",7,positive,0.9527102708816528
"I loved it!

Challenging start with a satisfying conclusion and good building blocks in between.

The PEOPLE / MORTALS / CANNIBALS chain was probably just coincidental but then WELD met LSD and MELDS met LDS and the puzzle started to take shape.

"I‚Äôm apparently the only one who found this impenetrable. I had so few fills on a 12-minute first pass, and then was unable to get any crosses, I considered just letting it slide. It was so ‚Äúnot in my wheelhouse,‚Äù I turned to CHECK PUZZLE (which I consider less of a ‚Äúcheat‚Äù than actually looking up an answer), and my pseudo-solve was still glacial. Looking for the vowel in B*LL through a, e, i and o was just embarrassing. 

I couldn‚Äôt even figure out what to ask Siri: ‚ÄúHow would you characterize most Azerbaijani‚Äôs‚Äù yielded the ethnic tribe Tats as the only 4-letter possibility. Sheesh! 

When I finally pieced it together, everything seemed pretty straightforward. Can I chalk this up to getting a covid booster today?

"Well, yesterday (I think it was just yesterday) I commented on the Potato Head puzzle that I'd never encountered ARHAT, and didn't anticipate ever encountering ARHAT again. Wrong. Again. But in successive puzzles? 

I started out looking at multiple clues finding nothing to play until I wandered around (in a circuitous path) to 5D and ENIGMAS popped into my brain. So I laughed and played it, knowing it was destined to be erased. Then AMINO and GON crossed and the puzzle started solving itself. I really like when that happens. 

It was a fun Friday. Thank you Jake.",16,neutral,0.44975176453590393
A lot of fun.  45 minutes which is about average for a Friday; and some words I had no clue about such as ARHAT and GOT (never watched it) and Minecraft.  Had 'hands' then 'holds' for 11D.,5,positive,0.8362718820571899
"I‚Äôm not into streaks. But I realized I have a gold streak going for this month, so may as well try to gold the month.  

I thought I might be toast on this one. But ARHAT, my trusty repeat, literally saved me. It unlocked the top half this puzzle because it uncovered the seed entry, mechanical bull. 

Very nice Friday. Harder than I would have liked. And now I‚Äôm scared for Saturday. 

Grid looked cool as well

Congrats on the debut. Jake Bunch",13,positive,0.5813217163085938

"This was a BUNCH of fun. Liked the misdirection‚Äîalmost got caught a time or two, but managed to suss out the answers and finished in a fairly respectable time for me.

Very nice debut and I certainly hope to see some more from you coming our way. Thanks, Jake, and from my angle it was certainly jake.",23,positive,0.9636906385421753
"In response to Deb, I solve alone BUT am not opposed to help. Being in community with others is much more fun than just testing my own skills! I have a friend who loves baseball and I send him every baseball themed clue, whether I know the answer or not. His first response is always AROD, followed by the correct answer. It‚Äôs always funny! 

Thanks for a delightful puzzle today!",20,positive,0.8699104189872742
"I started at the SW when I saw ""Saint__,"" the only thing that came to me was ""Sa√´ns."" I doubted that this was the answer, so I took it as a sign to just listen to Saint-Sa√´ns while I solved.

Good thing I did. 
This puzzle took a lot of thinking and deducing, so listening to this helped me calm down and UNTWIST my mistakes along the way. 

ARHAT was a gimme. I wonder why...

Thank you for this lively and crunchy puzzle, Mr. Bunch, and congratulations on your debut! Many thanks to your test-solver as well.

"IMISSED Will last week and briefly considered joining the DESERTERS despite my 1200+ day streak. This week the clueing ENIGMAS seem to have settled down, and today was especially enjoyable. 26A and 35A were both tricky and smile-inducing. 

If ARHAT shows up again tomorrow, we all will have achieved Nirvana. According to xwordinfo, on average it has appeared once every two years since 1967.",5,positive,0.9236378073692322
"A delightful and witty debut, and a pleasantly brisk Friday, especially after the last few weeks. I struggled at first, bouncing around the grid in the hopes of gaining purchase somewhere, but finally the southeast started to break for me, and it was smooth sailing after that.

"One more demonstration of what I‚Äôve noted here before:

ARHAT two days in a row after not being seen in years. It happens all the time!

PEOPLE: all the daily NYT crosswords are composed by one guy, who comes in at 6 a.m. and submits the next day‚Äôs puzzle by 1 p.m. He gets paid in cash and then retires to his favorite watering hole to spend the afternoon with his three best friends (initials JB, JD, and sweet GR).

He constructs the puzzles himself but has a staff of 3 interns who compete at dreaming up the fake bios printed here along with the hilarious ‚Äòconstructor notes‚Äô. He‚Äôs never met them.

"Very enjoyable,  I had nothing for quite a while, then it suddenly all came together. One nit to pick: 14D. The speed of sound is the Mach Number, never MACH ONE.  Faster than the speed of sound it‚Äôs accepted to use, say, MACH TWO, but not at the speed of sound. Ernst Mach  never anticipated it as a travel parameter, and he died long before anyone even thought it possible to travel even 100 mph.

"To me this is an ideal Friday. Nice long fills with some twist clues, and what is there is tough but elegant. Every clue felt well done in this one. My own personal preference is that fill should resemble idiomatic usage when it comes to phrases and blank fills, and this was great in that respect. 

Side note: it‚Äôs interesting the fill streaks the puzzles have sometimes. In this case, arhat on consecutive days was a bit of a surprise (but made today easier).",43,positive,0.9709151387214661

"Interesting acronym placements today: The last 3 letters of 11 Down join 21 Across to form LDS, a short (but unofficial) form of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Days Saints rather lengthy name. A few columns over at 20 Down we find the same letters, ordered differently, forming LSD. Wonder if the similarity was one factor in the church‚Äôs recent emphasis on using its entire name, all nine words of it.",5,neutral,0.8655250072479248

"I had done several early-week puzzles from the archives earlier this evening. I started on this one and found myself thinking, boy, this is hard for a Wednesday. After a while I realized that today is Thursday and I was doing a Friday puzzle. Duh.

I had two sections in this one where I knew I'd put in something wrong but wasn't sure what, so I had to rip out words. They were the areas around DIN (where I tried ADO first) and TALK AT (where I tried BARK AT and NONET). Those areas were just so problematic looking that it was easier to start over with a clean slate. I really liked the clue for KENS.",10,neutral,0.5626861453056335
"Loved this tricky Friday, filled with misdirects and stuff I just plain didn't know, like GOT is short for a book by George RR Martin, Minecraft has  a protagonist named Steve, the meaning of a SKULL emoji, and that much of Azerbaijan's population is SHIA.   Made for a tough but fun solve.
