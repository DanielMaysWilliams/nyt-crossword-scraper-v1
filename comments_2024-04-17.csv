"“presumably the poker is the one who needs a better sightline.”

No! The poker is the one who poked 20A in the 73A !",26,neutral,0.6251302361488342
"18A isn’t ambiguous—it’s another reference to this puzzle’s theme. Odysseus famously defeated the cyclops by gouging (or “poking”) out its eye, and since the creature only had the one, it was blinded. It’s no coincidence that this answer begins with the one, circled “I” in this puzzle.",61,neutral,0.8578502535820007
"Sam Corbin:  18A.  “Cry after a poke” seems to be a reference to what one would say after being poked in the eye, similar to what happened to Polyphemus in The Odyssey - it isn’t a reference to poking someone to get a better view.",36,neutral,0.8170670866966248
"Alternate cluing for 18A:

""Words uttered by 20-Across, maybe""

Alternate cluing for 65A:

""How the hero of 41-Across got home""",13,neutral,0.8967759609222412
